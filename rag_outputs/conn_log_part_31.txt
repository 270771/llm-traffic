Ping flood alert: Analyze potential ICMP ping flood activity in this network log. The log contains 107 ICMP packets from 108 source IPs targeting 2 destination IPs, notably 54.239.183.175 and 133.250.121.54, indicating a high volume of ICMP traffic to these hosts.
Justified by anomaly: Matched anomaly ID anomaly_54, heuristic 20 (heuristic related to unusual connection patterns or traffic volume), taxonomy 'ntscICecrqICecrprp' (likely indicating network traffic anomalies or ICMP flood patterns).
â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from the source IPs targeting these destinations to mitigate potential ping flood attack.
