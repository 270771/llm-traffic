Ping flood alert: Analysis indicates a high volume of ICMP packets from multiple source IPs targeting a small set of destination IPs, notably 202.44.201.111, 133.118.10.145, and 167.105.118.85, with no corresponding anomaly records.
Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, but the pattern of numerous ICMP packets from multiple sources to limited targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from the identified source IPs to mitigate potential denial-of-service.
