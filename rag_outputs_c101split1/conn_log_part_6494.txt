Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP types 3, 11, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. Instead, these types correspond to:

- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded  
- Type 1: Echo Reply  

These indicate diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy entries are available. However, the observed ICMP types suggest normal network diagnostic traffic or error reporting, not an attack.

Next Steps:  
If there is suspicion of other ICMP-based attacks, monitor for unusual volume or patterns of these ICMP types. Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate error messages, as this could indicate misconfiguration or scanning activity. Specifically, verify if the ICMP type 1 (Echo Reply) from 157.206.194.66 to 185.194.205.188 is part of a legitimate response or anomalous behavior.
