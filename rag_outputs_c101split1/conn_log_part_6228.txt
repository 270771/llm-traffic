Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 and destination IP 180.187.124.162 for any other suspicious activity or repeated ICMP traffic, especially Echo Requests. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
