Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, and no such data is visible here.
- The connections mostly show failed TCP handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed failed TCP connection attempts could be investigated as potential port scanning or reconnaissance, which typically falls under heuristic categories related to network scanning.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 states) for possible scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify if these failed connections are part of a broader reconnaissance campaign.
