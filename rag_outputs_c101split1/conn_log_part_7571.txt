Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 13, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 0 is Echo Reply. These do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references can be made. However, if this traffic were to be investigated further, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration issues worth reviewing.

Next steps: Monitor for any surge in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs. Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages for potential network issues or reconnaissance activity.
