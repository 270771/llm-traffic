Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no other suspicious patterns, no attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets from a single source to a target, which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual, as this could indicate network issues or traceroute activity, but it is not an attack.
