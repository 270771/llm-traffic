Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, also not an echo request. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are multiple rapid ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the same source IP in a larger dataset or over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated unreachable messages that might indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
