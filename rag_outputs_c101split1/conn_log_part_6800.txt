Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there is a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This behavior is characteristic of a ping flood, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request Flood**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP is 35.83.191.13; destination IPs include 163.45.52.83, 163.45.16.27, 163.45.190.185, 163.45.164.180, 163.45.18.157, 163.45.179.73, 163.45.233.2, 163.45.100.6, 163.45.52.168, 163.45.203.253, 163.45.186.96, 163.45.120.74, 163.45.117.201, 163.45.120.66, 163.45.18.183, 163.45.71.130, 163.45.22.186, 163.45.207.6, 163.45.70.160, 163.45.238.249, 163.45.247.47, 163.45.170.61. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.83.191.13 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts or other suspicious activity from this IP or related sources.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
  5. Review and update firewall and router ACLs to prevent similar attacks in the future.
