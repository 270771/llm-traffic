Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which is `0` here. For a ping flood, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to verify ICMP types and rates. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
