Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `8` for both entries, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume is extremely low (only 1 packet per connection), and the connections are marked as `OTH` (other) state with no retransmissions or high frequency. This does not match the typical pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no anomalies are detected and the traffic volume is minimal, this does not indicate any attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from these IPs (143.5.202.233 to 163.45.94.50 and 203.78.151.93). If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. For now, no specific security action is required.
