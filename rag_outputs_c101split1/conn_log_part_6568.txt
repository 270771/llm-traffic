Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP connection from 203.78.140.213 to 209.148.195.45 has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8). The second connection from 133.243.206.29 to 23.41.104.6 has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request, but there is only a single such connection logged, not a flood or high volume of echo requests indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic for possible network routing or TTL issues, as these can indicate misconfigurations or other network problems.
