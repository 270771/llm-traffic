Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 8 from source 112.54.36.207 to destination 203.78.162.228, which is an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 0 from 133.243.6.38 to 185.187.179.45, which is an echo reply, not a request. The volume and timing of these packets do not indicate a flood pattern (e.g., rapid, repeated echo requests from one source to one destination). Also, the log snippet contains only two ICMP packets with no indication of high frequency or volume.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP echo request floods, and taxonomy class "DoS" (Denial of Service) would apply if a ping flood were detected.

Next steps:  
Monitor for a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination over a short time window. Investigate if any source IPs generate sustained bursts of echo requests, which could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
