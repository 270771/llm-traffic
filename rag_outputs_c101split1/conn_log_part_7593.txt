Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs, with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and there is no evidence of sustained or overwhelming traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood (which requires a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests), no attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this or other sources. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, consider correlating with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify emerging threats.
