Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 3, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.  
- ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, none of which indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known attack patterns can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.120, 133.243.115.209, 157.206.101.9) for potential other suspicious activity, as ICMP error and timestamp messages can sometimes be part of reconnaissance or other network issues.  
- Enable logging and monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Define or obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify and respond to anomalies in the future.
