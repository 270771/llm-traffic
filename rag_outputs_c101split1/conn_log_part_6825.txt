Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network captures specifically for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm if any ping flood attempts exist outside this snippet.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from single IPs.  
- Enable or review alerts for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.
