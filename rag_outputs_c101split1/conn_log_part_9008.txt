Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `3` (Destination Unreachable), not `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 157.206.194.1 to 141.226.80.19. If such traffic spikes, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
