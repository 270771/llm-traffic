Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. However, ICMP type 3 messages often indicate network issues or scanning activity and could warrant further investigation into network reachability or misconfigurations.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.169 and destination 93.149.110.49 for unusual ICMP error message patterns or network problems.
