Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicative of scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning (e.g., heuristic for SYN scan detection) and monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs. Further packet capture focusing on ICMP traffic is advised to conclusively rule out ping floods.
