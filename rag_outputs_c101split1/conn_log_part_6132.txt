Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no sustained or volumetric ICMP echo request traffic is observed, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks. Also, verify if the ICMP type 11 traffic is part of a traceroute or other benign activity.
