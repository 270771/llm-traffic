Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet recorded (count=1), and no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of echo requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack. The second entry is ICMP type 13 (timestamp request), which is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP echo request rate anomalies.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ping flood activity. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or ICMP traffic inspection on network devices to detect and mitigate such attacks proactively.
