Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 7th column after source IP and port) is `3` and `0` respectively, not `8`. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and neither entry is type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types used in network diagnostics and error reporting, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or repeated error messages that might indicate other network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If ICMP type 3 messages are frequent, verify network reachability and routing issues.
