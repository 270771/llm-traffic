Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from two source IPs—69.232.165.137 and 3.243.126.119—sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps clustered around 1641013236). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm network resources by saturating them with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations in a short time."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attackers: 69.232.165.137 and 3.243.126.119 (source IPs)  
- Targets: Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x and 203.78.x.x ranges  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (69.232.165.137 and 3.243.126.119).  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic sources for potential upstream filtering.  
4. Monitor network traffic for any collateral impact and verify that legitimate ICMP traffic is not unduly blocked.  
5. Consider blacklisting or quarantining the attacker IPs temporarily while investigating further.  
6. Review internal host and network device logs for signs of compromise or participation in the attack.
