Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP connections from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs, each with a single packet (`-` in packet count fields and `1` in the last field likely indicating one packet). This volume and pattern do not match a ping flood, which requires a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If this were a ping flood, heuristic #1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS:Attempt" would typically apply.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, verify if other types of ICMP traffic or unusual connection states appear that might indicate other attack types.
