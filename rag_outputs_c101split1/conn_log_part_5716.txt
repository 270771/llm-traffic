Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 13 and 0, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns that require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) surges or other suspicious traffic patterns. If ICMP type 8 packets appear in high volume, investigate for potential ping flood attacks.
