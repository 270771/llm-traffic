Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes are available from the provided data. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood heuristics.

Next steps:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, or reviewing other logs (e.g., icmp.log) for potential ICMP-based anomalies. Also, monitor for TCP-based anomalies such as SYN floods or port scans, as the current logs show many TCP connection attempts with SYN flags set but no successful connections.
