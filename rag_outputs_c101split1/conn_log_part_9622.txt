Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.76.5, 133.243.125.2, 133.243.76.8, etc.) are sending ICMP traffic to a single destination IP (34.17.112.111).
- The ICMP type field is 8 in all these entries, which corresponds to Echo Request packets, the type used in ping floods.
- The volume and concurrency of these ICMP Echo Requests from many sources targeting one destination strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this behavior aligns with a classic ICMP flood heuristic: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 34.17.112.111 (destination)
- Multiple attacker IPs: 133.243.76.5, 133.243.125.2, 133.243.76.8, 133.243.76.6, 133.243.25.41, 133.243.25.40, 133.243.25.70, 133.243.206.51, 133.243.192.118, and others.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 34.17.112.111.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the identified attacker IPs if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve defenses.
