Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood or other attacks can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm absence of ping flood.
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from any IPs.
- Analyze TCP SYN flood or scanning heuristics if suspicious TCP connection patterns persist.
