Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.  
- ICMP traffic would be indicated by protocol number 1, and the ICMP type field would be required to confirm a ping flood (type 8 = echo request). Here, all protocols are either UDP (17) or TCP (6).  
- No ICMP type 8 packets are present, so no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show failed or incomplete TCP/UDP handshakes (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or misconfiguration but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the S0 state typically corresponds to "Connection attempt failed" and may relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of failed UDP connections from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x hosts on port 5060 (commonly SIP). This could indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging and verify if any ICMP echo requests (type 8) appear in other logs to rule out ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on these UDP attempts.
