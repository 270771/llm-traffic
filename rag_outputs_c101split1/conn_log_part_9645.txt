Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the packet counts are very low (30 packets each) and the duration is extremely short (around 7 milliseconds), indicating normal ping traffic rather than a flood. Additionally, there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations or repeated attempts that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume or rate from these IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes significantly, re-evaluate for potential ICMP flood or DoS attack.
