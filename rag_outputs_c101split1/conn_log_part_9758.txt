Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.243.206.29 to two different destination IPs (23.205.239.7 and 104.124.222.249). However, there is only a single ICMP echo request per destination, not a high volume or rapid succession of packets indicative of a ping flood. The other ICMP entry has type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to multiple or single destinations. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood DoS attacks. Also, consider correlating with network bandwidth and latency metrics to detect subtle flooding attempts.
