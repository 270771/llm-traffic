Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. There are no ICMP records or anomalies related to ICMP traffic in the provided data.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate TCP SYN flood or scanning activity if suspicious due to many S0 states, by reviewing SYN packet rates and source IP behavior. Also, enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
