Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, and type 13 indicates Timestamp Requests, both benign or diagnostic in nature rather than attack vectors.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing ICMP Destination Unreachable or Timestamp traffic.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance.
