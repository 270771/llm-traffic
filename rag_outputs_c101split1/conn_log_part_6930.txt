Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.150.226 to destination 172.23.68.231, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic. Other ICMP entries have types 0, 1, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods. There is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, since no ping flood is detected, no immediate security response is required.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency from any source IP. If sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests appear, investigate for potential ping flood attacks.
