Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (here shown as "0" in the 7th field after source IP and port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not specifically indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed ICMP type and code information and monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.227.159.6 to the destination 64.28.179.92. Also, review other logs or network telemetry for signs of other ICMP-based attacks or network scanning activity.
