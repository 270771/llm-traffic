Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 185.203.151.33 to 163.45.32.17, with a single packet (count=1) and duration of about 3 seconds, which does not indicate flooding.  
- The other ICMP entry from 203.78.140.213 to 170.17.88.54 has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore not a ping flood.  
- No high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests is observed, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 traffic is related to network misconfigurations or other issues, as it may indicate routing problems or traceroute activity.
