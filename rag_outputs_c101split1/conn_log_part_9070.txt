Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 messages are typically related to network diagnostics or routing issues, not attacks.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP Time Exceeded messages are observed from these IPs, as it may indicate routing loops or misconfigurations rather than an attack. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
