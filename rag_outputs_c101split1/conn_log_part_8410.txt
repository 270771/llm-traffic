Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.157.221 to destination 163.84.73.84, with a single packet and normal timing (0.000158 seconds). The other ICMP entries have type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from any source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP-based DoS attacks. Also, review other logs or network telemetry for signs of different attack types, such as ICMP unreachable messages (type 3) or other protocol anomalies.
