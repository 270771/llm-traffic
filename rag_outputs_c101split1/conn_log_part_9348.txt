Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Additionally, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060, which may indicate scanning or failed service attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP) for potential VoIP scanning or abuse. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for any ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood attempts are occurring.
