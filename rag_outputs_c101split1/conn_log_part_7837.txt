Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request, a necessary condition for ping flood detection. However, the log shows only two ICMP packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.18 and 133.105.230.16) with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and there is no evidence of sustained or overwhelming traffic.

No anomaly records are present to support suspicion of an attack. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the absence of volume or frequency patterns means this traffic does not match known ping flood heuristics, which generally involve high packet rates targeting a single or multiple hosts.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from this source IP. If volume spikes significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these isolated ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign scanning activity.
