Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field = tcp, last column = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood and suggests no ICMP-based attack is detected here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if such patterns emerge in other data sources.
