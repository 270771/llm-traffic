Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 151.235.214.242 to 202.125.201.8 with 224 bytes sent in 0.888860 seconds, and from 61.90.47.145 to 133.105.65.241 with 64 bytes sent in 5.012976 seconds.  
- The volume and frequency of these ICMP Echo Requests do not indicate a flood pattern (i.e., no rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame).  
- The other ICMP traffic (type 11) is unrelated to ping floods as it is not type 8.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 traffic (Time Exceeded) is related to other network issues or reconnaissance.
