Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic between two IPv6 addresses with ICMP type indicated as 128 (the last field), which corresponds to an ICMPv6 Echo Request. However, the instruction states that only ICMP type 8 (ICMPv4 Echo Request) is considered for ping flood detection. Since this is ICMPv6 and type 128, it does not match the known ping flood pattern based on ICMP type 8.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state is OTH (other), and no flags or counts indicate flooding behavior.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMPv6 Echo Requests (type 128) over time, as ICMPv6 ping floods can also be a concern but are outside the current heuristic scope. Monitoring traffic volume and rate from the source IP (2001:b744:c5e1:bff6:ff9f:9c3f:39ed:b171) to the destination IP (2001:fcff:fa89:cc3f:ffe0:e7ed:e020:43fe) is recommended to detect potential ICMPv6-based DoS attacks.
