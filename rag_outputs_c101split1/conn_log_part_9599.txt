Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only type relevant for ping floods. These two entries from source IP 54.254.197.94 to different destination IPs (163.45.176.42 and 163.45.193.2) have ICMP type 8, but the volume and frequency in this snippet are very low (only two requests within the timeframe). The other ICMP entries have types other than 8, which do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests means this traffic does not match typical ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets aimed at overwhelming a target.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other sources. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify any deviations in ICMP traffic patterns.
