Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP traffic, especially with type 8 (Echo Request), is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The entries mostly show SYN packets (S0 state) for TCP and some UDP traffic, which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs to capture Echo Requests and Replies.
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods.
- Review TCP SYN flood or UDP flood heuristics if connection attempts spike abnormally.
