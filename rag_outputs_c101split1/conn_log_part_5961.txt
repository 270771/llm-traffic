Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type values mostly 0, 3, 8, and 13. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the entries with type 8 are sparse and do not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (0, 3, 13) represent echo reply, destination unreachable, and timestamp request respectively, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would focus on high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 13 (timestamp request) traffic for potential network issues or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
