Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. While two entries have type 8, the volume and pattern do not indicate floodingâ€”there are only single isolated ICMP Echo Requests with no rapid repetition or high packet count. The third entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 109.5.240.144 and 143.5.202.233 for unusual ICMP activity patterns.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
