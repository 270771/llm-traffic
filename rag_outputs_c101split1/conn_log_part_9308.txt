Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 100.84.99.85 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination," and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 100.84.99.85 (receiving all ICMP Echo Requests)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.153.41, 133.227.204.1, 133.227.153.254, 133.227.223.248, 133.227.199.7, 133.227.223.249, 133.227.204.11, 133.227.152.254, 133.227.134.81, 133.227.152.57, 133.227.134.85, 133.227.220.6, 133.227.220.11  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 100.84.99.85.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
6. Ensure the target host has appropriate firewall rules to limit ICMP traffic and prevent resource exhaustion.
