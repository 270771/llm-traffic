Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0 or 1, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. The ICMP types observed here correspond to Echo Reply (type 0) and possibly other control messages (type 1), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard ICMP behavior, the absence of type 8 packets excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity, as multiple ICMP packets with type 0 or 1 could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
