Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- The connections show mostly SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.
- The observed traffic could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity, which aligns with heuristic categories related to network scanning rather than flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.144, 89.247.69.146) for potential scanning behavior.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.
