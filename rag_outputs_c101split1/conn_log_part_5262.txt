Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or Zeek icmp.log to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are occurring at high volume.  
- Monitor for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as many connections show SYN sent but no completion (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood detection if available, since the current traffic shows many incomplete TCP handshakes.
