Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the logs indicate only two isolated ICMP packets sent from 151.105.96.5 to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.122 and 133.105.230.120) with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet counts are minimal (1 each), which does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by a large number of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of volume and frequency, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, consider investigating if these isolated pings are part of network scanning or reconnaissance activities.
