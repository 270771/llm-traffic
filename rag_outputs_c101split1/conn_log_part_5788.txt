Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry from 202.250.230.253 to 64.190.198.223 has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry from 157.206.9.6 to 42.108.139.144 has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request logged, not a high volume or flood of such packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a large number of ICMP echo requests (type 8) in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential ping flood attempts. Investigate the source IP 157.206.9.6 if multiple echo requests appear in subsequent logs.
