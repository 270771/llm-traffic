Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are OTH (other) and the packet counts are very low (1 packet each), with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. A ping flood attack requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the low volume and lack of repeated traffic, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign scanning activity.
