Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 1 and 3 (destination unreachable and destination unreachable, respectively), not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP types 1 and 3 indicate error messages or unreachable hosts, which are normal network behaviors or could indicate network issues but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP unreachable messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
