Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none explicitly indicate ICMP traffic.
- The protocol field is either "udp" or "tcp"; ICMP traffic would be indicated differently and would include ICMP type information.
- The ICMP type is not present in these records, and no entries show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) and various TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) suggest scanning or other connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- Typically, ping flood attacks fall under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP Echo Request floods.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or abuse.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable logging or capture of ICMP-specific fields to improve detection accuracy.
