Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) from or to these IPs in other logs. Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP echo requests that could indicate scanning or flooding activity.
