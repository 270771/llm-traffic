Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have ICMP type 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. The traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP type 3, it may indicate network issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are routing or firewall issues causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
