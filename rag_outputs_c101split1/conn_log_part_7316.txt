Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values observed in the conn.log snippet are mostly 11 (Time Exceeded), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 8 (Echo Request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination that would indicate a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 and 11) are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. The absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 113.148.144.96 sending the single ICMP type 8 packet to 163.45.125.244 to confirm normal ping behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Review other logs or network traffic for signs of other ICMP-based attacks or network issues related to ICMP types 3 and 11.
