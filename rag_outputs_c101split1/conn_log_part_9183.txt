Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are either TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic shown (e.g., source port 5136 to destination port 5060) does not correspond to ICMP and thus cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.
- The TCP entries show typical connection attempts with SYN flags but no flooding pattern or ICMP involvement.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- Typically, ping flood detection relies on ICMP Echo Request volume and type, which is absent here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm no ping flood.
- Monitor for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates or other ICMP types.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
