Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The single ICMP-related field present (value 8 in one record) is part of a TCP connection record and does not indicate ICMP traffic. Therefore, no ping flood pattern is observed.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to rule out stealthy ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
