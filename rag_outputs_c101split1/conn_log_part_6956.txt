Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values shown are 3, 8, 11, etc., but only one entry has type 3 and none have type 8. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets further, as these may indicate network scanning, misconfigurations, or other network issues. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or unusually high ICMP traffic volume would be prudent to detect future ping floods.
