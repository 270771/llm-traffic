Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks. Establish heuristics for SYN scan detection and monitor for ICMP Echo Request floods explicitly.
