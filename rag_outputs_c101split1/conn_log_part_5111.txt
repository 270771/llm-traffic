Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.
- The lack of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next Steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP traffic logs are available separately, as Zeek may log ICMP in a different log file (icmp.log).
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies if available.
