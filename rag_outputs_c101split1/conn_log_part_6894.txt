Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or network path issues, this traffic may warrant investigation for network misconfigurations or routing loops, but it is not indicative of a ping flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from these IPs. If such patterns emerge, apply relevant heuristics for ICMP flood detection.
