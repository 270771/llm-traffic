Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic shown in the Zeek conn.log snippet has ICMP type values of 11 and 129, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and type 129 is an ICMPv6 Echo Reply, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure no routing loops or misconfigurations are causing excessive Time Exceeded packets.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
