Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.124.169, 157.206.142.60, 157.206.59.172, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (3.197.247.113) within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts simultaneously flood a target with echo requests to overwhelm it.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources in the 157.206.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.197.247.113 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 3.197.247.113.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor the target host for performance degradation and prepare mitigation such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing if attack volume escalates.
