Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.239, but there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping flood attempts. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Echo Reply) traffic for possible network issues or other anomalies.
