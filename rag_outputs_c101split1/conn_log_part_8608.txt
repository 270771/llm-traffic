Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to consider traffic as a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - 103.42.57.68 → 133.105.24.120  
  - 88.19.226.253 → 203.78.135.92  
- However, these entries show only a single or very low count of packets (1 packet each), not the high volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 128) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, ping flood would fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flood or DoS attacks and taxonomy class "Denial of Service."

Next steps:  
- Investigate if these IPs generate increased ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window to confirm or rule out slow-rate ICMP scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume from these sources.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network scanning activities.
