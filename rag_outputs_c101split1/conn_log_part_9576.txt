Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, not ICMP flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a denial-of-service attack.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154, which may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Monitor TCP SYN floods or scanning attempts from IPs such as 89.247.69.153 and 92.38.54.20.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts explicitly.
