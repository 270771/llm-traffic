Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 133.243.206.29 to 104.105.225.3, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types are 10 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP in a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 10 and 13 packets if they persist or increase, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance activities.
