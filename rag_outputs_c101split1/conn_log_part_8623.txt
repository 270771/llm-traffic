Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013227.42x). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 157.206.236.250, 157.206.127.243, 133.243.139.249, 133.243.9.7, 130.187.37.32, etc., all targeting destination IP 163.84.73.84 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the traffic is ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 163.84.73.84.
2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood if they are confirmed malicious or unauthorized.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
4. Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation services if the volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.
5. Review and update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
