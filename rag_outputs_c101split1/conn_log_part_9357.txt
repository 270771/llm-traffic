Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.183.178.87, from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013232.969xxx to 1641013232.973xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target IP."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.183.178.87 (no port for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.34.197, 157.206.5.195, 157.206.117.25, 157.206.1.46, 157.206.55.131, and many others from the 157.206.x.x subnet.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.183.178.87.  
2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood at the firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
4. Engage with upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or mitigating the attack at a higher network level.  
5. Review and harden the target hostâ€™s ICMP handling policies, possibly disabling ICMP Echo Replies if not required.  
6. Document the incident and prepare for potential escalation if the attack persists or expands.
