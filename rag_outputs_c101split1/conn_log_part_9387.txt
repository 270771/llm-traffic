Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown in the Zeek conn.log snippet, but the ICMP traffic is indicated with a subtype of "3" in the source port field (which likely corresponds to ICMP type 3, Destination Unreachable). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood attack.
