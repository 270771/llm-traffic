Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3` for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 3 messages could be considered if network issues arise.
