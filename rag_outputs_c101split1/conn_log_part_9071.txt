Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 8 in the ICMP type fields (4th and 7th columns). Specifically:  
- The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second entry has ICMP type 3 as well.  

Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network errors or unreachable hosts, which is not an attack but could warrant investigation if frequent.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no misconfigurations or network issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods to detect potential ping flood attacks.
