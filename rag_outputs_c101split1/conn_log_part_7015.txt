Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "OTH" (other), which means the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack. The connection shows a single ICMP packet with no signs of flooding or repeated requests.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple similar entries over time to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP attacks. Also, verify if other ICMP types (e.g., type 3 or 11) are present that might indicate different network issues or attacks.
