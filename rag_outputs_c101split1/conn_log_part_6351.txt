Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `8`. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 is a "Time Exceeded" message, not a ping request.  
- The second entry with ICMP type 8 is a single Echo Request, but there is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 sending ICMP Echo Requests if volume increases.  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, establish baseline traffic patterns to detect anomalies in ICMP traffic volume.
