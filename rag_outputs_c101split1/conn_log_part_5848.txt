Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with ICMP type values 3, 11, and 8 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single ICMP type 8 record (from 172.23.68.231 to 163.45.40.39), which does not indicate a flood. The other two entries are ICMP types 3 (destination unreachable) and 11 (time exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Given the data, no ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attack is evident.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. If such patterns emerge, further investigation and application of heuristics related to ICMP flood detection should be applied.
