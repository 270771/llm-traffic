Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.192.28.218) from multiple distinct source IPs within the same second (timestamp 1641013211.75xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.130.123, 133.243.65.1, 133.243.68.127, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 3.192.28.218. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), port fields are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.243.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (3.192.28.218) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
