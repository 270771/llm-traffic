Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 11th column) is either missing or not equal to 8 in all records. Specifically, the entries have ICMP types 0, 1, and 3, none of which correspond to ICMP Echo Request (type 8), which is required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic for ping flood requires ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets at high volume.  
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages, as these may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
