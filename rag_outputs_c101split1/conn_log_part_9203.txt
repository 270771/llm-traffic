Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field indicated by the port field (11), but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm the target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be ICMP packets of other types (possibly error or informational messages), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP types involved by capturing full packet details to confirm the ICMP type codes.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or high packet rates from the same source IPs, which could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Apply standard ICMP traffic monitoring heuristics once available to detect anomalies in ICMP traffic volume or patterns.
