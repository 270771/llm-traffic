Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `13`, not `8`. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp Request) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match the ICMP Echo Request pattern, it does not fit the ping flood heuristic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs (203.78.142.10, 91.194.95.148, 157.206.15.80, 120.75.231.41) for unusual ICMP error or timestamp request activity, as these could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If ICMP type 3 or 13 traffic volume spikes abnormally, consider further analysis for network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based attacks.
