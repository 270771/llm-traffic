Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to "Time Exceeded" (type 11) and "Destination Unreachable" (type 3), which may indicate network issues or traceroute activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of misconfigurations or other network problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
