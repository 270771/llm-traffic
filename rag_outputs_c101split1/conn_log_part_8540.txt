Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP record shows no ICMP type specified (field is "-"), so it cannot be a ping request (type 8). The second record shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply), not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomalies are recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo replies or other ICMP types unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) in other logs or timeframes.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic rates or patterns that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks.  
- If suspicious activity arises, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
