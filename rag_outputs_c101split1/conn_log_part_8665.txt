Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP connections (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate ping traffic. Since the condition for a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- The lack of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood heuristics, which typically focus on ICMP Echo Request floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of SYN connection attempts with no completion (S0 state) for possible TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP-based attacks occur outside this snippet.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules for TCP SYN scans and monitor for unusual connection patterns.
