Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 3 messages are being generated between 157.206.252.137 and 218.37.7.70, as frequent Destination Unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
