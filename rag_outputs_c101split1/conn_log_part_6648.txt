Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 13, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 11 and 13 are typically related to network diagnostics or routing issues rather than attacks.

Next steps: Investigate why these ICMP Time Exceeded and Timestamp messages are presentâ€”this could indicate routing loops or misconfigurations. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
