Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.236.220.60  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.129.71, 163.45.21.182, 163.45.171.20, 163.45.164.178, 163.45.52.83, and others in the 163.45.x.x range.  
- ICMP protocol, no ports involved (ICMP does not use ports).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.236.220.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for additional sources exhibiting similar behavior.  
3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting on internal routers to mitigate impact.  
5. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.  
6. Consider deploying anomaly-based detection rules to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
