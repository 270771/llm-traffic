Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 1 and 13, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 1 is an Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, neither of which indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.
- The connection states are OTH (other), with no signs of flooding or abnormal volume in the snippet.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the ping flood heuristic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.169 and 133.243.229.91) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other anomalous traffic patterns.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential other types of ICMP-based attacks or network scanning.
