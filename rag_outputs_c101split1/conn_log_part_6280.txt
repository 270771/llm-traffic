Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP types in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. The ICMP types observed are 0, 3, 10, and 13, corresponding to Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, Router Advertisement, and Timestamp, respectively. None of these indicate a flood of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack classifications.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or volumes of other ICMP types, especially type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which can indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to identify if other attack vectors are in play.
