Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) all targeting a single destination IP (54.129.195.3) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 130.187.x.x subnet (e.g., 130.187.19.214, 130.187.49.8, 130.187.193.94, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.129.195.3. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.129.195.3.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse, as the distributed nature suggests a coordinated attack or botnet.
  3. Enable ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on firewalls and intrusion prevention systems.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and prepare to escalate to upstream providers if attack volume increases.
