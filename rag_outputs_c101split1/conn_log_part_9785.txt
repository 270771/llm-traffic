Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (13.24.95.251) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013235.42-0.43). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid, repeated sending of ICMP Echo Requests to many different hosts is characteristic of a ping flood attack pattern, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 13.24.95.251  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.247.47, 163.45.24.184, 163.45.24.235, 163.45.198.246, 163.45.108.102, 163.45.207.6, 163.45.108.111, 163.45.198.253, 163.45.198.254, 163.45.247.62, 163.45.108.104, 163.45.78.239, 163.45.78.216, 163.45.205.41, 163.45.78.250, 163.45.205.2, 163.45.40.121, 163.45.205.64, 163.45.254.38, 163.45.40.227, 163.45.22.141  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.24.95.251 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts or other DoS vectors from this or related IPs.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate-based anomaly detection or blackhole routing for affected subnets.  
5. Review and update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and prevent similar ICMP flood patterns proactively.
