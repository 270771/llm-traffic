Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) or unspecified, but neither shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 means these packets are not part of a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) could indicate traceroute or routing issues, which is not inherently malicious but may warrant network health checks.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.243.19.169 and 203.78.140.213) for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
