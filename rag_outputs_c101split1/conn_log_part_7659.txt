Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is not composed of ICMP Echo Requests, it does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs to rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving these IPs (151.105.96.5 and 133.105.230.140).
