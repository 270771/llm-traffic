Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 0, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the basis for ping floods.  
- Type 1 is ICMP Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no known suspicious patterns are matched here.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic for unusual volumes of type 8 packets (Echo Requests) is recommended as a next step to detect potential future ping floods.
