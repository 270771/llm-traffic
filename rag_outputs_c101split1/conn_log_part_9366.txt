Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- These requests originate from many distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.156.19, 157.206.155.181, 157.206.155.131, etc.) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 69.232.166.26 and 54.183.178.87).
- The connections occur within the same second (timestamp 1641013233), indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context requires assigning a likely heuristic and taxonomy:
  - Heuristic: ICMP Flood Detection (commonly heuristic #3 in many IDS taxonomies).
  - Taxonomy: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack class.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple hosts in the 157.206.x.x range.
- Destination IPs: 69.232.166.26 and 54.183.178.87.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16).
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if not required for legitimate operations.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
