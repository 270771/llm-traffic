Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Multiple packets originate from the IP 3.241.1.60 targeting many different destination IPs (163.45.x.x range) in rapid succession (timestamps within milliseconds).
- The volume and distribution of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations in a short time frame matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: ICMP Flood Detection**.
- The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 3.241.1.60 (source port 8, ICMP Echo Request)
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x subnet (e.g., 163.45.124.108, 163.45.91.217, 163.45.1.96, etc.)
- ICMP protocol, no ports in the traditional TCP/UDP sense, but ICMP type 8 is key.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from 3.241.1.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Block or throttle ICMP traffic from the identified attacker IP to prevent network congestion and service disruption.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood sources and patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise of 3.241.1.60.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems and enable alerting for similar patterns.
- If possible, coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic from the attacker IP.
