Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 163.45.108.104 to destination 104.236.152.251, but it shows a single connection with a duration of about 2 seconds and only 60 bytes transferred, which does not indicate a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known suspicious patterns or classifications apply here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.45.108.104 if it starts generating multiple ICMP Echo Requests rapidly.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or ICMP traffic inspection on network devices to detect and mitigate potential future ping floods.
