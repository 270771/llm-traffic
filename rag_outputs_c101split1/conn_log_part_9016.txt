Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
Multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) are targeting the same destination IP 54.196.70.79 from different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.196.70.79 (ICMP type 8, no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: 133.227.162.178, 133.227.115.249, 133.227.115.94, 133.227.115.69, 133.227.223.254, 133.227.135.106, 133.227.135.133

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.196.70.79.  
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or coordinated attacks.  
- Notify the network operations team to consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.  
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
