Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 3, 2, and 0, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

- ICMP type 3 = Destination Unreachable  
- ICMP type 2 = Unknown (rare, but not Echo Request)  
- ICMP type 0 = Echo Reply  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
