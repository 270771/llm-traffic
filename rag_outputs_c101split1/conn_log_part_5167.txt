Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal connection attempts or scans over TCP/UDP ports.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data specifically capturing ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates or spikes in ICMP traffic volume.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
