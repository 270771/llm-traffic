Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is the 4th column after source IP, which here are 11, 11, 3, 11). Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries show type 8, the traffic does not match the fundamental requirement for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP types 3 and 11 observed here (Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages respectively), as they may indicate network issues or other non-DoS related anomalies. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be necessary to detect a ping flood in the future.
