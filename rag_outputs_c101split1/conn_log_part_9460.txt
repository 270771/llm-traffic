Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 1, 0, and 129, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP types seen (1 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply, 129 = ICMPv6 Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of other reconnaissance or error-based attacks. Monitoring for unusual volume or patterns in these ICMP types could be warranted.
