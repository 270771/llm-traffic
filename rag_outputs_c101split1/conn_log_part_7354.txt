Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows two entries with ICMP types 128 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

- ICMP type 128 corresponds to Echo Reply, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The traffic may indicate normal ICMP responses or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or patterns of ICMP error messages, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
- If available, enable logging or anomaly detection rules specifically targeting ICMP Echo Requests to catch ping floods early.
