Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The traffic consists mainly of TCP SYN attempts (flags S0, SF) and UDP packets on port 5060 (likely SIP signaling), none of which match ping flood characteristics.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed traffic patterns suggest possible scanning or reconnaissance activity (e.g., multiple TCP SYN attempts and UDP packets to SIP ports), which aligns with common network scanning heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated TCP SYN attempts and UDP packets on port 5060 for potential scanning or SIP-related abuse.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these connection attempts are benign or part of a broader attack pattern.
