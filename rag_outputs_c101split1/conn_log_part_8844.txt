Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" (the 7th field after source and destination IPs and ports), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 202.250.216.227 and 167.46.181.115 to determine if it corresponds to legitimate Echo Reply messages or another benign ICMP use case. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
