Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic rules out ping flood. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0) for possible TCP SYN scan or DoS attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging or review ICMP logs specifically to detect any ping flood activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if available, as these connection patterns may indicate other network reconnaissance or DoS activities.
