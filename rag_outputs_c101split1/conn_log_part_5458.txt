Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm no ICMP flood activity.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with S0 (SYN sent, no response) states, which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if such patterns emerge in future data.
