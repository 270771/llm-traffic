Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only entry with type 8 is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 202.101.173.197, but it appears as a single connection record without evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks fall under heuristics related to ICMP abuse and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 for unusual ICMP activity patterns over a longer time window.  
- Correlate with network bandwidth and latency metrics to identify possible DoS conditions.
