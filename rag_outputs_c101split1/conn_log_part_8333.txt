Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the timestamp and UID. For example, in the first entry, the ICMP type is `8`, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). Multiple entries from source IP `35.211.173.188` show ICMP type 8 targeting different destination IPs, which could indicate scanning or multiple pings but not necessarily flooding.  
- However, the volume and timing of these packets do not indicate a flood. The timestamps are very close but the number of packets is low and spread across different destination IPs, not a high-rate flood to a single target.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 0, 11) are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to support a ping flood classification. Without anomaly data or heuristics, no definitive attack labeling can be assigned.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and other ICMP messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume or rate of ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP, which would be more indicative of a ping flood.  
- Collect anomaly data and apply heuristics to detect abnormal ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP `35.211.173.188` for potential scanning behavior given multiple ICMP echo requests to different IPs.
