Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such event recorded, not a high volume or flood pattern. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. There is no evidence of repeated or excessive ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume anomalies.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ping flood activity. Also, review network device logs and traffic volume metrics for abnormal ICMP traffic patterns.
