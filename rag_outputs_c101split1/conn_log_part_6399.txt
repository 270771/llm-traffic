Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic between IPs, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided here. Since the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood and no such indication is present, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria. The connection state "OTH" and flags "F F" suggest these are incomplete or unusual connections but not necessarily ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of explicit ICMP type 8 and no anomalies, this traffic should be monitored but does not currently indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type details if available from other logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of this ICMP traffic. Also, review volume and frequency of ICMP packets from these IPs to detect potential flooding patterns not visible in this snippet.
