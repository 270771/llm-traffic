Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the safest conclusion is that this is normal ICMP diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps: Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages are part of legitimate network troubleshooting or if they indicate routing issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
