Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a destination port of 0 and no ICMP type field explicitly listed as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but is not sufficient to classify this as a ping flood or other attack without further data.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and frequency. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 81.170.245.74 to 203.78.143.78 to rule out emerging ping flood activity.
