Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3, 11, or 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages.  
- ICMP type 11 indicates Time Exceeded messages.  
- ICMP type 0 indicates Echo Reply messages.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or traceroute-like activity rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out misconfigurations or other network problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
