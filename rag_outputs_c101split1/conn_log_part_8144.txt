Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is not visible in this snippet.
- All connections show TCP flags and ports, no ICMP type or code fields are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (e.g., icmp.log) to confirm if ICMP Echo Requests are present.
- Monitor for unusual high-rate ICMP traffic from any IPs.
- If anomalies appear in ICMP traffic, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests; taxonomy class: DoS/ DDoS).

No current heuristic or taxonomy applies based on the given data.
