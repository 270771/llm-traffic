Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but there is only a single packet logged, not a flood or high volume of requests. The second record is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. No repeated or excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination are present to indicate flooding.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency or volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
