Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has types 128 and 133, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be other ICMP message types, possibly related to network management or other protocols, not indicative of an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of ICMP types 128 and 133 in this environment to ensure they are expected (e.g., router advertisements or other control messages). Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
