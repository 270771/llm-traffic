Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if additional logs show a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other protocol anomalies that might indicate different attack types.
