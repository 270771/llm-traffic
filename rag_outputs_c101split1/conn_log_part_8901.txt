Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.197.32.252, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources in the 133.227.x.x range (e.g., 133.227.243.254, 133.227.96.148, 133.227.139.189, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.197.32.252 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 54.197.32.252.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or peers to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking IPs.
- Monitor for collateral effects and ensure legitimate ICMP traffic is not unduly blocked.
