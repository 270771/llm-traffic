Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (here shown as "0" after the destination port field). For an ICMP ping flood, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is 0, this traffic does not represent an ICMP Echo Request and therefore is not a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the exact ICMP type and code. Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or patterns that may indicate other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
