Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (field 4 and 7 are both "3"), which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 3 messages is unusually high, which could indicate network issues or other ICMP-based reconnaissance. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
