Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an atypical or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP `120.85.185.26` and destination IP `203.78.132.112` for other suspicious activity, especially if multiple ICMP types or unusual traffic volumes are observed. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other signs of denial-of-service attempts.
