Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type values of 2 and 1 (fields before the ICMP length), which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP types observed correspond to "Destination Unreachable" (type 3) or "Echo Reply" (type 0), but here the exact types are 1 and 2, which correspond to "ICMP Unreachable" or "ICMP Redirect" messages, indicating other network conditions rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues, but no immediate ping flood response is required. If high volumes of these ICMP types persist, consider monitoring for ICMP-based reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse.
