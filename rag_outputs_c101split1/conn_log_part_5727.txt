Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 11, 13, and 1. According to the criteria, a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). None of the entries show ICMP type 8, so this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 11 = Time Exceeded  
- ICMP type 13 = Timestamp Request  
- ICMP type 1 = Echo Reply  

These types indicate other ICMP activity but not a ping flood. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for unusual ICMP activity patterns, especially if these ICMP types are frequent or unexpected in your environment.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Consider enabling detailed ICMP logging or alerting on high ICMP packet rates for early detection.
