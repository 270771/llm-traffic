Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry has type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an initiating ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source flooding a target.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 and 0 traffic is normal diagnostic traffic and does not indicate an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types if they appear.
