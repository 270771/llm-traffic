Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.66.123, 133.243.8.142, 133.243.15.6, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 174.95.41.114 in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts simultaneously send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources in the 133.243.x.x range targeting destination 174.95.41.114 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 174.95.41.114.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.243.0.0/16 if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
