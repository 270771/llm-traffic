Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the snippet shows two entries with ICMP protocol, but the ICMP type is not explicitly given as 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.  
- The first entry has no packet count or byte count indicative of flooding (all zeros). The second entry shows 1 packet of 56 bytes, which is a single ICMP packet, not a flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. However, the presence of ICMP traffic with OTH (other) state and no further anomalies suggests normal or benign ICMP activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection rules that specifically track ICMP Echo Requests and their frequency.  
- Investigate if any other logs or alerts indicate suspicious ICMP behavior.
