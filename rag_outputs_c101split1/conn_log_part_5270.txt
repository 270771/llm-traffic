Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic and anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as its absence here prevents detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as many connections show SYN_SENT (S0) states, which could indicate scanning or connection attempts worth further analysis.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood detection if available, as these connection attempts might represent a different attack vector.
