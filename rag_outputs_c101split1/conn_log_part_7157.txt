Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the TCP SYN packets with S0 flags (indicating connection attempts without completion) for possible TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with other network data sources to confirm if any volumetric ICMP traffic is occurring outside this snippet.
