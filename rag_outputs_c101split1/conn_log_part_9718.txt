Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), which may indicate an incomplete or unusual connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (157.206.120.171) or to the destination (3.39.157.141) over a longer time window to rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that could indicate different network reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
