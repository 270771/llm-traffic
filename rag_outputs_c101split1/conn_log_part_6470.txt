Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate a ping flood attack. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP Echo Replies alone does not constitute an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 202.250.230.253 or to the destination 189.63.118.97 in other logs to rule out ping flood attempts. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other protocol anomalies.
