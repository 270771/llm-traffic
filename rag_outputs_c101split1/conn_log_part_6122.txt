Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 13 and 1, but none with ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. ICMP type 13 corresponds to timestamp requests, and type 1 corresponds to destination unreachable messages, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomalies are recorded and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source and frequency of ICMP type 13 and 1 messages to ensure they are not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual ICMP traffic volume that could indicate evolving attack behavior.
