Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood attempts. Also, enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture relevant packet types for future analysis.
