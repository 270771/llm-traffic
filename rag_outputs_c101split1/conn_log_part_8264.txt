Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 1 (Destination Unreachable - Host Unreachable), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present, which are required for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP error messages rather than echo requests, this may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (157.206.4.55 and 133.105.128.252) for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If ICMP error messages persist at high volume, consider network troubleshooting or further packet-level analysis.
