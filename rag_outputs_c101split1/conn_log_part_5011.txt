Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is present except one entry:  
  `1641013247.890232 CQpQNU734PDvVO5jd 103.172.35.187 3932 202.250.249.246 5900 tcp - 1.625709 28 36 SF F F 64 ShAdDgaGFfr 8 356 9 404 - 6`  
- This entry is suspicious because it shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) but the protocol field is TCP, which is inconsistent and likely a logging artifact or misinterpretation. No flood pattern (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets) is evident.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to support a ping flood detection.  
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or a surge in ICMP traffic, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, the default assumption is that ICMP type 8 traffic alone is insufficient to label an attack without volume or pattern evidence.  
- The single ICMP type 8 record here does not indicate an attack but should be monitored.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 103.172.35.187 and destination 202.250.249.246 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window.  
- Verify logging accuracy for protocol and ICMP type fields to rule out data corruption.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate a developing ping flood.
