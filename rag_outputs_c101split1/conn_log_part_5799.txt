Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, a single or very limited number of echo requests do not constitute a ping flood. There is no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.45.198.141 sending ICMP Echo Requests to 163.45.220.14 to ensure it is legitimate traffic and not a precursor to an attack.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts for potential escalation.
