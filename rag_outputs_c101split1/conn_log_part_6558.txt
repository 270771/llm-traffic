Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The observed ICMP type 3 traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.4.35 and destination IP 103.1.80.48 for potential misconfigurations or reconnaissance behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
