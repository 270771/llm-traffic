Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic often relates to traceroute or network path issues rather than flooding attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 messages (62.131.23.137, 202.250.202.133, 38.171.171.231) to ensure these are legitimate network diagnostics and not part of a reconnaissance or other suspicious activity. Monitoring for unusual volume or patterns of ICMP type 11 could be useful.
