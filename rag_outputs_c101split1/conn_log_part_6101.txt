Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages. These do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable messages, as they may indicate routing issues or network misconfigurations rather than an attack. Monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
