Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have a type field value of 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack, no immediate threat is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.140.213 and 133.227.159.6) for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages, but no security incident related to ping flooding is present.
