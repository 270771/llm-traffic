Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.202.241.89 from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013210.92x). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is a high-frequency ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in typical DDoS detection taxonomies).
- The taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under network-based denial-of-service attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.227.x.x subnet are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.202.241.89. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 44.202.241.89 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation service to filter or absorb the flood traffic.
  4. Conduct a network-wide review to identify if these source IPs are compromised or spoofed and take remediation actions.
  5. Enable logging and alerting for continued or escalated ICMP flood activity.
