Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP type 3 traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are misconfigurations or other network problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
