Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-", which means we cannot confirm that the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type details in more complete logs to verify the nature of the ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for high volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or anomalies, such as ICMP unreachable or redirect messages, if ICMP type data becomes available.
