Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping flood detection. However, the first entry with ICMP type 8 shows only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in ICMP traffic volume.  
- If anomalies appear, assign heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/Disruption" as a standard for ping flood attacks.
