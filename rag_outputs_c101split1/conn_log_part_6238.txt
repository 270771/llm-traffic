Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 0, 1, or 3, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 1 (ICMP Echo Reply), none of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts unrelated to ping floods. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect future ping flood attempts.
