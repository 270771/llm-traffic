Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `3` (destination unreachable), not `8` (echo request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an irregular or incomplete connection, but not a flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 traffic could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.194.249 and destination IP 185.163.242.180 for repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is a network issue or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood.
