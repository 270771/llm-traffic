Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, the condition for identifying a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other types of attacks.
- The traffic shows multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed TCP SYN attempts could align with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically labeled as "Heuristic 1: Port Scanning" and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance."
- Further investigation should focus on the high volume of SYN attempts from IPs like 89.247.69.146 and 89.247.69.153 to multiple destination ports, which may indicate scanning activity.

Next Steps:
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to confirm the absence of ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for SYN flood or scanning patterns and correlate with IDS alerts.
- Implement rate limiting or blocking for suspicious IPs exhibiting repeated SYN attempts.
