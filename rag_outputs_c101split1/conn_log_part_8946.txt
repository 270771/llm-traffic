Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is "3," which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual or incomplete connection, which may warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages between 202.250.197.15 and 89.247.69.190 to determine if there are network misconfigurations or other issues causing these unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic or other suspicious activity.
