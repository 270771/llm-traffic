Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the lack of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood and suggests no related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeekâ€™s conn.log may not fully capture ICMP flows unless configured.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for other attack types such as TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, which may be indicated by the many TCP S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags seen here, suggesting possible scanning or connection attempts but not ping floods.
