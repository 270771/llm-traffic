Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 3, 13, and 128, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages.  
- ICMP type 13 indicates Timestamp Requests.  
- ICMP type 128 indicates Echo Replies.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfiguration, especially since ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp Request) can indicate network scanning or probing activity.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- If high volumes of ICMP type 3 or 13 persist, consider applying rate limiting or further network segmentation to mitigate potential reconnaissance.
