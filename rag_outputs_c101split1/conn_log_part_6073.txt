Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 3, or 11, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, both of which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect potential future ping floods.
