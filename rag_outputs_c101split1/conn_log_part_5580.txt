Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none explicitly indicate ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The protocol field shows mostly TCP (protocol 6) and UDP (protocol 17) traffic; no ICMP protocol (protocol 1) entries are present.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP type fields are logged.
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- If ICMP traffic is detected later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and taxonomy class “Denial of Service” (DoS).

No current heuristic or taxonomy applies based on the given data.
