Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign labels. Given the data, no attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a potential ping flood. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 messages to understand if there are network issues causing unreachable destinations.
