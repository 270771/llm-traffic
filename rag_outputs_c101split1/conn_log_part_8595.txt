Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has type 128 (indicated by the Zeek conn.log ICMP type field being 128), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, but not type 8 (ICMP Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns, no attack is present.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs showing high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic rates from the involved IPs (2001:b744:c5e1:6cfe:90:67d2:b6f2:7531 and 2001:fcff:fa80:b97:ffe1:e420:31e1:bfb8). Monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests and rate anomalies would be prudent.
