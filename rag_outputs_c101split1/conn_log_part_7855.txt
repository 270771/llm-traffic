Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 8, and 0. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood activity. Here, only two connections have ICMP type 8, but both have zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual echo request traffic. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of traffic volume and the presence of other ICMP types suggest no ping flood or related DoS attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP Echo Requests have zero packetsâ€”this could be benign or a logging artifact.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request packet counts or sustained high volume from any IP, which would warrant re-evaluation for ping flood.  
- Check for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP error messages (type 3) that might indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
