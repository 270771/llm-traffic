Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 corresponds to "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are control messages, not echo requests used in ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume that could indicate a developing ping flood.
