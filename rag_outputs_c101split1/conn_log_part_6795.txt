Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 11, 8, and 3 respectively. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood traffic. Here, only one entry has type 8 (from 45.225.96.135 to 133.105.104.7), but it is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from 45.225.96.135 to 133.105.104.7 over a longer time window to confirm or rule out flooding behavior.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests with short intervals and high packet counts.  
- Check for other signs of DoS activity or network degradation related to these IPs.
