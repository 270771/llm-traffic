Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) or unspecified, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. The traffic shows isolated ICMP packets without a high volume or repeated Echo Requests from one source to a destination, which does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or related ICMP-based DoS attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets or unusually high ICMP traffic volume. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from single IPs to detect potential ping floods early.
