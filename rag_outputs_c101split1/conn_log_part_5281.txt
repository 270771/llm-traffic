Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated in the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with flags like S0 (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. Typically, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ DDoS" for ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP type fields are logged.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific Zeek logs (icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources.
