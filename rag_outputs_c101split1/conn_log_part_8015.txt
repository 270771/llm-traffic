Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections targeting a single destination IP (107.102.62.64) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). Multiple distinct source IPs from the 157.206.x.x subnet are sending these requests in rapid succession within the same second (timestamp 1641013222.17xxxx), consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern. The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests to one target strongly indicate a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 107.102.62.64 (ICMP has no ports, but destination port field is 8 indicating ICMP type)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.34.198, 157.206.168.246, 157.206.0.173, 157.206.80.28, and many others in the 157.206.0.0/16 range.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16) targeting 107.102.62.64.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.  
4. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack impact.  
5. Alert incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or abuse of the source IPs involved.
