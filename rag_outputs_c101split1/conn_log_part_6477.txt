Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show type 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request" messages, not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which relies on a high volume of ICMP echo requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP type 13, it may be normal network diagnostic activity or a different ICMP-based behavior, but it is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated echo requests from the same source IPs. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood attacks.
