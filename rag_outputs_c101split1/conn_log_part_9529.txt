Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show UDP or TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- The ICMP type field is absent or not indicated as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks.
- The traffic mostly involves UDP port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP ports, none matching ICMP ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are clearly indicated, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs, as this could indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.
