Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood mitigation. However, further investigation into the cause of ICMP type 11 messages between 133.227.58.122 and 180.187.124.104 is recommended to rule out misconfigurations or other network anomalies.
