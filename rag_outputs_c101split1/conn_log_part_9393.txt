Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.39.157.141 from numerous distinct source IPs within the same timestamp. This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack. The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, which aligns with the known behavior of ping floods.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the observed behavior fits the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled under a taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood / DoS Attack." Assigning heuristic number 1 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" is appropriate here.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.39.157.141 (ICMP has no ports)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.167.242, 157.206.147.11, 157.206.172.135, 157.206.200.248, 157.206.148.81, and others in the 157.206.x.x range.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.39.157.141.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and potentially block or quarantine the attacking source IPs.  
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.  
5. Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
