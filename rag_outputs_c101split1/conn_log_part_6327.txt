Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 4th field after the source IP (e.g., the value "3", "11", "8" in the examples). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. However, this single echo request does not indicate flooding by itself. The other entries have ICMP types 3 and 11, which correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, not ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, heuristic for ping flood would involve high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window or from multiple sources to the same destination. Monitor for repeated echo requests and increased ICMP traffic volume to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
