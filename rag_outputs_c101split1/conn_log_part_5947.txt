Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single instance with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ICMP type 8 traffic alone is normal ping activity, not an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a potential ping flood. Investigate if any other logs show sustained ICMP echo requests or abnormal traffic volume.
