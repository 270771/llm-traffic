Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (54.254.197.94) sending numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) to multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.008 seconds per connection). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets to many targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm network resources by saturating them with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations in a short time." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.254.197.94; multiple destination IPs include 163.45.71.249, 163.45.232.193, 163.45.152.2, 163.45.143.250, 163.45.190.30, 163.45.117.201, 163.45.9.6, 163.45.207.6, 163.45.32.251, 163.45.18.206, 163.45.71.161, 163.45.117.182, 163.45.117.86, 163.45.9.77, 163.45.9.73. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.197.94 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential impact on affected hosts.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on routers.
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches the network.
