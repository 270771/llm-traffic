Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has type 8 only in two entries (from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.98 and 133.105.230.96), which corresponds to echo requests (pings). However, the volume is extremely low (only 1 packet each), and there is no indication of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood. The other ICMP entry has type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve high packet rates of ICMP type 8 from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review other logs or network telemetry for signs of denial-of-service activity.
