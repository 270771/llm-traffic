Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the ICMP type and connection state (OTH), this appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic with high frequency from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Further investigation should focus on traffic volume and ICMP type distribution.
