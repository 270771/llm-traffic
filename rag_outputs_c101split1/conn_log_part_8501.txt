Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3, 11, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 1 (Host Unreachable or other ICMP error messages) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
