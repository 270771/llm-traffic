Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 58.13.7.9 to 133.105.143.60, but there is only a single packet recorded (count=1). The other ICMP entries have types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods. A ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP traffic appears normal or related to network diagnostics/errors rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if they persist or increase, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
