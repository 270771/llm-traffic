Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.185 and destination IP 123.240.195.2 for unusual ICMP Time Exceeded message patterns or routing loops. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
