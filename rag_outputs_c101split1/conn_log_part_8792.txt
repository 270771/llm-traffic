Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates error messages rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP type, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.207.135 and destination 3.29.24.223 for potential network routing or firewall issues generating ICMP type 3 messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
