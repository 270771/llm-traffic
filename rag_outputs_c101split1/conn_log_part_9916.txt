Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries; all records are TCP or UDP.
- Even if ICMP were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a host.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The TCP and UDP connections mostly show SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics and taxonomy classes related to scanning or probing.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated SYN attempts from IP 121.214.24.114 to multiple destination IPs and ports (e.g., 2375) for possible scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging and monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP/UDP traffic.
