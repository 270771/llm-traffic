Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and presence of many TCP connection attempts with S0 flags (SYN sent, no response) suggests possible TCP SYN scanning or connection attempts rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 flags for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity. Focus on IPs such as 89.247.69.* and 133.105.* which appear frequently. Correlate with IDS or firewall logs to confirm scanning behavior and consider blocking or rate-limiting suspicious sources.
