Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field values of 0 and 1 (the 6th and 16th fields in the snippet are 0 and 1, respectively), which are not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets (types 0 and 1 correspond to Echo Reply and possibly other control messages) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of another ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial attempt.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate an emerging ping flood.  
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to correlate with this traffic for deeper analysis.
