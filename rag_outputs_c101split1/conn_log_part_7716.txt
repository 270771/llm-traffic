Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. Specifically, IP 151.105.96.5 is sending repeated ICMP type 8 packets to different destination IPs (133.105.230.127 and 133.105.230.126) within milliseconds, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern. The rapid succession and multiple targets suggest an attempt to overwhelm the targets with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests" under the taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IP: 151.105.96.5 (sending ICMP type 8 packets)  
- Destination IPs: 133.105.230.127 and 133.105.230.126  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 151.105.96.5 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flooding attempts from this or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source host 151.105.96.5 for compromise or misuse.  
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar patterns in the future.  
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source is external and persistent.
