Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-", and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are indicated. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be generic ICMP with OTH (other) state, which could be unrelated or benign.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payload sizes.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal ICMP traffic volume that could indicate a developing ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.
