Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `1` for both entries, which corresponds to ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 1 traffic typically indicates network issues or unreachable hosts rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there is a network misconfiguration or routing problem. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
