Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP traffic with ICMP type fields indicated by the port numbers (3 and 10 for the first entry, 128 and 129 for the second). ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood, but here the types correspond to other ICMP message types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 10 = Router Advertisement, 128 = Echo Reply, 129 = Router Solicitation). Therefore, these are not ICMP Echo Requests and do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here. The traffic does not indicate a ping flood or any other clear attack pattern based on the given data.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP messages further if unusual volumes or patterns are observed, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted. Monitoring for actual ICMP type 8 traffic spikes is recommended.
