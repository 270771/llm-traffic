Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet corresponds to the 4th and 6th columns (source port and destination port) which here show values like 3, 11, and 1. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood, but none of these entries have type 8. Instead, the types appear to be 1 (Echo Reply), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.137.66, 203.78.140.213) for other suspicious activity since multiple ICMP error messages (type 3 and 11) are present, which could indicate network issues or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Establish heuristics to flag excessive ICMP Echo Requests if not already in place.
