Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). The second entry has ICMP type 3, which is a destination unreachable message, not related to ping floods. However, there is only a single ICMP echo request record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would require detection of a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 172.23.68.231 is sending multiple echo requests over a short time window.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts to detect potential flooding behavior.
