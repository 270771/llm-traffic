Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP connection attempts with SYN packets flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- If suspicious TCP SYN floods or scans are suspected, apply heuristics related to SYN flood or port scanning for further analysis.
