Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 35.87.78.209, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013211.008xxx to 1641013211.011xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 133.227.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.227.112.1, 133.227.199.11, 133.227.115.249, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.87.78.209 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.87.78.209.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact on the target host and ensure availability.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
