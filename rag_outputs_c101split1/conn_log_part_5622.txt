Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP traffic and no other suspicious indicators, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent legitimate traffic or another form of ICMP communication (e.g., Echo Reply or other ICMP types). Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic volume from these IPs would be prudent.
