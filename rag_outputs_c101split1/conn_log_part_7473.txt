Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 3, and 1. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request used in ping floods.  
- ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 1 is Host Unreachable or Destination Unreachable (depending on implementation). These indicate error or control messages, not ping requests.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) flooding a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, the presence of multiple ICMP error messages could indicate network issues or scanning activity worth investigating further.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP error messages to rule out misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for broader context.
