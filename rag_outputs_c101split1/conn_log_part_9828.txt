Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 13, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates a ping flood, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request," neither of which are used in ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 13 traffic may warrant further investigation into network issues or reconnaissance activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.132.118 and 133.227.130.250) for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for correlated suspicious activity.
