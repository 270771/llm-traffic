Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (54.236.220.60) sending numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) to multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007â€“0.009 seconds per connection). This pattern matches known ping flood behavior, where an attacker overwhelms targets with a high volume of ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in typical taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.236.220.60; multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range; ICMP type 8 (echo request) on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.236.220.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services if attack volume escalates.
