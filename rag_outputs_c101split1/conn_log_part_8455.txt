Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which indicate ping requests, are not present in the snippet. The ICMP types observed are 3, 10, and 2, none of which correspond to Echo Request (type 8).  
- ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable, type 10 is Router Advertisement, and type 2 is Echo Reply. These do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 and 10 messages, as excessive Destination Unreachable or Router Advertisement messages could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or network scanning once available.
