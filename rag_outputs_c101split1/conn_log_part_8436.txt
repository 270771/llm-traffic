Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such connection, not a flood or high volume of echo requests. The second entry is ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would be indicative of a ping flood. If such patterns emerge, investigate further and apply relevant heuristics for volumetric ICMP attacks.
