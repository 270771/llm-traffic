Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the destination port field (which is 0 here), but more importantly, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood. The log shows ICMP traffic with a port value of 0, which does not correspond to ICMP type 8. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the exact ICMP type and code fields. Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or other anomalies that might indicate different types of ICMP-based attacks or network issues.
