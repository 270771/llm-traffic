Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 13 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. ICMP type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request" and type 10 to "Router Advertisement," which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding or denial-of-service behavior by themselves.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of these ICMP messages over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfiguration issues. Also, monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
