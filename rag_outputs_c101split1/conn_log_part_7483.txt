Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to monitor for ICMP type 8 packets.  
- Monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that might indicate scanning or other TCP-based attacks, applying heuristics for SYN flood or port scanning if available.
