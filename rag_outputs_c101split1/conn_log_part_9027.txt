Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic is likely benign or related to network diagnostics rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 13 traffic between 157.206.133.125 and 90.54.179.70 to ensure it is expected behavior. Monitor for any increase in volume or changes in ICMP types that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks.
