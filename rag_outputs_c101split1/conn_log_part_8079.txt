Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8 and 128. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but the first record shows a single ICMP packet with type 8 and only 1 packet total, which does not indicate flooding. The second record shows ICMP type 128, which is an ICMPv6 Echo Request, but again only 58 packets total, which is not necessarily flooding without additional context such as high packet rate or volume.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior. Without evidence of a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame or other indicators, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. 

Next steps: Monitor for a sudden increase in ICMP Echo Request packet counts or rates from these IPs. Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity or if network performance issues correlate with this traffic.
