Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even the UDP entries (e.g., ports 123, 137) do not indicate ICMP traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
