Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting two distinct destination IPs: 44.195.45.212 and 3.203.247.100. The requests originate from numerous different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013223.59), indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests flooding these targets. This pattern matches the classic ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Targets: 44.195.45.212 and 3.203.247.100 (destination IPs)  
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.227.x.x and 133.243.x.x ranges (source IPs)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges targeting the victim IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to monitor for collateral impact and prepare for potential escalation.  
4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the most aggressive source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.  
5. Review upstream provider or ISP support for traffic filtering or mitigation services (e.g., DDoS protection).
