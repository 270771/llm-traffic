Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (commonly related to ICMP Echo Request floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as the current TCP SYN failures (S0 state) might indicate scanning or connection attempts but not flooding.  
- Enable or check ICMP logging to ensure visibility into ping-related traffic.
