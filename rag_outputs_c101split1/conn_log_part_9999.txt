Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and frequency in the snippet are very low (only two packets within milliseconds, packet sizes 72 and 30 bytes), which does not match the high-rate, sustained traffic pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Monitor for a significant increase in ICMP Echo Request packet rate from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs. If a surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign traffic.
