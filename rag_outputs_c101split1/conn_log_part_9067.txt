Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values of 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single entry with ICMP type 8 (from 68.191.145.105 to 203.78.135.92), but it is isolated and does not show the high volume or rapid repetition characteristic of a ping flood. The other entries with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet for normal network diagnostics or benign activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests that might indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Review other logs or anomaly data for signs of different attack types, such as ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service variants.
