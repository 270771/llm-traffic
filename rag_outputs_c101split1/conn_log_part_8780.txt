Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping traffic, these entries do not represent ping floods. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are control messages, not ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, no ping flood or related attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
