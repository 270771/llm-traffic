Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs or over time to rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for any unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving these IPs.
