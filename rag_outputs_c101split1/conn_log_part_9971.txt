Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are OTH (other) with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which are typical indicators of a ping flood. The logs show only single entries per source-destination pair without volume or rate data suggesting flooding.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 8 is present but no flooding pattern is detected, this traffic appears to be normal ping activity or isolated ICMP echo requests.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or ICMP traffic inspection on network devices to preemptively mitigate ping flood risks.
