Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged here, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show failed TCP handshakes (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060, which could suggest scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the S0 state typically corresponds to incomplete TCP connections, often linked to scanning heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP) from IP 45.121.95.154, as multiple entries show failed attempts. This could indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts and warrants further analysis. Also, monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
