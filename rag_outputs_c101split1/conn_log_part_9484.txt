Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from numerous distinct source IPs to a single destination IP (54.198.197.73) within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013233.57). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where an attacker overwhelms a target with a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic patterns for volumetric ICMP flood attacks (e.g., heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one IP) and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 133.227.156.132, 133.227.211.5, 133.243.206.29, 133.227.64.254, 133.227.157.54, 133.227.210.254, 133.227.160.249, 133.227.160.254, 133.227.179.0, 157.206.89.146, 133.227.181.244 targeting destination IP 54.198.197.73 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.198.197.73.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and prepare to apply blackhole routing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
- Notify affected stakeholders and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or outage.
