Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood. The entries are sparse and involve different source IPs targeting a single destination IP (47.201.192.242), but the count of packets per connection is 1, and there is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source or multiple sources in a short time frame that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood (ICMP flood) heuristic would involve detecting high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts indicating denial of service symptoms.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unexpected or unauthorized in the network context.
