Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 203.78.160.62, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for rate-based alerts on ICMP traffic.
