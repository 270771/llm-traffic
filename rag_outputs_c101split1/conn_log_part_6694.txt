Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3`, neither of which is `8` (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues.  
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network or host unreachable errors.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP packets, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving high packet rates of type 8 messages from a single source IP.
