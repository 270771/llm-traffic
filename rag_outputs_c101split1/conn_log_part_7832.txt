Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is necessary for ping floods, but the traffic volume and connection details do not indicate flooding. The logs show only single or very sparse ICMP echo requests without rapid repetition or high packet counts typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of volume and anomaly indicators, this traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs (163.45.108.104 and 151.105.96.5). If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
