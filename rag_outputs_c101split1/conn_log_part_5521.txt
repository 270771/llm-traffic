Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes apply.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs specifically for type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods. Also, review other protocol logs for signs of different attacks, as the current TCP connection attempts show many SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity worth further analysis.
