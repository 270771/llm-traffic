Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 11 or other than 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries show type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages seen here, as they may indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
