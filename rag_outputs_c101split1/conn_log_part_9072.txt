Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8, but they are isolated single packets with no evidence of rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination.  
- The third entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs (166.111.77.224 and 172.23.68.231) could be a prudent next step to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
