Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 8 (Echo Request). However, only one record has ICMP type 8, and it is a single connection from 172.23.68.231 to 203.78.206.217. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 11 packets suggests normal network diagnostic or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate the source 172.23.68.231 if it starts generating a large number of echo requests.
