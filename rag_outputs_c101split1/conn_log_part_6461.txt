Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 143.187.187.183 to 163.45.255.56, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics focus on high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate traffic volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from 143.187.187.183 to 163.45.255.56 over a longer time window to rule out low-rate or slow ping floods.  
- Monitor for any spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies.  
- Check for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that might indicate different network issues or attacks.
