Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types. The critical detail is that only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates a ping flood. Here, the entries with ICMP type 8 are:

- 18.75.223.59 → 202.250.204.126 (type 8)  
- 18.75.223.59 → 202.250.202.133 (type 8)

However, these connections have very low counts (last field is 1), and the durations and packet counts do not indicate a flood pattern (e.g., high packet rate or volume). The other entries have ICMP types 0 and 128, which are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Given the data, the traffic does not match a ping flood pattern, which would require sustained, high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.  
- If suspicious volume or patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood."

No immediate attack is present based on the current data.
