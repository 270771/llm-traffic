Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the 4th field after the source IP (which is `3` in all entries). ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" (ping). Since none of the entries show ICMP type 8, these are not ping requests and therefore do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 traffic typically indicates network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the repeated ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or scanning attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to determine if these ICMP unreachable messages are symptomatic of a larger network problem.
