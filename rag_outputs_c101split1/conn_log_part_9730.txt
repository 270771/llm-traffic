Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP traffic (type 11) may indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP `133.243.19.169` and destination IP `194.60.19.89` for unusual ICMP Time Exceeded message volumes or routing loops. Monitor for any escalation to ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
