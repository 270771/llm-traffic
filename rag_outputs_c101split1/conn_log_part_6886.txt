Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply), and the second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 packets and no other suspicious patterns, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 packets or unusually high ICMP traffic volume. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.
