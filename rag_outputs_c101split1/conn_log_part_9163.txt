Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-volume ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity related to ICMP or ping floods.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- Typically, ping flood heuristics focus on ICMP type 8 traffic volume and rate thresholds.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current logs.
