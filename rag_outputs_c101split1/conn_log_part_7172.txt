Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 133.243.113.177 to 23.149.180.131, but there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP types 11 and 3 suggests normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. If such patterns emerge, investigate the source IP for possible malicious activity.
