Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 1, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages.
- ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages.

These types indicate network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent to detect any future ping flood attempts.
