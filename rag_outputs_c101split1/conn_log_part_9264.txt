Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic must have type 8 (Echo Request) to be considered ping flood traffic. The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only UDP and TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses on port 5060 appears to be SIP signaling attempts or scanning, not ICMP Echo Requests.
- TCP connections show SYN attempts (S0 state) but no flooding pattern consistent with ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The observed UDP traffic on port 5060 may warrant investigation for SIP scanning or UDP flood, but this is distinct from ping flood.
- Typical heuristic for UDP flood or SIP scanning would be different (e.g., high volume of UDP packets to SIP ports), but no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is given here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 on multiple hosts for potential SIP scanning or UDP flood.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any alerts on UDP or TCP floods.
