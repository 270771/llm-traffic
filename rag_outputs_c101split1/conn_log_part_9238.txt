Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic consists mainly of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and UDP packets on port 5060, which may indicate scanning or SIP-related activity but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could relate to a heuristic for port scanning or SYN flood, but without further data, this is speculative.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP) may warrant investigation for SIP scanning or enumeration attacks.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 for potential SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture to confirm the presence or absence of ICMP-based attacks.
