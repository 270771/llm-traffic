Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 133.243.206.29 and 130.187.37.189, but the volume and frequency of these requests are very low (single packets each) and do not indicate a flood pattern. Other ICMP types present are not type 8, so they do not qualify as ping floods. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these low-volume ICMP packets were to be investigated further, next steps would include monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data.
