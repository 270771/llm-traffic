Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from the first entry:  
- Source IP: 203.78.143.78  
- Destination IP: 46.158.135.5  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Count: 1 packet (last field)  

The other entries show ICMP types 3 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods. Additionally, the volume of ICMP type 8 packets is very low (only 1 packet), which does not match the high-rate, repetitive ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. However, by standard definition, a ping flood requires multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) messages for potential network issues or other anomalies.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume from 203.78.143.78 to 46.158.135.5 that might indicate emerging ping flood activity.
