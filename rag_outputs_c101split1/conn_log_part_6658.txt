Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, there is only a single such event recorded, not a flood or high volume of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the limited data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 if it starts generating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for volume-based alerts.
