Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.39.157.141, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013233.17xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.39.157.141 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.50.154, 157.206.50.77, 157.206.153.118, 157.206.144.225, 157.206.211.153, 157.206.144.209, 157.206.80.9, 157.206.227.126, 157.206.236.111, 157.206.151.38, 157.206.229.128, 157.206.247.253, 157.206.4.253, 157.206.227.120, 157.206.195.38, 157.206.155.242, 157.206.11.151, 157.206.236.210, 157.206.80.10, 157.206.196.254, 157.206.113.99, 157.206.228.253  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none are applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.39.157.141.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host to reduce impact.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and take further mitigation steps accordingly.
