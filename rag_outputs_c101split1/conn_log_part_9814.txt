Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request), except one entry with type 0 (Echo Reply) and others with type 1 or 3. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) suggests possible network scanning or misconfiguration rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.137.66 for unusual ICMP error messages (types 1 and 3) which might indicate network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for broader context on suspicious activity.
