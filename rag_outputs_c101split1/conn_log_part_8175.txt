Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 44.195.45.212, from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013223.579 to 1641013223.585). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" often labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.  
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High volume ICMP Echo Request flood)  
- Taxonomy class: DoS/Disruption

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 44.195.45.212 (ICMP type 8, no ports)  
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.227.96.148, 133.227.206.254, 133.227.223.200, 133.227.182.253, 133.227.210.249, 133.227.160.255, 133.227.75.6, 133.227.184.0, 133.227.96.149, 133.227.187.100, 133.227.184.6, 133.227.184.1, 133.227.221.6, 133.227.206.249, 133.227.144.248, 133.227.96.135, 133.227.112.2, 133.227.144.254, 133.227.137.165, 133.227.182.244

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 44.195.45.212.  
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack closer to the source if possible.
