Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a response to a ping rather than the flood of requests typical in a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match ping flood patterns but could be part of normal network communication or a response to legitimate pings.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 119.255.136.125 or to the destination 163.45.236.140 in other logs to rule out a ping flood. Monitor for repeated or excessive ICMP Echo Requests to confirm or dismiss potential ICMP-based attacks.
