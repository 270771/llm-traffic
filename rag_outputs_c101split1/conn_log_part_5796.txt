Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Only one ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, it is a single connection entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which are characteristic of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded) or 0 (Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume anomalies.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or ICMP traffic inspection on network devices to detect and mitigate future ping floods.
