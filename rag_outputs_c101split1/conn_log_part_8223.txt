Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping packets. However, there is only a single ICMP Echo Request from 172.23.68.231 to 163.45.135.217, not a flood or high volume of such packets. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no sustained or repeated ICMP Echo Requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. If a surge in such packets occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks.
