Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 129, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 129 traffic (which corresponds to ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages) to ensure it is legitimate network management traffic and not part of a reconnaissance or other attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
