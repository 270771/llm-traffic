Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (54.236.220.60) sending numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) to multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007â€“0.009 seconds per connection). This pattern of high-rate ICMP echo requests to many targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / DoS Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.236.220.60; targets are multiple 163.45.x.x IPs (e.g., 163.45.151.144, 163.45.151.6, 163.45.222.237, etc.). ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.236.220.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Notify upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to assess impact and update incident response playbooks accordingly.
