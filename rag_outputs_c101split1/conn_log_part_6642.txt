Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 129, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP types observed correspond to Time Exceeded (type 11) and an undefined or non-standard type (129), which may indicate other network conditions or benign diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and purpose of ICMP type 11 messages, as they often relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, and verify the nature of ICMP type 129 traffic to rule out misconfigurations or other unusual activity. Monitoring for volume spikes or repeated patterns could help detect other types of ICMP-based attacks.
