Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" in the destination port column, but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is "OTH" (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to verify ICMP types and rates. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from 202.101.171.237 to 116.199.145.159 to detect potential ping floods.
