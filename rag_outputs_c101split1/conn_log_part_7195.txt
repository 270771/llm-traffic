Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the 7th column (protocol) and the 8th column (ICMP type). Here, the ICMP type values are either missing ("-") or "1" in the relevant entries, but none show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood.

Other observations:  
- The traffic includes ICMP packets with type 1 (which is typically "destination unreachable" or other control messages), not echo requests.  
- No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no other attack types can be confidently inferred.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.169, 202.250.230.254) for unusual ICMP control message patterns or other suspicious activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
