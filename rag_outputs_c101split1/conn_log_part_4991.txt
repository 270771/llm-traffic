Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for potential scanning activity due to repeated SYN attempts without completion.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP-based attacks occur.  
- Enable anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to detect ping floods explicitly.
