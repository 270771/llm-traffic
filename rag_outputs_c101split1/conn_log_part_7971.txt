Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 1 and 13, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the basis for ping flood attacks. Types 1 and 13 correspond to other ICMP message types (Type 1 = Destination Unreachable, Type 13 = Timestamp Request), which do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that only ICMP type 8 traffic with high volume and rapid frequency would indicate a ping flood. This is not observed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 and 13 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics or error messages and not part of another attack vector.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these IPs.  
- If anomalies arise, collect detailed flow data and apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection.
