Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the protocol number 11 and no type 8 specified), which corresponds to ICMP Echo Reply or other types, but not Echo Request (type 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs capturing ICMP Echo Requests or high-volume ICMP traffic. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns. If other attack types are suspected, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data.
