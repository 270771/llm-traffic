Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and echo reply (type 0), which may indicate normal network diagnostics or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior or repeated error messages that could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
