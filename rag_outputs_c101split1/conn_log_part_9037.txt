Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.31.62, 133.243.112.247, 133.243.162.52, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.241.41.56, 52.45.247.73, 34.27.172.201) in a very short time frame (all timestamps are within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a few destinations simultaneously is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single/few targets" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (commonly used for volumetric ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.243.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.243.31.62, 133.243.112.247, 133.243.162.52, etc.)
- Destination IPs: 54.241.41.56, 52.45.247.73, 34.27.172.201
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.243.0.0/16) targeting the affected destination IPs.
- Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical hosts if business operations allow.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
