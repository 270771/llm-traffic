Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is a single entry from 133.243.206.29 to 2.123.245.2. The other ICMP entries have type 1 (Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or other DoS attacks. Also, consider correlating with other logs or network metrics to detect volumetric anomalies.
