Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- The first two entries have ICMP type 8, but only single or very few packets are shown, not a flood or high-rate pattern.  
- The third entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or flooding patterns.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, no taxonomy class or heuristic number can be assigned. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs show other suspicious activity or if ICMP traffic volume increases significantly.  
- Enable rate-limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests if flooding is suspected in the future.
