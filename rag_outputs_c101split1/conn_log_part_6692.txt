Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values observed in the conn.log snippet are mostly 0, 1, 3, and 11. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, the traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

Other observations:  
- ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are present, which may indicate network issues or traceroute-like activity but not a ping flood.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and no high volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests are evident.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- No explicit heuristics or taxonomy data is available from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.  
- Typically, a ping flood heuristic would be based on high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to understand if there are underlying network problems or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
