Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 8th column after the timestamp and UID) is not 8 in either record. The first entry has ICMP type 1 (likely an ICMP error message such as "destination unreachable"), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (likely an echo reply). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly indicators, this traffic does not represent a ping flood or similar ICMP-based DoS attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.243.158.250 sending ICMP type 1 messages to 1.71.187.79 to ensure these are legitimate error messages and not indicative of network issues or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) or unusual ICMP traffic volume that could indicate emerging threats.
