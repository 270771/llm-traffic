Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first record shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are typically related to network diagnostics or error messages rather than flooding attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. However, these ICMP types could indicate network issues or misconfigurations worth investigating further.

Next steps: Review network device logs and routing configurations to understand the cause of these ICMP error messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
