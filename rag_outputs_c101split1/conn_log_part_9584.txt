Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x subnet. This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets to many hosts is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm network resources by saturating them with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.197.94; Destination IPs include 163.45.58.158, 163.45.21.83, 163.45.181.247, 163.45.21.233, 163.45.21.199, 163.45.58.68, 163.45.108.111, 163.45.181.250, and others in the 163.45.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8 (echo request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.254.197.94 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts or other suspicious activity from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate-based anomaly detection or blackhole routing for persistent offenders.
