Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 172.23.68.231 to two different destination IPs (163.45.223.5 and 163.45.28.153). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a floodâ€”only two ICMP echo requests are logged, which is insufficient to classify as a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entry with type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods, as only ICMP type 8 is relevant for such attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to high ICMP echo request rates.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood activity. Also, consider correlating with network performance metrics or alerts from IDS/IPS systems.
