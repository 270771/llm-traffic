Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion further as it may indicate a TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning and SYN flood detection once anomaly data or heuristic context is available. Monitor for ICMP traffic specifically to detect ping floods in the future.
