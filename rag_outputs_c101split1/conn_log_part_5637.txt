Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the 7th column (value after source port). The values shown are mostly `0` or `1`, but none are `8`, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not represent ping requests and thus do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with types 0 and 1 (Echo Reply and other control messages) to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another anomaly.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Consider enabling more detailed ICMP logging or packet capture to analyze the traffic patterns further.
