Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is the 7th column after source and destination IPs and ports. In the given entries, the ICMP types are 3, 1, and 0 respectively. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request used in ping floods.  
- ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," type 1 is "Host Unreachable," and type 0 is "Echo Reply." These do not indicate a ping flood.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) typically sent rapidly from one or multiple sources to a target.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 and 1 messages to understand if there are network issues or other types of ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
