Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP echo requests with no indication of rapid, repeated traffic or overwhelming packet counts typical of a ping flood. The flags (OTH) and connection states do not indicate sustained or abnormal flooding behavior.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of volume and absence of other suspicious indicators, this traffic does not match a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these ICMP requests are expected in the network context (e.g., legitimate network diagnostics).
