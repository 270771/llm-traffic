Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would need to have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood. The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only UDP and TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to various 133.105.x.x addresses on port 5060 is suspicious but does not match ICMP ping flood patterns.
- The TCP entries show many SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating possible port scanning or reconnaissance, not ping flooding.
- Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the best match is a heuristic related to scanning or UDP flooding on SIP port 5060, but this is not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 on multiple hosts, as this may indicate a SIP-based UDP flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in future logs to detect actual ping floods.
- Apply heuristics for UDP flood or port scanning detection once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
