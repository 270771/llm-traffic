Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) sent in high volume to overwhelm a target, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 1 traffic is typically related to error messages, not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why multiple ICMP type 1 messages are being generated; this could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies that might indicate a different attack vector.
