Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.29.24.223 from different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic patterns for ICMP flood attacks, typically labeled as:  
- Heuristic: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single destination.  
- Taxonomy class: ICMP Flood / Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.29.24.223 (destination port 8, ICMP Echo Request)  
- Source IPs: 157.206.108.145, 157.206.197.166, 157.206.227.120, 157.206.169.190, 157.206.225.120, 157.206.149.9, and one unrelated ICMP type 0 from 202.250.216.227 to 71.38.173.252 (not part of the flood).

Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.29.24.223.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
3. Notify network operations to monitor for further ICMP flood activity and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if appropriate.  
4. Conduct a forensic analysis on the target host 3.29.24.223 to assess impact and ensure no compromise occurred.  
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged.
