Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion (S0) as this may indicate a TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning and incomplete handshakes once available. Monitor for any ICMP traffic separately to detect potential ping floods in the future.
