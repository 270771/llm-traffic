Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.6.38 to destination 89.180.124.4, with a single connection record and a duration of 1.4 seconds. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 35, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests suggests no ping flood or similar volumetric ICMP attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from the same source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 35 entries for potential network issues or other anomalies unrelated to ping floods.
