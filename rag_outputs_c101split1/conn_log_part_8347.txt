Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would require ICMP type 8) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network captures specifically for ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections here show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.  
- If suspicious TCP SYN floods or scans are suspected, apply heuristics related to SYN flood or port scanning for further analysis.
