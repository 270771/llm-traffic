Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 8 (echo request) or 0 (echo reply)? The given ICMP type field is 8 in the source port column, but the actual ICMP type field is not explicitly shown. However, the log shows ICMP protocol with unusual port values (8 and 0), which likely represent ICMP type and code. The source port is 8, which corresponds to ICMP type 8 (echo request), matching ping traffic.

However, the connection duration is 9 seconds with only 1 packet (last field), which is insufficient volume or frequency to indicate a ping flood attack. A ping flood involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest this is an attack.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP connection record.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from this or other IPs to detect potential flooding. Collect more data to confirm any anomaly.
