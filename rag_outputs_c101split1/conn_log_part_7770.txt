Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the ICMP type 3 message is a normal network control message and the single ICMP type 8 does not indicate flooding, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages are symptomatic of network misconfigurations or routing issues.
