Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this is not a ping flood. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is matched.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures specifically for ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm if any ping flood attempts occur outside this snippet. Also, review other protocol logs for signs of TCP-based attacks, as many connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.
