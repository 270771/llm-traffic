Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings). However, the volume and pattern in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP echo requests from different source IPs to the same destination IP, each with a single packet. This does not match the high-rate, sustained traffic pattern characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 8 is present but traffic volume is low and not repetitive, this traffic is normal ping activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from the same source IP or multiple sources targeting the same destination, which could indicate the start of a ping flood. If such patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy.
