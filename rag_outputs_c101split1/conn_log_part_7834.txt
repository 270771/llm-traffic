Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.136.80 and destination IP 51.158.44.35 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
