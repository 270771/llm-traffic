Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `-`, indicating no specific ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic is present. Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.105.143.2 to 45.121.95.154 to detect potential ping floods.
