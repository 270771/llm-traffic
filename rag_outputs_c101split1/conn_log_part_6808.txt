Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) all targeting a single destination IP (18.55.153.245) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources in the 130.187.x.x range and one from 210.162.65.31 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to 18.55.153.245. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host (18.55.153.245) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if the attack volume escalates.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
