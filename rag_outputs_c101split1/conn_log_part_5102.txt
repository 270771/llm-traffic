Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be numerous TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Correlate with other logs (e.g., ICMP logs) to confirm absence of ping floods and consider applying heuristics related to scanning behavior.
