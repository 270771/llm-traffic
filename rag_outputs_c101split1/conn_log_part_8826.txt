Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.143.78 to 43.248.47.1 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a target, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network traffic patterns for other types of ICMP abuse or reconnaissance.
