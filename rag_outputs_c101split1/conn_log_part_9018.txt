Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.196.70.79 from a wide range of source IPs within the 133.227.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs are multiple hosts in the 133.227.0.0/16 range (e.g., 133.227.214.164, 133.227.176.6, 133.227.67.6, etc.), all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.196.70.79. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.227.0.0/16 to 54.196.70.79.
  2. Investigate the source hosts for compromise or misconfiguration causing the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar patterns.
  4. Notify the network operations team and potentially upstream providers to assist in mitigating the attack traffic.
