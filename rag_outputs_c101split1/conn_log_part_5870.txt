Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type values of 3, 11, or 0 (field 4 and 10 combined indicate ICMP type/code). None have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, respectively, which are not indicative of ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed ICMP traffic appears to be normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP error messages, as excessive ICMP errors can indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 echo request floods to detect potential ping flood attacks.
