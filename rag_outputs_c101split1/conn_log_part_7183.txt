Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 13 packets from IP 133.243.229.195 to 167.46.181.109 to rule out potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based probing activities.
