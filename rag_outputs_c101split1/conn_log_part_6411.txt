Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have type values of 13 and 0, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) traffic to ensure it is legitimate, as excessive timestamp requests can sometimes indicate reconnaissance or other probing activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood attack.
