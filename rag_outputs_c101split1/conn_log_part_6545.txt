Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3, 3, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, and type 1 corresponds to "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)" depending on implementation, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate why there are multiple ICMP type 3 messages in a short time frame, as this could indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
