Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The only UDP entries have no indication of ICMP type or echo requests.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the lack of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled.
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
