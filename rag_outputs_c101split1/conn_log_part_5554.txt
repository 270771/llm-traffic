Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not shown here.
- The absence of ICMP entries means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some resets, typical of scanning or failed connection attempts, but not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect ping floods.
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources.
- Correlate with network flow data or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP anomalies.
