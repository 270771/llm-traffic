Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 traffic could indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.139.211 for potential misconfigurations or reconnaissance behavior. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages or other suspicious traffic patterns.
