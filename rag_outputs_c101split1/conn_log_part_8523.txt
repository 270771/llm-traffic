Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 13. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request." Neither is type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types indicate normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no underlying network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
