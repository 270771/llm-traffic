Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
