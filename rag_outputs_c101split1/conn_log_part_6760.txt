Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.227.90.79) from numerous distinct source IPs within the same second (timestamp 1641013210). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP flood attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 54.227.90.79 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.116.74, 133.243.15.105, 133.243.116.72, 133.243.173.229, and others as listed.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.227.90.79.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host to reduce impact.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
