Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the port field being 0), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets without signs of flooding or sustained attack patterns.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to confirm if they are legitimate responses (Echo Reply, type 0) or part of another benign or diagnostic process. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic volume that could indicate emerging threats.
