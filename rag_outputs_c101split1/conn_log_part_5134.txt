Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the condition for a ping flood is not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, TCP SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for possible scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to detect any potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable anomaly detection and heuristic logging to better classify suspicious traffic in future captures.
