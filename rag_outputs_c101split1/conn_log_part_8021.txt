Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 157.206.116.138 and 157.206.152.29, each with a single packet (last field = 1), which does not indicate flooding.  
- The third entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 203.78.143.78, which is a response, not a request, and also only a single packet.  
- No high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets is present, which is required to identify a ping flood.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP Echo Requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
