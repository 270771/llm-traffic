Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or UDP floods separately, as the current logs show many TCP connection attempts with S0 (SYN sent, no response), which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance but not ping flooding.
