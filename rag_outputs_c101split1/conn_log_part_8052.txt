Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (the 5th field after source IP is 3 or 11, but the ICMP type is indicated in the 6th field which is 0 or 1), none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Without ICMP type 8, these packets are not echo requests and thus do not match the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP traffic may represent other ICMP message types (e.g., echo replies or destination unreachable), which are not indicative of flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending multiple ICMP packets (e.g., 203.145.55.236) for potential scanning or other suspicious behavior, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted. If further anomaly data or heuristics become available, reassess accordingly.
