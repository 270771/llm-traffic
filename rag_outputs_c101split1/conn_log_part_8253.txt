Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 13 and 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP packets and no other suspicious patterns, no attack is detected here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other ICMP type 8 packets in the broader logs to confirm no ping flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- If timestamp requests (type 13) are frequent and unexplained, consider investigating potential reconnaissance activity.
