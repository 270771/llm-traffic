Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 133.105.114.40, but it shows a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) suggests normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. If volume or frequency increases significantly, investigate further for possible ICMP flood activity.
