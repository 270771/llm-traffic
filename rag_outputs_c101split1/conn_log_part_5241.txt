Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which requires ICMP type 8) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as ping floods would appear in ICMP logs.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, since many TCP connections here show S0 state (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts worth further analysis.
