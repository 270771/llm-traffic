Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has type 128 (indicated by the Zeek conn.log ICMP type field), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, not type 8 (ICMP Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP type and lack of anomalies, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs showing ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume from the same or other IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Also, monitor for other suspicious ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns.
