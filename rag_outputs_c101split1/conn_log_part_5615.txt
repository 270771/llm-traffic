Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). For example, types 0, 1, 3, 11, and 128 are present, but none are type 8. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references can be made. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP types observed (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded, type 128 = Echo Reply) to determine if they indicate other network issues or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would warrant re-evaluation for ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential related attacks such as ICMP scanning or network misconfigurations.
