Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 8 (echo request) or not? The field after source IP (203.78.143.78) is 8, which likely represents the ICMP type. However, the value is 8, which is the echo request type used in ping. But the next field after destination IP (23.236.31.177) is 0, which might be the destination port or code. The protocol is ICMP.

Wait, the ICMP type is 8, which is echo request, so it could be ping traffic.

However, the log shows only a single connection record with 128 packets over 7.185 seconds, which is not necessarily a flood. Also, no anomaly records are found, and no heuristic context is available.

Since no anomaly or heuristic data is present, and only one connection with moderate packet count is shown, this does not indicate a ping flood attack.

No attack is present. The traffic is normal ICMP echo request traffic.

No heuristic or taxonomy data is available to classify this further.

If further investigation is desired, monitor for sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time frame, which would indicate a ping flood.
