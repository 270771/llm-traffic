Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.42, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or volume indicators, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests exceeding normal thresholds.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected anomaly.
