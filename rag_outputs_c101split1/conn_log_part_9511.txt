Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting a single destination IP (54.241.243.41) from many different source IPs.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The volume and concurrency of these ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 54.241.243.41 (ICMP has no ports, so port is 0)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.149.219, 133.227.210.244, 133.227.117.63, 133.227.161.48, 133.227.63.197, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.241.243.41.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
