Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.237 and 133.105.230.235). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to classify this traffic as malicious.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from this source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Additionally, verify if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or scanning activity.
