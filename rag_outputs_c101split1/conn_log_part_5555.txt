Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would require ICMP type 8) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP echo request floods are occurring.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 flags (seen here) could indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.
