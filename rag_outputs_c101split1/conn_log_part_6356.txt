Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the types observed are 0, 3, and 10, none of which correspond to the ICMP Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 10 (Router Advertisement) packets to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- If suspicious patterns emerge in other protocols or ports, correlate with additional logs for comprehensive analysis.
