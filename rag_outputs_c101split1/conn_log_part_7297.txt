Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping flood traffic.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP error messages rather than echo requests, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Investigate why these ICMP error messages are generatedâ€”potentially due to network misconfigurations or other issues causing unreachable destinations or TTL expirations. Monitoring for a rise in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent to detect any future ping flood attempts.
