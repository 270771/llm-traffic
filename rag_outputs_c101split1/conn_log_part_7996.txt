Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries with type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping) packets. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood. The entries are sparse and involve different destination IPs without rapid repetition or overwhelming packet counts. There is no evidence of excessive ICMP traffic from a single source targeting one or few destinations, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of anomalies and the normal ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from single sources or towards single destinations. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or reconnaissance activity.
