Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- Since no ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity.  
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.  
- The traffic shows multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.  

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the current traffic aligns with typical TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts, not ICMP-based flooding.  
- If investigated, heuristic #1 (TCP SYN scan detection) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance" would be appropriate to consider for these connection patterns.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs.
