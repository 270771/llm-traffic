Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (last-but-one field before the final count), but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure it is not symptomatic of other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to identify other possible attack vectors.
