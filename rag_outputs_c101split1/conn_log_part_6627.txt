Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 7th field after the source and destination IPs and ports. Here, the ICMP type values are `3` and `0` for the two entries, respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to:  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  

These are normal ICMP control messages, not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs if there are repeated ICMP Destination Unreachable messages, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP type filtering and anomaly detection to improve future detection capabilities.
