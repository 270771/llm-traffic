Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 172.23.68.231 to 133.251.133.182, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be indicated by a large number of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window to detect potential flooding.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for denial-of-service symptoms.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data.
