Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 1 and 10, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

- ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 corresponds to "Router Advertisement," neither of which indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that these ICMP types are normal network control messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.243.206.21 and 157.206.50.68) for any unusual volume or patterns of ICMP type 1 or 10 messages, as excessive control messages can indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods promptly.
