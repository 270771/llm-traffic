Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here "icmp" protocol is followed by "-" for ports, and the ICMP type is indicated by the "1" in the 6th column after source IP, which corresponds to ICMP type 1 = "Destination Unreachable"). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 messages, as these often indicate network issues or unreachable hosts, which could be symptomatic of other network problems or misconfigurations. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 1 messages may help identify underlying network issues.
