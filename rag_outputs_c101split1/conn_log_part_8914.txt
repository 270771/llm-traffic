Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11, 0, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are two entries with ICMP type 8:  
  - From 36.174.61.68 to 133.105.143.103 with 1 packet of 28 bytes  
  - From 91.238.113.8 to 202.125.201.8 with 224 packets of 224 bytes over 0.817843 seconds  
- Although the second entry shows a higher packet count, the volume and rate do not clearly indicate a flood-level attack (which typically involves a very high rate of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target).  
- Other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 0 = Echo Reply) are not indicative of ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic is triggered.  
- The traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood (high-rate ICMP type 8 packets).

Next Steps:  
- Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP Echo Requests from IP 91.238.113.8 to 202.125.201.8 for any sudden spikes.  
- Investigate if the 224 packets in under a second represent a sustained pattern or a one-time burst.  
- Check for other signs of network degradation or related anomalies.
