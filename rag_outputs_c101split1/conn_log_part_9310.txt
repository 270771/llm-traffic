Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (100.84.99.85) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one host is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, assign the heuristic number as **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.  
- Taxonomy class: **T1: ICMP Flooding Attack**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 100.84.99.85 (no port, ICMP protocol)  
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.227.210.254, 133.227.210.249, 133.227.223.254, etc.)  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter or firewall to mitigate the flood.  
2. Monitor the target host (100.84.99.85) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.  
3. Implement ingress filtering to prevent spoofed IP addresses if applicable.  
4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.  
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential botnet involvement or compromised hosts within the source IP range.
