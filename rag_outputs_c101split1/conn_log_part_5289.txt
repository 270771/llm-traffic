Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the logs. The TCP entries mostly show SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood activity. Also, monitor for repeated SYN scans or other suspicious TCP connection patterns that may indicate reconnaissance or other attacks.
