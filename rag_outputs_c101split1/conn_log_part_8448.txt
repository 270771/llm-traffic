Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "11," which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this is normal ICMP diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 11 messages that could indicate network issues or other ICMP-based attacks, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
