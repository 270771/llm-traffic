Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 0, 1, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) packets for potential network issues or other reconnaissance activities.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
