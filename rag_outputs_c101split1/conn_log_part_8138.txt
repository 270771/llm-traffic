Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 5th field is the protocol number for ICMP, but the conn.log does not explicitly show ICMP type 8 anywhere). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets (likely ICMP Time Exceeded or Destination Unreachable messages) to ensure they are legitimate network control messages and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns is recommended.
