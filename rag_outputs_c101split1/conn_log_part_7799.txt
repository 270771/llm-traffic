Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 183.14.107.118 and 151.105.96.5. However, the volume of these requests is extremely low (only 1 packet each in the snippet), which does not match the high-rate traffic pattern typical of a ping flood attack.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 13 (Timestamp Request), which is not type 8 and therefore not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated OTH (other) connection states that might indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.
