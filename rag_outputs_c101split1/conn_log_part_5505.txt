Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be multiple failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential port scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these attempts are malicious and consider blocking or rate-limiting suspicious IPs.
