Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 7th field after source IP and port) is either 3 or 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed:  
- Type 3 is "Destination Unreachable"  
- Type 0 is "Echo Reply"  

This traffic could be normal network behavior or related to other ICMP diagnostics, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (210.162.66.25 and 203.78.140.163) for any unusual volume or patterns in other logs.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency to detect potential ping floods.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected ping flood.
