Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows no ICMP type explicitly, but the Zeek conn.log field for ICMP type is typically in the "id.orig_p" or "id.resp_p" columns, which here are numeric but do not indicate type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second ICMP record shows ICMP type 3 (from port 3) and ICMP code 1, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not Echo Requests (type 8).  
- Since the ICMP type is not 8 in either record, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 code 1 is typically related to network errors or unreachable hosts, which may warrant investigation for network misconfigurations or scanning activity but is not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.105.128.252 sending ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to 114.157.210.131 to ensure no misrouting or scanning is occurring.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
