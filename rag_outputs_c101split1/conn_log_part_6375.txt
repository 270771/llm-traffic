Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and neither entry matches this, these are not ping flood packets. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP Echo Requests and no suspicious volume or pattern, no ping flood or related attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not part of a larger network issue or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
