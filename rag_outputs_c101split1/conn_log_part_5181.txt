Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. There are no ICMP records or anomalies related to ICMP traffic in the provided data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a volumetric ICMP flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these attempts are malicious and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious source IPs.
