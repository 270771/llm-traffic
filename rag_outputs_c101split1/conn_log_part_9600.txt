Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded." Since ping floods specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, these ICMP types typically indicate network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
