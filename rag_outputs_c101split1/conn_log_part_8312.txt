Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network diagnostic traffic.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood, but monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 could be considered if network issues arise. Further investigation could include checking for other ICMP types or traffic volume anomalies.
