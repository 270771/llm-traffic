Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3 respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic. ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which are normal control messages or error responses, not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. However, these ICMP messages could be part of normal network diagnostics or error reporting.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.122 and 133.227.159.37) for unusual patterns or volume of ICMP error messages over a longer time window to rule out other network issues or reconnaissance activity.
