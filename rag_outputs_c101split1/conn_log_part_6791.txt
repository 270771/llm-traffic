Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network or host unreachable errors, which may be normal or symptomatic of other network issues but are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure there are no underlying network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- If suspicious traffic patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP Echo Request floods and update taxonomy accordingly.
