Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, respectively, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," which are normal control messages or responses, not attack traffic.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP packets and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from a single source IP, which would indicate potential ping flood activity. Also, investigate the source IPs 163.45.185.43 and 133.227.159.6 if they generate unusual volumes of other ICMP types or other suspicious traffic patterns.
