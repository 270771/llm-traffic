Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 3, 11, or other values, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, respectively, which are not indicative of ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to determine if there are network misconfigurations or other issues causing these error messages.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
