Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 corresponds to "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages if they are frequent, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
