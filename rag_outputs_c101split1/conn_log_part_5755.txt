Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, so no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. The observed traffic may indicate traceroute or TTL-expired messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.120 and 203.78.140.213) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
