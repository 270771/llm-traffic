Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.250.29) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 44.202.250.29 (ICMP does not use ports)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 130.187.192.159, 130.187.233.222, 130.187.26.122, 130.187.26.248, 130.187.19.246, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.250.29.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
