Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confirmed. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.185, 202.250.202.134) for unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 traffic if network performance issues arise, but no immediate threat is indicated here.
