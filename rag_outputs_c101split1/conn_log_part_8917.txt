Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.179.154.60, from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013229.96). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target in a short time frame.  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 54.179.154.60 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.103.51, 157.206.103.76, 157.206.13.220, 157.206.13.221, 157.206.248.48, 157.206.161.107, 157.206.40.150, 157.206.55.131, 157.206.241.78, 157.206.103.90, 157.206.146.218, 157.206.125.238, 157.206.241.93, 157.206.164.250, 157.206.146.29, 157.206.197.174, 157.206.141.95, 157.206.6.194, 157.206.248.220, 157.206.232.147, 157.206.110.27  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.179.154.60.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or mitigate the attack closer to the source.  
5. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other DoS vectors.  
6. If the victim is a critical asset, consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo responses until the attack subsides.
