Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- Heuristic for ping flood involves detecting high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP type 3 messages are present, as these indicate unreachable destinations and may suggest network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
