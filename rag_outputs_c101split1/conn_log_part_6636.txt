Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is likely error messages rather than ping requests.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, but ICMP type 3 typically does not indicate a ping flood. Without evidence of repeated ICMP echo requests or high volume from a single source, this does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from the source IP 120.245.103.198.

Next steps: Collect more data on ICMP echo requests and volume trends to confirm if any flooding occurs.
