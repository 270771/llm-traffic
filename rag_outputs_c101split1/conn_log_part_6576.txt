Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (indicated by the port field for the destination as `0`), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply) to ensure it is not part of a reflection or amplification attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs.
