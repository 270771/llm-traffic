Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.*) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Apply heuristics for TCP SYN scan detection if available, as the current traffic pattern suggests scanning rather than flooding.

Heuristic and taxonomy references cannot be assigned due to lack of data.
