Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, no ping flood is detected.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no identified ping flood or related anomaly.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given TCP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs specifically for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that may indicate TCP SYN scanning or SYN flood attacks.
- Establish heuristic and taxonomy definitions for anomalies to improve detection accuracy.
