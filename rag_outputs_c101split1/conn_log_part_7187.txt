Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is missing or indicated as "-", which means the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the ICMP type and payload. Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or other suspicious connection states that might indicate different attack vectors.
