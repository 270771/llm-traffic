Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack types are clearly indicated in the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm the absence of ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review TCP SYN flood or scanning heuristics if connection attempts increase abnormally.
