Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP echo reply from 49.228.114.254 to 203.78.143.78, not a flood of echo requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is a single ICMP reply and not a flood of requests, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks.

No immediate attack is present. However, if further investigation is desired, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) in high volume from the same source IP would be the next step to detect potential ping floods.
