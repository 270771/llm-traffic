Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port field (11) and destination port field (0). For ICMP traffic, the source port typically represents the ICMP type. Here, the ICMP type is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.250.216.227 sending ICMP type 11 messages to 96.225.210.243 to determine if these are part of a network troubleshooting or a misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or high-volume ICMP traffic that could indicate a future ping flood.
