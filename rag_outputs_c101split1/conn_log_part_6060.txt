Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "3" (the 4th field after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP Destination Unreachable message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate why there are ICMP Destination Unreachable messages from 5.131.34.9 to 202.101.172.161, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity, but it is not a ping flood. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic would be necessary to detect ping floods.
