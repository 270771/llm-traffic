Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would have protocol number 1, but the conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- The UDP traffic is mostly from source IP 45.121.95.154 to various destination IPs on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), not ICMP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern shows multiple UDP connection attempts with state S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply), consistent with scanning or failed connection attempts, not ping flooding.

Since no anomaly CSV or heuristic context is provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed pattern aligns with heuristic class "S0 scan" (failed connection attempts) rather than ICMP flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Enable logging or alerts on ICMP Echo Requests exceeding normal thresholds.
