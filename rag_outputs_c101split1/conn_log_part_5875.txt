Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek, to detect any potential ping flood activity that may not be reflected in the current conn.log snippet.
