Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP type 3 traffic may indicate network issues or misconfigurations but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure network reachability and proper routing, but no immediate security response for ping flood is warranted.
