Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 133.227.202.247 and 133.227.202.248 targeting 18.46.170.245, but these are isolated single entries with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8 or lack type information, so they do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The presence of isolated ICMP Echo Requests without volume or frequency anomalies does not meet typical heuristic thresholds for ping flood detection.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination, which could indicate emerging ping flood activity.  
- Investigate the source IPs 133.227.202.247 and 133.227.202.248 for any other suspicious behavior or correlation with other alerts.
