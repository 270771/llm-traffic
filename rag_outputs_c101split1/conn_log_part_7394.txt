Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection states are "OTH" (other), indicating these are not standard ICMP echo requests or replies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types explicitly.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request rates from these IPs (203.78.140.213 and 133.243.18.53) to destination IPs (64.190.198.162 and 178.80.77.109).  
- If ICMP type 8 packets are observed in high volume, re-evaluate for ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack pattern.
