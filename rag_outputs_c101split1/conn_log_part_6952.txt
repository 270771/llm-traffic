Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.  

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or brute force attempts.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for suspicious ICMP traffic.  

Heuristic and taxonomy references are not available, but typical heuristics for ping floods involve detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 packets, which are absent here.
