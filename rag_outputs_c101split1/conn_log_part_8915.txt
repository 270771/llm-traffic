Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic between IPv6 addresses with ICMP types 128 and 129. ICMP type 128 corresponds to "Echo Request" in IPv6 (ping request), and type 129 corresponds to "Echo Reply." However, the known criterion for a ping flood attack here is that the ICMP type must be 8 (which is the IPv4 Echo Request). Since these are IPv6 ICMP types and not type 8, this traffic does not match the ping flood pattern defined.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP Echo Requests and Replies are normal network diagnostic traffic unless seen in high volume or with type 8 in IPv4.

Next steps:  
- Monitor the volume and frequency of these ICMP packets to detect potential ICMP-based DoS attacks in IPv6, such as ICMPv6 Echo Request floods.  
- Investigate if the traffic volume is abnormally high or if there are other signs of network degradation.  
- Collect heuristic data on ICMPv6 traffic patterns to better classify future anomalies.
