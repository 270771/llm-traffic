Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.  
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network traffic captures to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any alerts related to ICMP or other DoS attack vectors.
