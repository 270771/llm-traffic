Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type in the first record is 9 (router advertisement) and in the second record is 0 (echo reply). A ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of echo request packets and no anomaly flags, there is no indication of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.139.207 and 202.250.230.253) for any unusual behavior in other logs, as ICMP type 9 and 0 traffic can be benign or part of network management.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns that could indicate emerging attacks.
