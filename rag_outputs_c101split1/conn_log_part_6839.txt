Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 messages typically indicate traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source of these ICMP Time Exceeded messages to ensure they are not part of a network misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
