Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The TCP entries show many connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), but this pattern aligns more with a SYN scan or connection attempts rather than an ICMP flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy can be made.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could be investigated under heuristics related to port scanning or SYN flood, but no explicit anomaly data is available.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN connection attempts (S0 state) from IPs such as 181.169.10.7 and 89.247.69.180, which may indicate a SYN scan or SYN flood.
- Enable ICMP logging or verify if ICMP traffic is being captured elsewhere to detect potential ping floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm or rule out ping flood activity.
