Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Only one entry in the snippet shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, it is a single packet from 210.162.65.194 to 140.191.0.14. The other ICMP entries have types 0, 8, or 11, but there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid repetition of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.  
- Correlate with network bandwidth and latency metrics to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets for possible traceroute or scanning activity, which may warrant further analysis.
