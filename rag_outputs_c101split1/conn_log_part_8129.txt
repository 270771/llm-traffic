Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, also not an echo request. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, these entries do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume to rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP traffic volume thresholds to detect future ping floods.
