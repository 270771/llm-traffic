Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-", and no explicit ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is indicated. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state "OTH" (other) and zero packet counts suggest these are likely incomplete or unrelated ICMP connections rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal ICMP traffic volume.  
- If ICMP traffic spikes with type 8, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using established heuristics.
