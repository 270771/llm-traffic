Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 8th field after the source and destination IPs and ports. Here, the ICMP type values are mostly `1` and `13`, not `8`. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries show type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, ICMP type 1 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, and type 13 indicates Timestamp requests, which are not related to ping floods.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.137.66 and others for unusual ICMP activity, as multiple ICMP types and destinations are involved. Check for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based anomalies, but no immediate ping flood is detected.
