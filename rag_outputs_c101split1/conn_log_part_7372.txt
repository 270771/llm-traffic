Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 record (from 106.15.119.198 to 163.45.183.50) but it does not show multiple rapid requests or unusually high volume indicative of a flood. The other entries are ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that a ping flood requires repeated ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 106.15.119.198 for any repeated ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate ping floods.  
- Monitor for any spikes in ICMP traffic volume or patterns of repeated Echo Requests.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts on ICMP anomalies.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the default classification is "No ping flood detected."  
- ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic may indicate network issues or traceroute activity, not attacks.
