Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm the absence of ICMP echo requests.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Analyze TCP SYN flood or port scanning heuristics if suspicious TCP connection patterns persist.

Heuristic and taxonomy references cannot be assigned due to lack of data.
