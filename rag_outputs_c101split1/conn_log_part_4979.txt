Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6).
- There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate ping activity.
- Since the ICMP type is not 8 or not present at all, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided.
- Typically, ping flood detection relies on identifying high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no relevant heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- Consider enabling ICMP-specific anomaly detection rules or heuristics in monitoring tools.
