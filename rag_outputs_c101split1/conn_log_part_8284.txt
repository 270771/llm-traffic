Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 from 23.151.175.35 to 202.250.197.63, which is an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 133.227.129.135 to 185.183.48.120.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The logs show only single or isolated ICMP packets.  
- No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if any other logs or network data show unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other protocol anomalies.
