Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state further, as these may indicate port scanning or other reconnaissance. Focus on the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts to identify potential attackers. Consider enabling IDS signatures for scanning and brute force detection.
