Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods. The first entry shows ICMP with a code of 11 (likely Time Exceeded), and the second entry lacks detailed ICMP type information but does not indicate type 8 either. Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given this, no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 11 traffic, as it may indicate network issues such as routing loops or traceroute activity.  
- Enable more detailed ICMP type logging to confirm the nature of ICMP packets in future captures.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
