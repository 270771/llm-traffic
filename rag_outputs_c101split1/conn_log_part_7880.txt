Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (18.46.170.245) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages (ping). The rapid succession of these requests from different source IPs (133.227.154.248, 133.227.164.1, 133.227.184.0) to the same target IP strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, assign the heuristic number as **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.  
- Taxonomy class: **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: 133.227.154.248, 133.227.164.1, 133.227.184.0  
- Destination IP: 18.46.170.245  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting internal hosts.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and identify any additional source IPs involved.  
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Alert the affected system administrators to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary disabling ICMP Echo responses on critical hosts.
