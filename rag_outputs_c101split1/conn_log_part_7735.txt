Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 11 and 3, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that these ICMP messages are normal network control traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network misconfigurations or routing issues causing ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
