Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All provided Zeek conn.log entries show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this is not a ping flood. The absence of ICMP entries means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these TCP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 states) for potential scanning or brute force activity. Collect ICMP logs or packet captures to verify if any ICMP traffic with type 8 is present elsewhere in the network data.
