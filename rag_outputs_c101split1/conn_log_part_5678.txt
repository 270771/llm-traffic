Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), but no sustained or volumetric ICMP traffic indicative of flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping flood attacks fall under ICMP-based DoS attacks (heuristic typically related to volumetric ICMP Echo Request floods).

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or high-rate connection attempts that might indicate other DoS or scanning activity.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules focused on ICMP traffic to catch future ping flood attempts.
