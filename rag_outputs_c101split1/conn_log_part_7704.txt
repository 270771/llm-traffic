Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show a type value of 8, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the packet counts are extremely low (1 and 0 packets), indicating no sustained or high-volume traffic typical of a ping flood attack. A ping flood requires a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the low volume and lack of repeated requests, this traffic does not match a ping flood or any other clear attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ICMP flood. Also, consider correlating with other logs or IDS alerts for broader context.
