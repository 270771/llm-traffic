Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (value '1' in both entries), which corresponds to ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the safest assumption is that this traffic is normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs (157.206.194.249, 156.39.57.102, 170.189.106.239) for any unusual behavior or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP error message abuse or network scanning.
