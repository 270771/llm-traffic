Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings), but there is only a single packet per connection record, and no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The conn.log entries show isolated ICMP echo requests without the flood pattern of numerous packets in a short time frame.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest otherwise.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests from the same IPs within a short time window to detect potential ping floods. If a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets is observed, investigate those IPs for possible ping flood activity.
