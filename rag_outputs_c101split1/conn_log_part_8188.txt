Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 11, 11, and 8 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. However, there is only one record with type 8, and it shows a single ICMP Echo Request from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.4.54 with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior (only 1 packet, 56 bytes). The other two entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other volumetric ICMP attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Establish heuristics to flag multiple ICMP Echo Requests within a short time window as potential ping flood attempts.
