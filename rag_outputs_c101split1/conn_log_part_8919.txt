Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (157.206.x.x range) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (54.179.154.60) in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.206.8.203, 157.206.106.248, 157.206.125.185, 157.206.255.13, 157.206.41.31, 157.206.255.253, 157.206.145.167, 157.206.106.166; Destination - 54.179.154.60; Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor the target host for service degradation and consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services. Additionally, investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or participation in a botnet.
