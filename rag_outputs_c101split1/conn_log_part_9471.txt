Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 17, 442, 443, 444, 445, and similar, but none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The traffic is predominantly UDP and TCP with no evidence of ICMP Echo Requests flooding.
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity related to ICMP or ping floods.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x IPs on port 5060, which may indicate SIP or VoIP scanning or abuse.
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Apply known heuristics for UDP flooding or SIP abuse if such patterns emerge.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic context is provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the ping flood classification.
