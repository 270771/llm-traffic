Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types. The only ICMP type 8 entries (Echo Request) are from IP 151.105.96.5 to two different destinations (133.105.230.206 and 133.105.230.219). However, the volume and frequency of these echo requests do not indicate a flood patternâ€”there are only two such entries in the snippet, which is insufficient to conclude a ping flood attack.

Other ICMP types present (3, 13) correspond to destination unreachable and timestamp requests, which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood heuristic would involve a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sustained high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service conditions.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related anomalies in other logs.
