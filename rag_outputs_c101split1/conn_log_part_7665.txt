Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 150.227.97.96 to 8.109.107.170 with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, this does not match a ping flood pattern.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), also not type 8.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be standard ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood.
