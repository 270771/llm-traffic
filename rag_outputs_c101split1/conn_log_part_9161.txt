Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 13, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP types other than 8 do not indicate ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP Time Exceeded or Timestamp messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping flood attempts.
