Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but no ICMP traffic entries.
- ICMP traffic would typically appear with protocol number 1, and the ICMP type field would be visible or inferred. Here, all entries are either UDP (protocol 17) or TCP (protocol 6).
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.
- The traffic pattern shows many UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), which could indicate scanning or SIP-related activity but not a ping flood.
- Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or DoS attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to identify ping floods promptly.
