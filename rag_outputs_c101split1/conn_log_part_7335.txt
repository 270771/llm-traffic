Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have an ICMP type value of 3 and 10, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 corresponds to "Router Advertisement." Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed, this traffic may indicate network diagnostic or routing messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (157.206.1.255 and 133.243.123.244) for unusual behavior or misconfigurations causing excessive ICMP error or router advertisement messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
