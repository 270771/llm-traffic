Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be a series of TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicative of scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state) as this may indicate a TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning and SYN flood detection for further analysis.
