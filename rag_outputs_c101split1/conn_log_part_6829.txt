Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping), but the destination ICMP type is 0, an echo reply. The connection duration is short (0.257567 seconds) with only 1 packet, indicating a single ping request and response rather than a flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available. The traffic matches normal ICMP echo request/reply behavior, not a flood.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP exchange. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 35.83.191.13 to the destination 163.45.176.42 to detect potential flooding patterns.
