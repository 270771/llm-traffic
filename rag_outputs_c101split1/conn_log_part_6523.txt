Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type values of 1, 10, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable), 10 (Router Advertisement), and 13 (Timestamp) indicate normal or other diagnostic ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual volumes or patterns of these ICMP types if network performance issues arise, but no immediate attack response is warranted based on this data.
