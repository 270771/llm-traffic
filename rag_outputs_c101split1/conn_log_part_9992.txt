Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the first entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, not an attack traffic.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source to a single destination or multiple destinations, which is typical in ping flood attacks. The snippet shows only two isolated ICMP packets with no indication of flooding or rapid repeated requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. Generally, ICMP echo requests (type 8) alone do not indicate an attack without volume or pattern anomalies.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any source IP sends a large number of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious ICMP traffic patterns.
