Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (the 7th field after source IP and port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between these hosts to ensure it is expected behavior and not part of a different ICMP-based reconnaissance or response anomaly. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect ping floods.
