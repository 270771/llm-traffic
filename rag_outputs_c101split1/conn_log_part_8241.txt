Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 23.151.159.113 to 163.45.132.86, which is a valid ping request.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 130.187.49.1 to 3.199.185.249, which is a reply, not a request.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a victim, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The log snippet contains only two ICMP connections with no indication of flooding or abnormal volume.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate if any other logs show increased ICMP traffic volume or other suspicious patterns.
