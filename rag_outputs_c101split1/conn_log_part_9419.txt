Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.  
- The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and UDP traffic on ports like 5060 (SIP) and 53 (DNS), which do not match ping flood characteristics.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- The lack of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the ping flood heuristic, which typically involves ICMP Echo Request floods.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP) from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses, as this may indicate SIP scanning or a SIP-based attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP logging if not already active to capture relevant ICMP traffic for analysis.
