Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP connections have type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- The log shows repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a few source IPs (151.105.96.5, 172.23.68.231) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to consume bandwidth or resources.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, assign the most likely heuristic as:
  - Heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame"
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood"

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: 151.105.96.5, 172.23.68.231
- Destination IPs: 133.105.230.24, 133.105.230.25, 133.251.142.125, 163.45.51.193
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if other hosts are involved or affected.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to monitor for potential collateral impact.
- Consider blacklisting or quarantining the source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
