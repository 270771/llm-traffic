Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show UDP or TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.150.x addresses on port 5060 appears to be SIP or VoIP related traffic attempts, not ICMP.
- The TCP entries show SYN packets (S0 state) but no evidence of flooding or ICMP activity.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 on multiple hosts, as this could indicate a UDP-based scanning or SIP enumeration attempt.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests are present outside this snippet.
- Monitor for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks given the multiple S0 states in TCP connections.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected in the provided data.
