Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The absence of ICMP traffic suggests no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is occurring.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log primarily logs connection-oriented protocols (TCP/UDP).  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 flags are visible, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not flooding.
