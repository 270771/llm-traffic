Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry has type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry has type 0, which is an "Echo Reply," not an echo request either.  
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 packets sent in rapid succession from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated echo requests.  
- Verify if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations that could be causing legitimate ICMP errors.
