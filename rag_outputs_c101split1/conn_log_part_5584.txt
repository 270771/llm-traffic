Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 0 (indicated by the field with value 0 after the destination port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP packets, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or any other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP type 0 packets (Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses to prior requests and not part of an unusual pattern. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect future ping flood attempts.
