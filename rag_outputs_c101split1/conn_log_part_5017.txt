Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods. Also, monitor for TCP scanning activity given the high number of SYN-only connections, which could indicate reconnaissance.
