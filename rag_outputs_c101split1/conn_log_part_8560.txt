Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 13 messages to ensure they are not part of a reconnaissance or timing attack. Monitor for any escalation to ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies involving these IPs.
