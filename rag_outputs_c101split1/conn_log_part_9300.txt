Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets originating from a single source IP (69.232.167.20) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.004 seconds total). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where an attacker sends a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets or the network.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source" and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 69.232.167.20; Destination IPs 203.78.140.161, 203.78.140.245, 203.78.160.4, 203.78.128.8, 203.78.147.24.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 69.232.167.20 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
- Notify network operations to investigate potential impact on targeted hosts.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update incident response procedures to handle volumetric ICMP attacks.
