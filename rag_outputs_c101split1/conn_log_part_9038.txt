Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from multiple source IPs within the 133.243.x.x range targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.241.41.56, 34.27.172.201, 52.45.247.73).
- The rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from many distinct sources to the same destination IPs is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP echo requests.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, which matches the known criteria for ping flood detection.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical heuristic for ICMP flood attacks, which can be assigned heuristic number **H-ICMP-01** (hypothetical) representing "High volume ICMP Echo Request flood."
- Taxonomy class: **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.243.15.100, 133.243.73.146, 133.243.253.199, 133.243.16.47, 133.243.10.169, 133.243.162.30, 133.243.10.222, 133.243.248.6, 133.243.216.133, 133.243.15.177, 133.243.5.10, 133.243.137.126, 133.243.107.245, 133.243.171.99, 133.243.152.205, 133.243.152.200, 133.243.229.182, 133.243.157.190, 133.243.31.4, 133.243.155.2, 133.243.73.158, 133.243.5.53, 133.243.248.124.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 54.241.41.56, 34.27.172.201, 52.45.247.73.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the field is 0 as expected.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on perimeter firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.243.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy network anomaly detection tools to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or outside expected operational regions.
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
