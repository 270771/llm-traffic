Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries at all, only TCP and UDP connections.  
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot match known ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP type fields are logged.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
