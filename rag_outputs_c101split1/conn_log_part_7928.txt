Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the packet count is only 30 over a very short duration (0.007639 seconds), which is not sufficient evidence of a flood-level volume. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without additional data indicating sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for a significant increase in ICMP type 8 packet rate from any single source IP. If sustained high-volume ICMP echo requests are observed, re-evaluate for ping flood activity. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 messages for potential network issues or misconfigurations.
