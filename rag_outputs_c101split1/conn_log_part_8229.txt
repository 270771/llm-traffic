Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in both entries is 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and frequency of these packets are extremely low—only two packets within a very short time frame—insufficient to constitute a flood. A ping flood typically involves a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of volume and absence of other suspicious indicators, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns or other attack types.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from these source IPs (54.254.233.234) to the destination IPs (202.101.170.242 and 202.101.170.235). If the rate spikes significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
