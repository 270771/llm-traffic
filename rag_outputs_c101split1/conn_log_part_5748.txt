Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries except one have ICMP type values other than 8, which means they are not echo requests (ping). The only entry with ICMP type 8 is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 133.105.85.5, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic or flood activity. The other ICMP flows have type values 1 or 10, which correspond to different ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, router advertisement), not ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP flood detection logic, a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 for any unusual ICMP echo request activity over a longer time window to rule out low-rate scanning or probing.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential related reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
