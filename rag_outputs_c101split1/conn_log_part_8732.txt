Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 13 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP types observed correspond to other ICMP message types (type 13 is Timestamp Request, type 0 is Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature and frequency of these ICMP messages to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or scanning activities. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be critical to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
