Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (indicated by the destination port field being `0` for ICMP, and no explicit ICMP type 8 shown), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the connection state is `OTH` (other), and the flags indicate no established session, which may suggest irregular ICMP traffic but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the ICMP type and payload. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from 202.101.171.237 to 64.190.198.160 to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.
