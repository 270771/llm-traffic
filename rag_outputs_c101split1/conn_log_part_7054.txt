Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 traffic could indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 163.45.240.190 for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
