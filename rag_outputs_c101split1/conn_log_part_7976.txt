Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second record shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single event with no indication of flooding or high volume. There is no evidence of repeated or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination that would indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is not an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
