Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry from 150.227.97.96 to 221.56.28.35 has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) and therefore does not indicate a ping flood. The second entry from 24.26.170.70 to 163.45.128.87 has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an initiating ping flood. No continuous or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are observed in the snippet.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious patterns or taxonomy classes can be assigned. The lack of type 8 ICMP packets means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other ICMP types that may indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
