Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have protocol number 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Given the lack of anomaly data and the ICMP type mismatch, no ping flood or related attack is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (202.250.216.227 and 213.211.87.194) for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages, which could indicate routing loops or traceroute activity rather than an attack.
