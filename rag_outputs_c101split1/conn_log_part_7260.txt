Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Only one ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, it is a single entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The other ICMP entries have type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps: Investigate if there are bursts of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window or from the same source IP to the same destination IP. Monitor for increased ICMP echo request rates or patterns consistent with volumetric flooding.
