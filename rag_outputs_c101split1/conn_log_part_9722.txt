Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (commonly related to ICMP Echo Request floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP flows.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, as there are multiple TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
