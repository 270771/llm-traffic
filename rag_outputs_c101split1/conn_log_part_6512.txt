Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic shows isolated ICMP packets with no indication of high volume or repeated echo requests typical of ping floods.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- Heuristic for ping flood would require repeated ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a network misconfiguration or traceroute activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate emerging ping flood attempts.
