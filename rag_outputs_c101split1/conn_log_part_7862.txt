Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1, 3, or 129, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 129 (ICMPv6 Echo Reply) suggest normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the volume or frequency of these ICMP error messages is unusually high, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If suspicious activity is suspected, enable more detailed logging or packet capture for deeper analysis.
