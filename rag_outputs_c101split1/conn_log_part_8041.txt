Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `11`, not `8`. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping requests. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages are typically related to network diagnostics or error reporting, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
