Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping flood detection. However, only one record shows ICMP type 8 (from 119.247.122.141 to 133.105.138.92) with a single packet and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other record shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Request traffic that would indicate a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The lack of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets means this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages indicate network issues or traceroute activity, which may be benign or warrant further network diagnostics.
