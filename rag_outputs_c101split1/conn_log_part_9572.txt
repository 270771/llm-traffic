Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request) but only a single packet (224 bytes) is recorded with a duration of about 3 seconds, which is insufficient to indicate flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious activity.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and patterns is recommended to detect any future anomalies.
