Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) but only a single packet with a duration of 1.398802 seconds and 168 bytes, which is insufficient to indicate flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ping floods require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a short time frame, which is not observed here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these logs. The heuristic for ping flood would be repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high frequency, and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high rates.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection states.
