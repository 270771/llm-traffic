Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 3 or 11, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries are type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest these are error or control messages, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network issues or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
