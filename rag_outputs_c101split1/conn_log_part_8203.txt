Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 65.148.121.107 to destination 163.45.180.180, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 2 (Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume from 65.148.121.107 to 163.45.180.180 could be prudent to detect any future escalation.
