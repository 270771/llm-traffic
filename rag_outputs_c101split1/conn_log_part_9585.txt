Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP, 54.254.197.94, targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x subnet. All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid succession of these Echo Requests to many different hosts within a very short time frame (timestamps are nearly identical) matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood**.  
- The taxonomy class is **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.254.197.94  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.123.95, 163.45.48.72, 163.45.5.56, 163.45.163.235, 163.45.215.26, 163.45.163.253, 163.45.216.242, 163.45.22.146, 163.45.150.250, 163.45.216.215, 163.45.22.186, 163.45.216.249, 163.45.78.216, 163.45.22.203, 163.45.159.30, 163.45.135.107, 163.45.173.33, 163.45.223.198, 163.45.78.220, 163.45.127.200  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.254.197.94 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or new ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.  
3. Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider about the abusive IP to consider blackholing or filtering.  
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting on internal routers to mitigate impact on internal hosts.  
5. Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify any compromised hosts or vulnerabilities exploited to launch the attack.
