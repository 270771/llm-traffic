Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The absence of ICMP traffic suggests no ICMP-based attack is occurring.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP entries.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks indicated by TCP flags (e.g., SYN floods) if suspicious patterns emerge in TCP traffic.
