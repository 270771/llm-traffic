Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections all targeting the same destination IP address (54.196.70.79) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request packets (ping). Multiple source IPs from the 133.227.x.x range are sending these requests in rapid succession within the same second (timestamp 1641013230.82xxxx), consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is a high-volume ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Attackers (sources): Multiple IPs in the 133.227.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.227.209.1, 133.227.75.0, 133.227.75.1, etc.)
- Victim (target): 54.196.70.79
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.227.0.0/16).
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns targeting 54.196.70.79.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if feasible to reduce impact.
6. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
