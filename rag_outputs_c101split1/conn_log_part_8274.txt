Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP packet with type 8 (Echo Request) is from 133.227.58.120 to 49.64.231.75, but it appears as a single event with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second ICMP entry has no type 8 and thus cannot be a ping flood. There is no anomaly data or heuristic context indicating suspicious behavior.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. Investigate if 133.227.58.120 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, which could indicate early stages of a ping flood.
