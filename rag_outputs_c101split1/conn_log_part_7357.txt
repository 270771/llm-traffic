Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (field 7) which is `0`. For ICMP echo requests (ping), the type must be 8. Since the type is not 8, this traffic does not represent a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the single log entry. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often means the connection did not complete normally, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If further investigation is warranted, it should focus on collecting more ICMP traffic logs to verify if multiple echo requests (type 8) are being sent in high volume from or to the involved IPs (133.227.58.122 and 86.30.110.26). Monitoring for repeated ICMP echo requests with type 8 would be the next step.
