Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0, 1, 3, 11, or 13, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not represent a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types such as Echo Reply (0), Destination Unreachable (3), Time Exceeded (11), and so forth, which are normal or diagnostic traffic rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.137.66 sending multiple ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as a high volume of such messages could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration. Monitoring for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other anomaly indicators is recommended.
