Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- The single ICMP type 8 record (second line) shows one packet from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.61, which is insufficient volume or frequency to indicate flooding.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, the default assumption is that no suspicious behavior matching ping flood heuristics is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or connection states changing to "SYN_SENT" or "OTH" with high frequency.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
