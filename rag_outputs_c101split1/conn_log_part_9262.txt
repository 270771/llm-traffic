Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP subtype column (field 11), which is "-", meaning no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types and payload patterns. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from the source IP 133.243.101.202 to destination 200.109.56.157.
