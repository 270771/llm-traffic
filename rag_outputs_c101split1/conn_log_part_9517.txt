Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the conn.log entry indicates ICMP protocol with no further detail on type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not specifically indicate a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Further investigation could include capturing full ICMP packet details to verify ICMP types and monitoring for high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 203.78.132.227 to the destination 89.247.69.144.

Next steps: Enable detailed ICMP logging to capture type and code fields, and monitor traffic volume for potential flooding behavior.
