Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (value 0), but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific classification.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and code fields. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns that may indicate reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
