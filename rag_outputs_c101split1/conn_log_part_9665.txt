Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding. The first entry shows a single ICMP echo request from 183.204.158.107 to 133.105.14.74, and the second from 18.76.68.232 to 163.45.193.116, each with only one packet and no rapid repetition or high packet count typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no excessive ICMP traffic or repeated echo requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attack patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP echo requests occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, consider correlating with other logs or IDS alerts for broader network anomaly detection.
