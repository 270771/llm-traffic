Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood but rather error or control messages.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. However, the presence of ICMP error messages could warrant further investigation into network reachability or misconfigurations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 1 messages to ensure no underlying network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual ICMP volume that could indicate a developing ping flood.
