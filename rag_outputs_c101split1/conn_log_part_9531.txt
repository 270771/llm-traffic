Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show UDP or TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood can be detected.
- The traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.195.x IPs is UDP on port 5060, which is typically SIP signaling traffic, not ICMP.
- The connection states (S0, D, F) indicate connection attempts or drops but do not indicate flooding or ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple targets on port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Review firewall and IDS rules for UDP port 5060 to prevent abuse.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class applies here.
- If UDP flooding is suspected, heuristic for UDP flood (commonly heuristic #17 in some taxonomies) and taxonomy class "Network DoS" could be considered for further investigation.
