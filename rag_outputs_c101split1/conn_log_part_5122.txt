Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since no ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity.
- The connections show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the observed TCP SYN failures could align with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks).
- Taxonomy class would be "Reconnaissance" or "Scanning" rather than DoS or flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN failures for potential port scanning or network reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs.
