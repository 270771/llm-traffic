Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP type 3 messages that could indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but no immediate security threat related to ping flooding is evident.
