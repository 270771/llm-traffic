Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, no ping flood is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the S0 state typically corresponds to "Connection attempt failed" or "Port scanning" heuristics in common taxonomies.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts (S0) for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity. Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to confirm if these represent a scanning campaign or other attack vectors. Also, monitor for any ICMP traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.
