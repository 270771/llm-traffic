Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 13, 10, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 13 (Timestamp Request), 10 (Router Advertisement), and 0 (Echo Reply) traffic to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.
