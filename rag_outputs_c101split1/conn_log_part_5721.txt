Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port: here it is "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Destination Unreachable messages are being generated at this rate, as it may indicate network misconfiguration or other issues unrelated to ping floods. Monitoring for other ICMP types or traffic volume spikes is recommended.
