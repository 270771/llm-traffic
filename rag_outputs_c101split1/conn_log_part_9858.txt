Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet has ICMP types 1, 13, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The ICMP types observed correspond to:  
- Type 1: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  

These do not indicate a flooding attack but could be part of normal network diagnostics or error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.159.37, 133.243.229.195, 163.45.185.70) for unusual behavior or repeated error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data once available.
