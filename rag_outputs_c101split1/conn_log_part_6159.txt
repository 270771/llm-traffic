Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (161.4.185.99) targeting many different destination IPs with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker IP: 161.4.185.99 (source)
- Victim IPs: 163.45.94.119, 163.45.180.198, 163.45.58.68, 163.45.52.201, 163.45.9.78, 163.45.18.194, 163.45.48.5, 163.45.14.157, 163.45.39.139 (destinations)
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 161.4.185.99 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
