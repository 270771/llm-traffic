Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP types 1 or 3, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and echo reply or other control messages (type 1), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. However, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration, which may warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs. Investigate the source IPs 133.227.157.48, 163.45.128.105, and 202.244.66.143 for unusual behavior or other suspicious activity.
