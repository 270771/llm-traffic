Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is indicated by the Zeek ICMP code field, which here is `1` (the 7th and 10th fields correspond to ICMP type and code). Since the ICMP type is 1 (ICMP type 8 is Echo Request, which is used in ping floods), this traffic does not represent a ping flood. ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," which is not related to ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no other attack type can be confidently identified from this single entry.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP type 1 messages indicating network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
