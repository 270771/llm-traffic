Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with ICMP type values of 11, 8, and 8 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding: there are only single or very few packets per connection (not a high rate or volume typical of ping floods). The first entry with ICMP type 11 is a Time Exceeded message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would require sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 151.105.96.5 and 190.223.109.97 for any unusual activity patterns.  
- Enable rate limiting or alerting on ICMP echo requests if volume spikes occur.
