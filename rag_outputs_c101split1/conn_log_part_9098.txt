Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from 192.228.186.74 to 221.3.55.198 with a single packet (count=1), which does not indicate flooding.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 10 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and patterns continuously is recommended to detect any future anomalies.
