Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record is type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an initiating flood.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.  

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate traceroute or network issues, which could be investigated further if unusual volumes are seen.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious ICMP patterns.
