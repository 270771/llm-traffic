Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but ICMP type 3 typically indicates network or host unreachable messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood but may suggest network issues or misconfigurations.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are routing or firewall issues causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
