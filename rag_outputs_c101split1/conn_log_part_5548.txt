Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The logs show mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), many of which are rejected or incomplete connections, but none are ICMP or match ping flood characteristics.

Since no ICMP traffic is present, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed traffic pattern resembles a TCP SYN scan or connection attempts (S0 state), which typically falls under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics in common taxonomies.

Next Steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts from multiple source IPs to various destination ports, as this may indicate scanning or probing activity. Monitoring for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks is recommended. Collect ICMP logs separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
