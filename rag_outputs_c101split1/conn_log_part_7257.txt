Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (value "0" here), but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as "8" (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate other attack types.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and code values. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.140.213 to destination 2.77.122.73, which would indicate a potential ping flood.
