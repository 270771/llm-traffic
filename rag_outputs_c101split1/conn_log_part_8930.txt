Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.23.69.72) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013230.07). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 3.23.69.72 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.121.112, 133.243.65.81, 133.243.75.87, etc.)
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.23.69.72.
2. Identify and block or quarantine the attacking source IPs at the firewall or intrusion prevention system.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
5. Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or appliance if attacks persist or escalate.
