Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, a single or very limited number of ICMP type 8 packets do not indicate a flood. There is no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one source to one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window.  
- Investigate if the source IP 151.105.96.5 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests to 133.105.230.173 at a high frequency.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs or enable rate-based anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to detect potential flooding.
