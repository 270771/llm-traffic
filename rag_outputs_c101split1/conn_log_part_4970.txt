Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 17 (UDP) or TCP/UDP protocols; there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present.
- Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.
- The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP DNS queries, none indicating ICMP echo floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.
- The observed traffic could be indicative of scanning or reconnaissance (many TCP SYN attempts to various ports), which aligns with heuristic class "SYN scan" or "Port scan" in common taxonomies.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts from IPs such as 89.247.69.146 and 167.46.173.231 for potential scanning activity.
- Enable logging and alerting on repeated SYN attempts to unusual ports.
- Correlate with IDS/IPS alerts for scanning or brute force attempts.
- Collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate ping floods.
