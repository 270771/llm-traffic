Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is observed, the fundamental condition for detecting a ping flood is not met. The log entries mostly show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating connection scans or failed connection attempts rather than ICMP floods.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic pattern suggests possible reconnaissance or scanning activity (TCP SYN scans), which aligns with heuristic classes for scanning but not flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm scanning behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking suspicious source IPs. Also, enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
