Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- Heuristic for ping flood involves high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service" or "Flooding Attack."

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 11 messages, which may indicate network routing issues or traceroute activity rather than an attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
