Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 0 = Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or other ICMP-related anomalies, but no immediate ping flood response is required.
