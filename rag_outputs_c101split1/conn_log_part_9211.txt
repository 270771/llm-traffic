Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All the conn.log entries show UDP or TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The traffic is mostly UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP ports, none related to ICMP.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ICMP Echo Request traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs, as this could indicate SIP scanning or UDP flooding.
- Apply heuristics related to UDP flooding or SIP abuse if available.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
