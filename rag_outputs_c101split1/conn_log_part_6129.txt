Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1 or 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is that the ICMP type must be 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different reconnaissance or denial-of-service pattern.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.
