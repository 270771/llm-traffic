Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP connections are present, each with a single packet (`-` in packet count fields and `1` in the last field likely indicating one packet). This does not match the high-rate, sustained traffic pattern characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if these isolated pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance activity.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes significantly, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" for further analysis.
