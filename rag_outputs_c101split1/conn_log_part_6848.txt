Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (54.236.220.60) sending numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.03 seconds per packet). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from one source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.236.220.60; targets include multiple 163.45.x.x addresses (e.g., 163.45.3.112, 163.45.0.113, 163.45.34.254, etc.). ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.236.220.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flooding attempts from this or other sources.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
