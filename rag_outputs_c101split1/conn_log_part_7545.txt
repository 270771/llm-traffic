Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the destination port field (which for ICMP is the ICMP type). The entries show ICMP types 13 and 3, but none with type 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 13 indicates "Timestamp Request," which are not related to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
