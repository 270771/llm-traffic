Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field value `1` (the 7th field after IPs and ports is `icmp`, and the 4th and 8th fields after IPs/ports are `3` and `1` respectively). ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" (ping). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions:

- Heuristic: N/A (no explicit heuristic available)  
- Taxonomy: This traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues causing ICMP Destination Unreachable messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood attempts.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect future ping floods.
