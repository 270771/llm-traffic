Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or volumetric attacks. The UDP entries are similarly sparse and do not show flooding patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics (e.g., heuristic #1: port scanning) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance," but this is speculative without explicit data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 45.121.95.154) for potential scanning or probing activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to detect volumetric or DoS attacks not visible in this snippet.
