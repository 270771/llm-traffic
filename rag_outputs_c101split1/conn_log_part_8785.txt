Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from multiple source IPs (notably 54.249.65.236 and several 157.206.x.x addresses) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013228.82). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where the attacker attempts to overwhelm the target(s) with excessive ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests" indicating a volumetric ICMP flood.  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP flood attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attackers: 54.249.65.236, 157.206.124.98, 157.206.124.178, 157.206.155.18, 157.206.124.226, 157.206.160.1, 157.206.77.142  
- Targets: 203.78.128.75, 203.78.128.240, 203.78.128.228, 203.78.135.87, 203.78.135.92, 203.78.135.79, 203.78.133.112, 203.78.133.222, 203.78.133.120, 3.29.24.223  
- ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering or mitigation.  
5. Consider deploying DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume impacts service availability.
