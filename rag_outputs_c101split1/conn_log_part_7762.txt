Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `8` in the source port column, which typically represents an ICMP Echo Request (ping). However, the destination port is `0`, and the connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating these are isolated ICMP packets rather than a sustained flood. Additionally, there are only two entries with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these packets are part of a coordinated attack. Without evidence of high packet rate or volume, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity.  
- Confirm if ICMP traffic is expected in this environment or if it should be restricted.

Heuristic and taxonomy are not applicable here due to lack of anomalies or context.
