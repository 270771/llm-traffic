Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are primarily type 1 (ICMP Destination Unreachable) and type 3 (ICMP Destination Unreachable), with no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present. Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 1 traffic often relates to network scanning or misconfiguration rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (157.206.194.249, 133.243.89.179) for potential scanning or misconfiguration activity, as repeated ICMP Destination Unreachable messages may indicate probing or routing issues. Monitoring for increased volume or changes in ICMP type 8 traffic is recommended to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
