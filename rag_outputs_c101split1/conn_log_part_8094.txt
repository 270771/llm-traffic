Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 0 (Echo Reply), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) often relates to traceroute or routing issues, and type 0 (Echo Reply) is a response to a ping, not an attack vector itself.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 202.250.230.254 sending ICMP type 0 replies and 62.131.140.217 sending ICMP type 11 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics and not part of a reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attack.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
