Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these entries do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate traceroute or network diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (202.250.202.134 and 202.250.230.253) for unusual behavior or volume of ICMP type 11 messages if network performance issues arise, but no immediate security response is warranted for ping flooding.
