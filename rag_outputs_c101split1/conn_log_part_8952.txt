Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th field after the source IP and port. For example, in the first entry:  
`86.15.57.184	11	203.78.143.78	0	icmp`  
Here, the ICMP type is `0` or `11` or other values, but none of the entries show ICMP type `8` (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Instead, types like `0`, `3`, and `11` appear, which correspond to Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, and Time Exceeded respectively.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 8 = Echo Request (ping)  
- Other types indicate different ICMP messages, not ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) for possible network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
