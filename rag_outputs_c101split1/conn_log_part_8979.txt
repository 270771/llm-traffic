Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is not ICMP type 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there is ICMP Echo Reply traffic without corresponding Echo Requests, which could indicate misconfiguration or other network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 157.206.202.224 to destination 3.197.247.113 to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
