Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response rather than an attack initiation. No anomalies are recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy data is available to suggest another attack type.

No attack is present. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo reply communication. Without heuristic context or anomaly records, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to the destination (133.105.230.252) at high frequency, which would indicate a potential ping flood. Also, review broader network logs for volume spikes or other ICMP types.
