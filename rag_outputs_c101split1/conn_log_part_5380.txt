Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP entries are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommended next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Apply heuristics related to scanning detection and monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
