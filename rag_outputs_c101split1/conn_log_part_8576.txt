Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 157.206.74.18 to 163.84.73.84 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, the volume and frequency in this snippet are insufficient to confirm a flood.  
- The second entry is ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- No repeated rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination are evident here, which is a key indicator of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sustained high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP to a target IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 157.206.74.18 generates multiple echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for potential denial-of-service symptoms.
