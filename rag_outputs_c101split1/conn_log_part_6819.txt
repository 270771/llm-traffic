Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.214.140 and destination IP 185.167.248.21 for unusual ICMP timestamp requests or other suspicious activity. Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.
