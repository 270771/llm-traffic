Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 1, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 0 (Echo Reply) and 1 (Destination Unreachable) are normal ICMP message types used in network diagnostics and error reporting, not indicative of flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for any unusual volume or repeated error messages that might indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
