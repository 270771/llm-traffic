Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 1 (which is an ICMP destination unreachable message), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request). However, there is only a single ICMP echo request record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be characterized by a large number of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP(s) to the same destination IP(s).  
- Investigate if any other logs or network monitoring tools report unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If a surge in ICMP echo requests is detected, apply known heuristics for ICMP flood detection and classify accordingly.
