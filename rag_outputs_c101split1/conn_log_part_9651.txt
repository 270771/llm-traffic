Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.76.68.232) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages, the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- The packets are sent in rapid succession (timestamps within milliseconds), consistent with flooding behavior.
- The uniform packet size (56 bytes) and short duration between packets further support the pattern of a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 18.76.68.232
- Multiple victim/destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 18.76.68.232 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., traffic shaping, blackholing).
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
