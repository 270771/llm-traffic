Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP types are 1 and 13, not 8. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to:

- Type 1: ICMP Destination Unreachable  
- Type 13: ICMP Timestamp Request  

These types do not indicate a ping flood but could be part of normal network diagnostics or other ICMP-related activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.134.15 and 157.206.133.125) for unusual volume or frequency of ICMP messages if network performance issues are observed.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to rule out other ICMP-based attacks such as ICMP scanning or reconnaissance.
