Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 203.78.132.112 to 63.33.97.6 with a single connection record and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 1, 3, 10, and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood. The other ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3), echo reply (type 0 or 1), or other control messages, which may indicate normal network behavior or other issues but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.132.112 for any unusual ICMP traffic patterns over a longer time window to confirm no stealthy ping flood is occurring. Also, review network device logs for ICMP error messages (types 3, 10, 13) to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or attacks causing these ICMP errors.
