Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry has type 8 (Echo Request), but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious activity.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from any IP, which could indicate a future ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
