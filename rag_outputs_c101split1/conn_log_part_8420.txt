Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided in the snippet. However, the ICMP code field values (3 and 11) correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectively, not ICMP Echo Request (type 8) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP types suggest network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.235.229 and 133.227.58.122) for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing these ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect possible future ping floods.
