Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 58.13.7.9 to destination 133.251.157.83, with only 1 packet and 28 bytes, which is insufficient volume to indicate a flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.  

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding.  

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 58.13.7.9 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
