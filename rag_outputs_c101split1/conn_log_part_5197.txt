Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (icmp.log) are available to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Review for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, as many connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts.  
- If suspicious TCP SYN floods are suspected, apply heuristics related to SYN flood detection and monitor connection failure rates.
