Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP code field shows 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Destination Unreachable messages are being generated between 133.105.128.252 and 185.167.249.147, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
