Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single entry with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no indication of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency, which would suggest a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection states.
