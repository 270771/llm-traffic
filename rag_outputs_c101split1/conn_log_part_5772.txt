Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record (36.174.61.204 â†’ 133.105.248.152) with just 1 packet and 28 bytes, which is insufficient to indicate flooding. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 36.174.61.204 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts on ICMP traffic anomalies.
