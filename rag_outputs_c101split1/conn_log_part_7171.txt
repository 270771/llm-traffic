Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (icmp.log) to check for ICMP echo request floods.  
- Monitor for other TCP-based anomalies, such as SYN floods or port scans, since many TCP connections here show S0 state (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts worth further analysis.  
- If available, apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning for these IPs and ports.
