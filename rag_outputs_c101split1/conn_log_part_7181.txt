Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which are from source IPs 203.78.140.235 and 203.78.139.214 targeting 39.123.87.124. The other ICMP types are not type 8, so they do not qualify as ping flood traffic. Additionally, the number of ICMP Echo Requests is very low (only two entries), and the durations and byte counts do not indicate a high volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of sustained or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests means this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood (which requires many ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame).

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets (203.78.140.235 and 203.78.139.214) for any unusual behavior or repeated attempts over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or anomalies, as some entries show ICMP types 1 and 0, which could be related to other network issues or reconnaissance.
