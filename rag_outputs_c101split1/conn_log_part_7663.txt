Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types: 3, 13, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single entry with ICMP type 8 (from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.155), but it is isolated and not indicative of a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 13 = Timestamp Request) do not correspond to ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy, a ping flood would be classified under ICMP-based DoS attacks, and heuristic detection would focus on high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window beyond this snippet.  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP error floods or timestamp request floods, given the presence of types 3 and 13.
