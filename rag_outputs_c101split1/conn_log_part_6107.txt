Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate floodingâ€”only a single packet is logged with a short duration and no repeated rapid requests from the same source to the same destination. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.
