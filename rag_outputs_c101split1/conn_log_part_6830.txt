Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate ping activity. Since the ICMP type is not 8, no ping flood can be detected here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes related to ping flood or ICMP anomalies are applicable here due to lack of ICMP traffic. The absence of anomaly records confirms no flagged suspicious activity in this snippet.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS alerts for ICMP anomalies.
