Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 13 traffic could be legitimate network diagnostics or time synchronization attempts.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (133.243.18.124) to the destination (167.246.129.119). If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
