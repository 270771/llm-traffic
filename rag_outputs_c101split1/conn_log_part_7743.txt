Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections, but only those with ICMP type 8 represent echo requests (ping). Here, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.106 and 133.105.230.107), each with a single packet (`-` in the packet count field except the last field which is 1). The other entries have ICMP types 1, 3, or other values, which are not echo requests and thus not part of a ping flood.

No evidence of high-volume or repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to a target is present, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if this were a ping flood, it would typically fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify unusual ICMP activity.
