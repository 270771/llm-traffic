Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). No such ICMP traffic is visible here.
- The connections mostly show SYN scans or failed connection attempts (S0 state), typical of port scanning or reconnaissance, not ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.
- The traffic pattern suggests possible scanning activity (heuristic: network reconnaissance; taxonomy: scanning), but this is distinct from a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154, which may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request floods in future logs to detect ping floods.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to better detect ICMP-based attacks.
