Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded messages, which are typically related to network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.  

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Without heuristics or taxonomy data, treat these ICMP messages as normal network diagnostic traffic unless volume or patterns change.
