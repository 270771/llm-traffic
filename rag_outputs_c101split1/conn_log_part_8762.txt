Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP anomalies.
- If TCP SYN floods or UDP floods are suspected, analyze connection flags and packet rates accordingly.
