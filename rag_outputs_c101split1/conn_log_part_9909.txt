Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the 11th column (ICMP type/code). Both entries show ICMP type values of `-` (unknown or not specified) or `0` (Echo Reply), but not `8` (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP type is missing or zero; verify if logging or parsing is correct.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Check if the observed ICMP traffic corresponds to other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or scanning activity, as type 0 (Echo Reply) alone is not indicative of an attack.
