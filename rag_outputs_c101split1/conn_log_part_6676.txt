Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1 or 0, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic could represent other ICMP message types such as destination unreachable (type 3) or echo reply (type 0), which are normal or benign in many cases.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP messages further by correlating with network topology and host behavior to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or misconfigurations. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
