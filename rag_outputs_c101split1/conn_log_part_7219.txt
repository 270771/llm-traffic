Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest another attack type.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.120 and 157.206.194.66) for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious activity since ICMP type 11 and 3 messages can indicate network issues or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
