Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the correct type for ping requests. However, these echo requests are sparse and not occurring at a high frequency or volume indicative of a flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11, 0) are not related to ping floods.  
- There is no anomaly data or heuristic context provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this as a ping flood or any other attack.  

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 8 alone does not confirm a ping flood without volume or rate evidence.  

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) messages for potential network issues or other attack vectors.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
