Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies to this entry as it does not match ping flood criteria. Further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 101.119.28.74 to detect potential ping floods.
