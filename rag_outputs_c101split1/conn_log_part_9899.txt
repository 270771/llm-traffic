Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (3.241.1.60) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages (ping).
- The frequency and distribution of these ICMP Echo Requests to many different IPs within a short time frame strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 3.241.1.60
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 3.241.1.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or new sources of ICMP flooding.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies to mitigate impact on internal and external hosts.
5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block abusive traffic if attack volume is large.
6. Collect and preserve logs for forensic analysis and potential legal action.
