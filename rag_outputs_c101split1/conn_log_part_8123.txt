Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out by network devices.
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods, as many TCP connections show S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags, which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts. This would correspond to heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning or DoS, if available.
