Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is ICMP but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate why numerous Destination Unreachable messages are being generated between these IPs, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic would be necessary to detect any future ping flood attempts.
