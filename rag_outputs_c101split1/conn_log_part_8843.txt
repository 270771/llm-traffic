Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. These ICMP messages do not indicate a denial-of-service or flooding attack but could be part of normal network diagnostics or error reporting.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volume of ICMP error messages over a longer time window to rule out other network issues or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
