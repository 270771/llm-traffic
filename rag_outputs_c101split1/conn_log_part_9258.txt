Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single event with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. There is no evidence of repeated or excessive ICMP Echo Requests from one source to a destination that would indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records are found and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to network diagnostics or routing issues, not attacks.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages indicate network misconfigurations or routing loops.
