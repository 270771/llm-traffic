Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the packet counts are very low (only 1 packet each), indicating no high-volume or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to high packet rate or volume of ICMP type 8 traffic.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs (222.175.165.148 and 122.26.190.52). If packet rates spike significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts.
