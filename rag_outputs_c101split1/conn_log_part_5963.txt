Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but the ICMP type values are 8, 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the two entries with type 8 have very low packet counts (224 and missing data) and no indication of rapid repeated requests from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would focus on high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the sources 85.187.231.218 and 203.78.143.78 for any unusual ICMP traffic volume over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency to detect potential flooding.  
- Check for other ICMP types (3, 11) that may indicate network issues or other attack types like traceroute or network scanning.
