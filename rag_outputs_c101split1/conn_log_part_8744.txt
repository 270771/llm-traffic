Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (3.17.238.136) from different source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The volume and distribution of these echo requests from multiple sources to a single target strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a host with excessive ping requests to degrade its availability.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.17.238.136 (no port, as ICMP is layer 3)  
- Source IPs: 130.187.26.34, 130.187.233.57, 130.187.192.50, 130.187.233.195, 130.187.228.105, 130.187.26.32, 130.187.195.49

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.17.238.136.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or follow-up attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical hosts if business operations allow.
