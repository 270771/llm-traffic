Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping traffic relevant to a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - 151.105.96.5 → 133.105.230.242 (type 8)  
  - 220.254.134.232 → 133.105.107.103 (type 8)  
- However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding: only single packets per connection are logged, no rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination.  
- The other ICMP entry (type 11) is a Time Exceeded message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If heuristics were available, a ping flood would typically fall under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to ICMP echo request volume.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time window to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate the sources 151.105.96.5 and 220.254.134.232 for any unusual ICMP activity over time.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify emerging patterns.
