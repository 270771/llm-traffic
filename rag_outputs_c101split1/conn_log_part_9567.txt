Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and frequency in the snippet are very low (only two entries, spaced about 0.02 seconds apart), and there is no indication of a high rate or sustained flood pattern typical of ping flood attacks. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no anomalies are detected and no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no attack classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation. Collect more comprehensive logs to analyze traffic patterns over time.
