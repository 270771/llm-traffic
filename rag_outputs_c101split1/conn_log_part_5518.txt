Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes are explicitly found or applicable here due to lack of ICMP or anomaly data.

Next Steps:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks. Also, monitor for other TCP-based anomalies such as SYN floods or port scans, as the logs show many TCP connection attempts with SYN flags set but no successful connections (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.
