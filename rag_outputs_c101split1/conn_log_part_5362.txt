Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP records present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs performing repeated TCP connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.* range) for potential port scanning or brute force attempts. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
