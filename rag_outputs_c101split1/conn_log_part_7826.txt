Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 8, 11, and 8 respectively. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping flood detection. However, the volume and pattern here do not indicate flooding: only single packets per connection are logged, with no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP(s).  
- Monitor for sustained high-volume ICMP traffic patterns that could indicate flooding.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for denial-of-service symptoms.
