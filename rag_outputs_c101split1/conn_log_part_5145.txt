Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed behavior aligns with possible reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high number of SYN-only TCP connections for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with IDS/IPS alerts or firewall logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection attempts.
