Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `3` (destination unreachable), not `8` (echo request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 typically indicates network issues or scanning activity but not flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.194.249 and destination IP 123.244.19.226 for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity, as repeated ICMP type 3 messages can indicate probing or routing problems.
