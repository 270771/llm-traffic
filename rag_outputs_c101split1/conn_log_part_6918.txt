Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for traffic to be considered a ping flood.  
- In the provided Zeek conn.log snippet, the first entry shows ICMP type 8 from source IP 36.174.61.83 to destination 133.251.115.70, but only a single packet is logged (count=1), which does not indicate flooding.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 133.243.71.2 to 5.71.123.170, which is a response, not a flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests if volume thresholds are exceeded.
