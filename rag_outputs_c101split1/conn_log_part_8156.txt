Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0 and ICMP protocol), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 13.213.75.44 and destination IP 163.45.191.104 for any other suspicious activity or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other protocol misuse. Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request traffic would be prudent.
