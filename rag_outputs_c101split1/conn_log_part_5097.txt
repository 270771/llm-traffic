Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connection attempts (S0 state) with no ICMP traffic entries. Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack. All connections are TCP SYN attempts without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not an ICMP flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for possible TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for repeated connection attempts from the same IPs and correlating with firewall or IDS logs is recommended.
