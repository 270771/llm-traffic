Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.192.82.251) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013222.3). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is a classic indicator of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" often labeled as a DoS attack.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection in many frameworks).
- Taxonomy class: "ICMP Flood" under DoS attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 3.192.82.251 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in the 157.206.x.x range (e.g., 157.206.63.2, 157.206.141.89, 157.206.251.61, etc.)
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.192.82.251.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are confirmed malicious.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
6. Conduct forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts part of a botnet or spoofed addresses.
