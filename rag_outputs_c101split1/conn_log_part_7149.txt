Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The traffic shows a single ICMP packet with no signs of flooding or repeated requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Requests (ICMP type 8) from the same source IP in a short time frame to confirm any potential ping flood. Monitor for high ICMP packet rates or repeated Echo Requests from 203.78.136.177 or other IPs.
