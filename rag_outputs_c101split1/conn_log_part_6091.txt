Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" (the 7th field after source and destination IP/port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between these hosts to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different ICMP misuse or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect future ping flood attempts.
