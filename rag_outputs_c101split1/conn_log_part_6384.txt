Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple TCP and UDP connection attempts, but no ICMP traffic entries are present. Specifically, there are no records with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The UDP and TCP traffic shown does not match the pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests typical of ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out ping flood per the known criteria.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts with S0 flags (indicating connection attempts without completion), which may suggest scanning or reconnaissance activity. Focus on IPs such as 89.247.69.146 and 89.247.69.180 that appear repeatedly in these attempts. Further analysis with IDS/IPS logs or packet captures could clarify if these represent a different attack type like SYN flood or port scanning.
