Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry involves ICMP traffic but does not specify type 8 (Echo Request), and the second entry shows ICMP type 8 from source IP 24.26.170.70 to destination 202.250.238.160. However, there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests indicative of a ping flood attack. The logs show only single or very limited ICMP connections without abnormal frequency or volume.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) alone do not confirm a ping flood unless accompanied by volume or rate anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 24.26.170.70 is repeatedly sending ICMP Echo Requests over a short time frame.  
- Enable rate-based detection or threshold alerts for ICMP traffic to detect potential flooding.
