Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 18.46.170.245, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single destination." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 18.46.170.245 (ICMP does not use ports)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.204.11, 133.227.201.8, 133.227.156.210, 133.227.156.132, 133.227.201.7, 133.227.244.254, 133.227.149.208, 133.227.198.248, 133.227.161.48, 133.227.201.2, 133.227.159.223, 133.227.204.7, 133.227.177.8, 133.227.224.1, 133.227.177.7, 133.227.156.187, 133.227.29.66, among others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 18.46.170.245.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily isolating or hardening the target host to maintain availability during mitigation.
