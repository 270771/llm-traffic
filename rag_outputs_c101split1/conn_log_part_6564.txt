Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates ICMP error messages rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may warrant investigation into network reachability or misconfiguration issues but does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to detect potential ping floods. Also, review network devices for ICMP error generation causes.
