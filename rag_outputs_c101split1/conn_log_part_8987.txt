Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 58 and 1, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. ICMP type 1 corresponds to destination unreachable messages, and type 58 is related to ICMPv6 neighbor discovery or other control messages, not echo requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match the known pattern for ping floods (ICMP type 8), no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of the ICMP type 1 messages to ensure they are not part of a different network issue or reconnaissance attempt.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If further anomalies appear, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify potential threats.
