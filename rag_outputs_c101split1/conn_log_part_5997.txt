Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the packet count is very low (96 packets over 1.999 seconds), which does not indicate a flood-level volume. The second entry shows ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request rates or volume from the same source IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
