Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy classes are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Typically, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with multiple SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.* and 167.46.181.*) for potential scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP logs separately to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Enable or verify ICMP logging in Zeek to capture relevant ICMP traffic for future detection.
