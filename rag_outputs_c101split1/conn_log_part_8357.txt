Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

The ICMP types observed correspond to:
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable
- Type 11: Time Exceeded

These types typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not a flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. However, the presence of ICMP error messages could warrant further investigation into network reachability or routing issues.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual traffic volume from these IPs. Investigate network devices for possible misconfigurations causing ICMP errors.
