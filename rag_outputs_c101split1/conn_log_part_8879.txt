Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types: 8, 1, 13, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the ICMP type 8 packets are very sparse (only two entries) and do not indicate a high volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood attack. The other ICMP types (1 = Echo Reply, 3 = Destination Unreachable, 13 = Timestamp Request) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of a flood pattern and no anomaly flags strongly suggests no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs, which could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp Request) traffic if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
