Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but there is no evidence of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP traffic indicative of a flood. The logs show only two isolated ICMP echo requests with no abnormal packet counts or durations suggesting flooding behavior.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood is detected, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood or denial-of-service activity.
