Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 202.244.71.197 to 91.238.113.8 with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this does not match a ping flood pattern.  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.143.78 to 182.44.233.1 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but the packet size and frequency (single entry with 32 bytes and 0.02 seconds duration) do not indicate flooding or high volume.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known attack heuristics apply here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP at high frequency or volume to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or unusual ICMP types that could indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
