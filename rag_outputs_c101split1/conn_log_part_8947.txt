Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 11 and 3 (the 4th field after source IP), which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP error messages, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is indicated.
