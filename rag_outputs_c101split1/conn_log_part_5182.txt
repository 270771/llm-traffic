Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, the fundamental condition for detecting a ping flood is not met.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports that no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.
- The traffic shows multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these TCP SYN attempts would be reconnaissance or scanning activity, not a flooding attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these TCP attempts are benign or part of a broader attack pattern.
