Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are control messages rather than flood attempts.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP traffic and no other suspicious indicators, no ping flood or related attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues such as routing problems or legitimate network diagnostics. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
