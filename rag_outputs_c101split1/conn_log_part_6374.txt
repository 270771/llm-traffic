Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of another reconnaissance or error-based attack. Monitoring for unusual volumes or patterns of these ICMP types could be warranted.
