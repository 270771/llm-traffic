Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "3" for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network issues or legitimate unreachable messages rather than an attack.

Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 traffic is generally classified as informational or diagnostic rather than malicious.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP type 3 messages that could indicate misconfiguration or network problems. Further investigation could include packet captures to verify ICMP message types and volumes.
