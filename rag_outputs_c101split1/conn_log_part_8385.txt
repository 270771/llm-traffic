Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 52.196.212.42 to multiple destination IPs, which is consistent with normal ping requests. However, the volume and timing do not indicate a flood pattern (e.g., extremely high frequency or large packet counts). Additionally, one entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this as an attack. Without evidence of excessive ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming targets, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 52.196.212.42 is known for scanning or reconnaissance activities.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
