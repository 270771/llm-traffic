Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 44.202.74.222.
- All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.
- The rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to a single target is a classic signature of a ping flood.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources targeting a single host.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 44.202.74.222 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.87.139, 133.243.72.78, 133.243.121.112, 133.243.29.65, 133.243.29.177, 133.243.123.255, 133.243.97.2, 133.243.146.247, 133.243.114.166, 133.243.114.6, 133.243.114.120, 133.243.98.151, 133.243.113.5, 133.243.189.169, among others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.74.222.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
