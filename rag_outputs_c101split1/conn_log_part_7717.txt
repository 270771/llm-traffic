Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 3, or 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which may relate to network errors or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts, but no immediate flooding mitigation is required.
