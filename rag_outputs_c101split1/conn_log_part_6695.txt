Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with type fields indicated by the two numeric columns after the source and destination IPs (values 3 and 0 in the examples). ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping). Here, the ICMP types are 3 and 0, which are not type 8. Type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply. Since none of the ICMP packets are Echo Requests, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or network issues.
