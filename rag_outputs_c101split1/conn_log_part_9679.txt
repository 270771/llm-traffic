Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from different source IPs (157.206.171.253, 157.206.154.189, 157.206.204.34, 157.206.126.243, 157.206.216.165, 157.206.216.221, 157.206.126.240) targeting a single destination IP (52.223.127.239) within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack."
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.206.171.253, 157.206.154.189, 157.206.204.34, 157.206.126.243, 157.206.216.165, 157.206.216.221, 157.206.126.240; Destination - 52.223.127.239; Port is 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious regions.
  4. Conduct a forensic analysis on the target host (52.223.127.239) for any service degradation or compromise.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
