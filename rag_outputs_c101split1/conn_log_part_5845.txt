Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "3" (the fourth field after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP Destination Unreachable message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this is normal ICMP error traffic.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but this is not a ping flood. Monitoring for actual ICMP type 8 floods or other anomalies is recommended.
