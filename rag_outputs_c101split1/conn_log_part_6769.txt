Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.149.140, 133.227.63.197, 133.227.212.255, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (44.202.241.89) in a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013210.94). This pattern of many sources sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic: multiple sources generating high-volume ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single victim to overwhelm network resources.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in the 133.227.x.x range targeting 44.202.241.89. ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the victim host and network for signs of resource exhaustion or service degradation.
  5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious or irrelevant regions.
  6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential compromised hosts within the source IP range to prevent future attacks.
