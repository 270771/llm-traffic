Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. While there are two ICMP type 8 packets from 151.105.96.5 to different destinations, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding (e.g., no rapid repeated requests or large packet counts). The third entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard knowledge:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high frequency.  
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if these IPs generate sustained high-rate ICMP traffic, which could indicate an emerging ping flood attack.
