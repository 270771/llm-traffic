Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP Echo Reply from 203.78.142.122 to 216.250.210.151, with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is a normal ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match other attack patterns such as ICMP flood or reconnaissance.

No immediate security response is required, but continued monitoring of ICMP traffic for repeated Echo Requests (type 8) at high rates is recommended to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
