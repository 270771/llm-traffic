Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the first record shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), the second and third records show types 0 and 10, none of which correspond to ICMP Echo Request (type 8) used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 10 (Router Advertisement) suggests normal network diagnostic or routing traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 sending ICMP type 11 packets to ensure no routing loops or misconfigurations exist.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
