Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.17.177.6) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 3.17.177.6 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.147.175, 133.243.147.238, 133.243.163.2, 133.243.106.186, and others from the 133.243.x.x subnet.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.17.177.6.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are confirmed malicious.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and prepare to apply blackhole routing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
5. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing to prevent further attacks.
