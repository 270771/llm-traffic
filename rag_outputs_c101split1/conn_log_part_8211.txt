Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.  
- Since no ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- The connections show mostly SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding via ICMP.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy can be made.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion (S0) as this may indicate a TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning or SYN flood detection if available.  
- Monitor for any sudden appearance of ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
