Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP type 3 traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.227.159.37, 203.78.142.57) for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious behavior, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal a developing ping flood attack.
