Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 1 and 0 (fields 4 and 10 correspond to ICMP type and code, respectively). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not represent ping requests and therefore do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be ICMP messages of other types (likely destination unreachable or echo reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP types further to ensure they are legitimate control messages and not part of another ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent to detect any future ping flood attempts.
