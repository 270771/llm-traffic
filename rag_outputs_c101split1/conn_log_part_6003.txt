Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping traffic relevant to a ping flood.  
- In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines 1 and 2), but the packet counts (192 and 32) and durations (0.351618s and 0.109866s) do not indicate an overwhelming volume typical of a ping flood attack.  
- The third entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references can be made. However, the absence of high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags strongly suggests no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic if it is unexpected, as it may indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic volumes to better detect anomalies in the future.
