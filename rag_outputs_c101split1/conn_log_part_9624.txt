Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.17.112.111) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 34.17.112.111 (ICMP type 8, no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.225.193, 133.243.194.124, 133.243.161.190, 133.243.225.249, 133.243.241.215, 133.243.91.2, 133.243.222.142, 133.243.222.6, 133.243.121.6, 133.243.192.71, 133.243.24.5, 133.243.100.234, 133.243.194.228, 133.243.153.148.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 34.17.112.111.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily isolating the affected host or segment to preserve availability while mitigation is underway.
