Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 18.46.170.245 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.227.x.x range (e.g., 133.227.234.201, 133.227.164.6, 133.227.154.253, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 18.46.170.245 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to reduce the flood impact.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.227.0.0/16 if they are not trusted.
- Monitor the target host 18.46.170.245 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential sources of ICMP floods and update firewall rules accordingly.
