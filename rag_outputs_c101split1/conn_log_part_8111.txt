Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 0 or missing (indicated by 0 or “-”), but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 means this traffic is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 0 traffic (likely echo replies) and other ICMP types present to rule out other ICMP-based anomalies or reconnaissance. Monitoring for unusual ICMP volume or patterns could be useful, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
