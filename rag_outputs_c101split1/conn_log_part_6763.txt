Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the "3" and "1" fields after IPs and ports; specifically, the 6th and 7th fields are 3 and 1, where 3 is the source port and 1 is the destination port, but for ICMP these represent ICMP type and code. Here, the ICMP type is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 3 messages could be useful to detect network issues or other ICMP-based attacks.
