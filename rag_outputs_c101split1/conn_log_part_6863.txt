Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single record with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 203.78.143.78 to 64.171.255.2, but it shows only one connection with a duration of 0.320 seconds and 32 bytes transferred, which does not indicate flooding or high volume.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are unrelated to ping floods and suggest normal network error messages or diagnostics.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics look for high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is not present here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if they persist or increase, as they may indicate network issues or other types of scanning or misconfigurations.
