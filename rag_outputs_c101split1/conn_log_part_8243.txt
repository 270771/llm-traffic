Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the logs show only single or very few packets (last field is 1), indicating isolated pings rather than a flood. A ping flood would manifest as a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without additional data indicating volume or repeated rapid ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these isolated pings correlate with other suspicious activity or scanning behavior.  
- If volume spikes, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood."

Currently, no attack is present.
