Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `1` (ICMP code field is `1`), which corresponds to an ICMP destination unreachable message, not an echo request (type 8). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.157.48 and destination IP 212.220.216.196 for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based issues, as ICMP type 1 messages can indicate network errors or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
