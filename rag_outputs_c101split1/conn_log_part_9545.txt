Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be indicated by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the provided snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No entries show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) and various TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) indicate scanning or connection attempts but not ICMP ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping floods applies.
- The TCP SYN attempts (S0) could be related to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically heuristic #6 (SYN scan) in common taxonomies.
- UDP traffic on port 5060 may be SIP-related and could be investigated for SIP flooding or scanning but not ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets to port 5060 for potential SIP abuse or scanning.
- Monitor TCP SYN attempts for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Collect ICMP-specific logs or enable ICMP type and code logging to detect future ping flood attempts.
