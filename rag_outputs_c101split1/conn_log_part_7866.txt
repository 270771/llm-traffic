Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) involves two connections: from 133.243.189.129 to 23.252.93.253, and from 133.243.189.160 to 104.120.231.255. Both show zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no flood-level volume or sustained traffic. The other ICMP entry with type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior. Given the low volume and lack of repeated ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require high-rate ICMP type 8 packets.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from these IPs. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts.
