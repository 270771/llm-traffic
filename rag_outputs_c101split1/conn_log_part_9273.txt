Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP traffic, especially with type 8 (Echo Request), is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The traffic mostly shows failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), but these do not match ping flood characteristics.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Establish heuristics to flag high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic for early detection of ping floods.
