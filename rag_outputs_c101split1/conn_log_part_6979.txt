Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 13, 0, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the ICMP type 8 packets are isolated and do not show signs of flooding such as high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame. The entries have connection states marked as OTH (other), and packet counts are very low (mostly 0 or 1), indicating no sustained flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP.  
- Investigate the source IPs 172.23.68.231 and 133.227.214.164 if they begin sending repeated echo requests.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts for potential ICMP-based DoS activity.
