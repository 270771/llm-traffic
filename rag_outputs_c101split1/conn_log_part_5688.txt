Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but the ICMP type field (the fourth field after source IP and port) is mostly 3, 8, or 11. Only one entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, there is only a single echo request record (213.217.188.222 â†’ 133.105.128.253), and no evidence of a high volume or rapid repetition of ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = destination unreachable, 11 = time exceeded) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If heuristics were available, a ping flood would typically be flagged under a heuristic related to ICMP echo request rate anomalies and classified under a denial-of-service (DoS) taxonomy.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate the source IP 213.217.188.222 for unusual ICMP echo request behavior over time. Also, review network baseline traffic to detect any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests that could indicate an emerging ping flood.
