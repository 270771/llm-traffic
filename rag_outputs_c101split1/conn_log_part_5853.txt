Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of anomalies and the ICMP type mismatch, no attack is present.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs to rule out ping floods. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving these IPs.
