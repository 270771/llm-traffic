Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is observable.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.
- Monitor for sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests from single IPs.
- Enable or review Zeekâ€™s ICMP logging to capture relevant data for ping flood detection.
