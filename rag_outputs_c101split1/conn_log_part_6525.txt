Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 13 packets to determine if there is any unusual timestamp request activity that could indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based probing.
