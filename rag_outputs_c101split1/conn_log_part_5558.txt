Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or intrusion attempts. Also, monitor ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood activity.
