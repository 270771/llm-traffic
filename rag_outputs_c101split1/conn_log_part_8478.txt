Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a small set of destination IPs, notably 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223. The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs to the same destination IPs strongly match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves overwhelming a target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with a classic ICMP flood heuristic, which would be assigned a heuristic number such as "H1: ICMP Flood Detection."  
- The taxonomy class is "Network Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP flood attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.159.19, 133.243.220.11, 157.206.228.137, 157.206.158.247, 157.206.116.194, and others.  
- Destination IPs: Primarily 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.  
4. Consider blacklisting persistent attacking source IPs at firewall or router level.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
