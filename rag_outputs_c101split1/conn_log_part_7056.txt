Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target, which is not indicated here.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in other logs or over time from the same source IP (202.244.71.197) to the destination (185.239.88.3). Monitoring for volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets is essential to detect potential ping floods.
