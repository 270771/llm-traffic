Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first entry (type 11) corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and the second entry (type 3) corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which may indicate network issues or other non-flood conditions.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. However, these ICMP types could warrant further investigation into network routing or reachability problems.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP error messages from these IPs (112.169.168.146, 163.45.165.171, 203.78.132.118, 141.226.52.144) to rule out other network issues or reconnaissance activity.
