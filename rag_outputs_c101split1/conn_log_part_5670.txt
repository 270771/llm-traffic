Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 11, 3, and 13. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 13 (Timestamp) indicate normal ICMP control or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a network scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts promptly.
