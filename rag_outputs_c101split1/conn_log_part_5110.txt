Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.
- Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or other network telemetry to confirm scanning behavior.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
