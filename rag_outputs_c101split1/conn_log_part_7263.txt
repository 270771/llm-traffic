Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP connection with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 163.45.158.76, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 13 corresponds to Timestamp Requests, which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods. If volume spikes or multiple rapid Echo Requests are observed, further investigation should be initiated.
