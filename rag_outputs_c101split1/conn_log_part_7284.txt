Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is observable.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP packets with type 8.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
- Continue monitoring TCP/UDP traffic for other attack types such as SYN floods or port scans, as many TCP connections show SYN_SENT (S0) states but no clear flooding pattern.
