Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 133.215.16.70 to destination 157.79.163.99, with a single packet and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 13 (Timestamp Request), which do not qualify as ping floods since only type 8 is relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There is no anomaly data or heuristic context provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- Typically, a ping flood heuristic would involve detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the timestamp request packets (type 13) if unusual volume or patterns emerge, as they may indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based activity.
