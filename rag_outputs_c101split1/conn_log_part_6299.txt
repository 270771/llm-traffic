Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP types 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first entry (ICMP type 11) corresponds to a Time Exceeded message, and the second entry (ICMP type 3) corresponds to a Destination Unreachable message. These are normal ICMP control messages and do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, these ICMP messages could be part of network troubleshooting or normal error reporting.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out network misconfigurations or routing issues. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
