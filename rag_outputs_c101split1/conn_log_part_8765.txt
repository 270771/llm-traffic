Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `13`, which corresponds to an ICMP timestamp request, not an echo request (type 8) used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, which may warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Investigate the nature and frequency of ICMP type 13 traffic between these IPs to rule out reconnaissance or other ICMP-based probing activities. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
