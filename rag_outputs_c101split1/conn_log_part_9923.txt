Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern can be identified.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic mostly consists of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts for potential port scanning or brute force activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context. Also, enable or verify ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
