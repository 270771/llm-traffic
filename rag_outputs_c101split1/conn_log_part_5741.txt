Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the entries show ICMP types 0 and 13, which correspond to Echo Reply and Timestamp Request respectively, not the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood (ICMP type 8) is not met, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references can be made. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Requests) and type 0 (Echo Replies) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or timing-based attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If unusual volumes of ICMP type 13 or other types persist, consider deeper packet inspection or correlation with other logs to rule out covert timing attacks or misconfigurations.
