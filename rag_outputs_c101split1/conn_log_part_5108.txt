Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not observed at all, the condition for a ping flood is not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, SYN scans or connection attempts typically fall under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics in common taxonomies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP Echo Requests to catch future ping floods.
