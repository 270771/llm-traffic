Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a host.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags and failures (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the S0 state in Zeek typically corresponds to connection attempts without successful completion, often related to reconnaissance or scanning.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.180) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any unusual ICMP traffic not captured here.
