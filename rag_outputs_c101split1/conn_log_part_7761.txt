Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the log entries are mostly not 8 (Echo Request). For example, types 0, 3, 8, 10, and 11 appear, but only one entry shows type 8 (Echo Request) with very low frequency and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from a single source to a target. A ping flood requires a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of other ICMP types (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded) suggests normal network diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume or repeated requests from the same source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP-based DoS attacks.
