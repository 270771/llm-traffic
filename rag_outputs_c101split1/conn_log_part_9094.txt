Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping flood traffic.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic consists of ICMP error messages rather than echo requests, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of these ICMP error messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
