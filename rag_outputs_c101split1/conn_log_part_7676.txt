Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the volume and frequency of these packets do not indicate a flood. The first entry shows a single ICMP echo request from 203.78.143.78 to 178.255.65.2 with 240 bytes, and the second entry is a single ICMP echo request from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.146. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from one source to one destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request rates from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs or network telemetry show repeated ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.  
- If a sudden spike in ICMP traffic occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using volume and rate heuristics.
