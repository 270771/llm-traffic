Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP code field shows 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 1 traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity, which could warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.194.66 for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
