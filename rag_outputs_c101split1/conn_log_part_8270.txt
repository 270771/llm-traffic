Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.250.216.227 and destination IP 167.46.181.22 for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect possible future ping floods.
