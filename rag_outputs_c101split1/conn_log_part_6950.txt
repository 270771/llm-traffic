Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without further data, no specific attack can be identified.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.108.248 and destination IP 120.75.231.41 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior over time, focusing on ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.
