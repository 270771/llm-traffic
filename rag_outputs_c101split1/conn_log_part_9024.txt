Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.74.222) from many different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all within milliseconds).
- This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target IP matches the classic behavior of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a victim with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.
- The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, which is a prerequisite for ping flood detection.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target**.
- The taxonomy class is **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 44.202.74.222 (destination of all ICMP Echo Requests)
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.126.190, 133.243.121.56, 133.243.255.93, 133.243.56.126, 133.243.72.146, 133.243.56.124, 133.243.242.182, 133.243.97.23, 133.243.24.9, 133.243.111.110, 133.243.192.73
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.74.222.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP addresses if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
