Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the packet count is only 224 packets over approximately 0.82 seconds, which does not strongly indicate a flood-level volume. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request rates or repeated patterns from the same source IPs. If volume spikes significantly or multiple sources coordinate, re-evaluate for potential ICMP flood or other denial-of-service attacks.
