Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.249.88.129) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds). All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is a volumetric ICMP flood detection heuristic (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 54.249.88.129
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x subnet
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports applicable for ICMP

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from 54.249.88.129 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods from this or other sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP anomaly detection signatures or traffic shaping.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
