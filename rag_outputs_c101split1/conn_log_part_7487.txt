Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 10, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," neither of which are used in ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this traffic is normal or related to other network functions.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.250.250.10 and 157.206.194.43) for unusual volume or patterns in other logs.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules to ensure ICMP echo requests are properly logged and alerted on.
