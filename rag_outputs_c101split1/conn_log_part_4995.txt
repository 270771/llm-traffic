Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field is `tcp`), with no ICMP traffic present. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP connection attempts with `S0` state (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP traffic to confirm no hidden ping flood attempts.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
