Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 133.105.8.63, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests for volume spikes or repeated patterns from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) is recommended as a next step to detect potential future ping floods.
