Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). The second entry has ICMP type 11, which is a time exceeded message, not related to ping floods. However, there is only one ICMP echo request recorded, and no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack heuristic focused on ICMP echo request floods.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP address. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood DoS activity. Also, review network device logs and traffic patterns for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
