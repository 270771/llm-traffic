Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is not composed of ICMP Echo Requests, it does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in other logs or over time to detect potential ping floods. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving these IPs.
