Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type is not explicitly listed as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The first entry has ICMP with no type specified, and the second entry shows ICMP with a last field value of 1, which corresponds to ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection states are OTH (other), indicating incomplete or unusual connection states but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 193.7.130.247 sending ICMP type 1 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in logs for precise detection.
