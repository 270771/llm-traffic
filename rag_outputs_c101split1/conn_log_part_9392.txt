Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3` respectively, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues.  
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network or host unreachable errors.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP behavior:

- ICMP type 11 and 3 messages are typically not indicative of a ping flood but may suggest network misconfigurations or other issues worth monitoring.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (133.243.19.170 and 157.206.194.1) for potential network scanning or misconfiguration causing excessive ICMP error messages. Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that could indicate other types of reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
