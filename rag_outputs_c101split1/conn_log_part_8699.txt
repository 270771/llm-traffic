Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it cannot be a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single connection record, not indicative of a flood or high-volume ICMP echo requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination or a high volume of such traffic, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once more data or anomaly context is available.
