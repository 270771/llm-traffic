Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections. Only two have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection.  
- However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding. For example, the last entry shows only 1 packet with 28 bytes, which is low and not consistent with a flood.  
- The first entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 3 traffic typically relates to network errors, not attacks.  
- ICMP type 8 traffic here appears normal and low volume.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context for better detection.
