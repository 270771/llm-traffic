Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high number of TCP connection attempts with S0 state flags, as these may indicate port scanning or probing. Focus on IPs with repeated failed connection attempts to identify potential reconnaissance or intrusion attempts. Consider enabling or reviewing IDS/IPS alerts for scanning heuristics and monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
