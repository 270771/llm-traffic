Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets all targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013227.416xxx). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 163.84.73.84 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.234.251, 157.206.156.25, 157.206.81.31, 133.243.113.63, 130.187.49.1, 157.206.59.249, 133.243.18.245, 133.243.119.248, 130.187.3.240, 157.206.170.253, 133.243.107.15, 130.187.20.251, 133.243.26.14, 130.187.28.25, 157.206.21.17, 157.206.81.18, 133.243.255.243, 157.206.164.195, 157.206.127.212, 157.206.156.60, 133.243.254.222  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.  
4. Monitor the victim host (163.84.73.84) for service degradation or resource exhaustion and prepare for potential escalation.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if attack volume increases.  
6. Log and alert on continued or escalating ICMP Echo Request floods for incident response escalation.
