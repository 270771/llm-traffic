Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 65.148.121.107 to 203.78.188.249 and 143.187.187.184 to 163.45.254.218, but there is no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination that would suggest flooding.  
- Other ICMP types present (11, 3) are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- The log snippet shows single or very few ICMP connections, not a flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency.  
- Investigate if any source IPs generate a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests over a short time window, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume and alerts from IDS/IPS systems for further confirmation.
