Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type as 0 (indicated by the field after the protocol, which is 0 in all cases), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent legitimate traffic or other ICMP message types (e.g., Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable). Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs would be prudent to detect future ping flood attempts.
