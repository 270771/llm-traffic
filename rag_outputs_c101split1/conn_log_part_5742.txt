Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 0 indicates Echo Reply, which are normal control messages or responses, not flooding attempts.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. Given the lack of suspicious volume or type 8 ICMP packets, no immediate attack is evident.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated requests from the same source IPs (163.45.185.89, 203.78.140.213) to the same destination IPs. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
