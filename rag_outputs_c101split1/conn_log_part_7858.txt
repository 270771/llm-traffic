Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for broader context.
