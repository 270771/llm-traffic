Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log snippet is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 traffic could indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 and destination IP 43.243.65.61 for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-related anomalies. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
