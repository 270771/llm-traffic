Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging and monitoring to capture Echo Requests and Replies.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP volume or patterns.
