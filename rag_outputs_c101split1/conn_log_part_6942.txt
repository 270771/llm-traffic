Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume shown is minimal (only single packets logged), and the connection state is OTH (other), indicating no established flow or repeated attempts. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one source to a destination that would indicate a flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific classification. Given the lack of volume and frequency, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which typically involve a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets overwhelming a target.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. If a surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign scanning activity.
