Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type can be confidently inferred.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to detect any potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks. Also, monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or other connection anomalies since many TCP connections show SYN_SENT (S0) states, which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activity.
