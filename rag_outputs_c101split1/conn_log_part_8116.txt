Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No high volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to assign specific heuristic numbers or taxonomy classes. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks such as smurf or ICMP flood variants.
