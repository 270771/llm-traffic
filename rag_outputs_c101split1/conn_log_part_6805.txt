Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP, 35.83.191.13, sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps clustered around 1641013211). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm network resources by saturating them with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, the behavior matches common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range (e.g., 163.45.213.1, 163.45.99.182, 163.45.13.218, etc.)  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request), code: 0 (standard ping)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13.  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.  
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source IP for potential upstream filtering or blackholing.  
4. Deploy or verify existing Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.  
5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood detection and mitigation steps.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to assess impact and improve detection heuristics.
