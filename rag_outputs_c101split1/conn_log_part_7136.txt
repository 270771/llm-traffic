Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or other reconnaissance. Focus on IPs such as 89.247.69.146 and 89.247.69.153 that appear repeatedly as sources. Apply heuristics related to scanning and reconnaissance once available.
