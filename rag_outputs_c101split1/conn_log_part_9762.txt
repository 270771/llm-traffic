Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 157.206.167.237 to 52.223.127.239 with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated Echo Requests (type 8), this does not match ping flood behavior.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 from 54.249.88.129 to 163.45.138.214, but it is a single connection log entry without evidence of high volume or flooding patterns.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP traffic observed does not indicate a flood or other known ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP Echo Requests increase significantly or if other anomalies appear in connection logs.
