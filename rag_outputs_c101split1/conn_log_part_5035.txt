Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without ICMP traffic or relevant anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP echo requests are present.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as the current logs show many TCP connection attempts with S0 (connection attempt without response) states, which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood detection if available.
