Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 0 further to determine if it relates to other ICMP-based activities or errors. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the involved IPs (133.227.58.122 and 222.65.160.47) to detect potential future ping floods.
