Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is the 4th column after source IP and port (in Zeek conn.log, the ICMP type is the field immediately after the destination port).  
- In the provided entries, the ICMP types are 11, 11, and 3 respectively. None of these are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, neither of which indicate a ping flood.  
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP control messages or error messages.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- If further investigation is desired, focus should be on monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume spikes or other anomalies in ICMP echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic for type 8 packets with high frequency from single or multiple sources.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
