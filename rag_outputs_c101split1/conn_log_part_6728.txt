Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates an ICMP error message rather than a flood of ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific classification can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why the destination unreachable messages are generatedâ€”check for possible network misconfigurations or routing issues between 157.206.194.66 and 167.246.129.103. Monitor for any increase in ICMP error messages that could indicate a broader network problem.
