Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no ICMP records present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means the traffic does not match the known pattern for ping floods.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the TCP SYN packets with S0 flags (connection attempts without response), this traffic may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, which could warrant further investigation for reconnaissance activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present elsewhere.
