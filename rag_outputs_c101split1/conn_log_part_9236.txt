Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records are found and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 3 traffic suggests possible network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.45.185.70 sending ICMP type 3 messages for possible misconfigurations or scanning behavior.
