Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here the value is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.159.37 and destination IP 94.255.28.242 for potential network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies, focusing on the nature of ICMP type 1 messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
