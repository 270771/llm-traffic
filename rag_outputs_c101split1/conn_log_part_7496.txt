Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet count is low (432 bytes, 0 retransmissions), indicating no flooding behavior.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of ICMP Timestamp Requests between 157.206.153.121 and 93.174.196.38 to rule out reconnaissance or misconfiguration, but no immediate threat is indicated.
