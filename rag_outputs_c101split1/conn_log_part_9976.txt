Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The heuristic and taxonomy for ping flood attacks typically rely on detecting high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets, which is not the case here.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP-based anomalies exist. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP activity to rule out stealthy ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
