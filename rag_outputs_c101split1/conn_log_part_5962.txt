Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 3 and 1, with only a few entries showing type 8. Specifically, the entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are from source IP 143.187.187.164 to various destinations, but the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 1 = Echo Reply) are not indicative of ping flood attacks. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), and the log shows mixed ICMP types with no overwhelming number of type 8 packets, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 and 1 traffic typically relates to network diagnostics or error messages, not flooding attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 143.187.187.164 for unusual ICMP Echo Request activity over a longer time window to confirm no slow-rate or low-volume ping attempts. Also, monitor for any spikes in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate emerging ping flood behavior.
