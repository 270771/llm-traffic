Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 from 143.5.202.233 to 133.105.93.34, which is an echo request (ping).  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0 from 133.243.206.29 to 63.82.56.179, which is an echo reply, not a ping request.  
- Neither entry shows a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The presence of type 0 (echo reply) packets does not indicate a ping flood, as only type 8 (echo request) packets are relevant for ping flood detection.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.
