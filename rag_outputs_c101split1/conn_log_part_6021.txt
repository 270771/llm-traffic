Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 13 (Timestamp), 3 (Destination Unreachable), 0 (Echo Reply), and 1 (Destination Unreachable). Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack classifications.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or other types of ICMP misuse, such as ICMP unreachable or timestamp messages, which could indicate reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in future logs is recommended to detect potential ping floods.
