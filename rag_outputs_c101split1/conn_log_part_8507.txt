Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 2 or 3 or 11 (indicated by the 4th and 8th fields, which correspond to ICMP type/code). None have ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Therefore, these are not echo requests but other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, time exceeded), which do not constitute a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal or other diagnostic ICMP messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) and type 3 (destination unreachable) messages to ensure they are not part of a different reconnaissance or network scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If suspicious patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source IP.
