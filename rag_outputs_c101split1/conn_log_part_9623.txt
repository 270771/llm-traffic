Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.125.147, 133.243.192.73, 133.243.206.21, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination IP (34.17.112.111) in a very short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one host is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: DoS/Disruption.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 34.17.112.111 (receiving the flood).
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.125.147, 133.243.192.73, 133.243.206.21, 133.243.206.29, 133.243.125.20, 133.243.229.182, 133.243.24.9, 133.243.224.57, 133.243.24.7, 133.243.194.181.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 34.17.112.111.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
