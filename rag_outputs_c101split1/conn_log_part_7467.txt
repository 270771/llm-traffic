Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 58.222.108.6, with a single packet and no signs of flooding (no high packet count or rapid repeated requests). The other entries with ICMP type 3 are destination unreachable messages, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 messages for possible network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If suspicious ICMP traffic patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests") and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
