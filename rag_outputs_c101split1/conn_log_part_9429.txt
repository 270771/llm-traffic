Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.  
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), typical of scanning or failed connection attempts, not ICMP flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.  
- The connection attempts could be indicative of reconnaissance or scanning activity, which generally falls under heuristic classes related to network scanning or reconnaissance, not flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154 to multiple targets, as this could indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or use packet capture to verify if any ICMP echo requests are present outside this snippet.
