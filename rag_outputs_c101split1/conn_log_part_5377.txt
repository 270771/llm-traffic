Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, heuristic #1 might relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS" (Denial of Service) would apply to ping floods.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled. Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods. Also, review TCP SYN scan patterns for possible reconnaissance activity.
