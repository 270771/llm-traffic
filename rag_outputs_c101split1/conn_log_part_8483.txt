Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 44.198.161.223, from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013226.21xxxx). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "high volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," which typically falls under a Denial of Service (DoS) taxonomy.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.206.x.x range (e.g., 157.206.232.148, 157.206.249.220, 157.206.163.19, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 44.198.161.223 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the target host 44.198.161.223 for service degradation or outages.
3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., ICMP flood thresholds, anomaly detection).
4. Investigate whether the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet and coordinate with upstream providers for source mitigation.
5. Consider deploying blackhole routing or scrubbing services if the attack volume escalates.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, ICMP type, and target concentration.
