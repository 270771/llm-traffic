Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (the destination port field is 0, and the ICMP type field is 0), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 202.155.27.46 and 202.250.197.168 to determine if it is part of another ICMP-based anomaly or misconfiguration. Collect additional logs to identify any abnormal volume or patterns.
