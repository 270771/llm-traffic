Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single packet with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious activity here.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and patterns continuously is recommended to detect any future flooding attempts.
