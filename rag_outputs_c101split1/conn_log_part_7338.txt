Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages between 133.243.115.209 and 101.83.117.39, as frequent Destination Unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.
