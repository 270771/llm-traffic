Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which is an Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate floodingâ€”only a single packet with a duration of 1.4 seconds and 168 bytes is logged. The second entry is ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of repeated or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high traffic, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs (e.g., 133.243.6.38) to the same destination IPs (e.g., 185.61.2.202).  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP error messages (type 1) that might indicate other network issues or attacks.
