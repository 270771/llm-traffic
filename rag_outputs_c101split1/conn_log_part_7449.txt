Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP type values of 11 (Time Exceeded) and 0 (Echo Reply), but no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types suggest diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 packets (Time Exceeded) to ensure no routing loops or misconfigurations are causing excessive ICMP errors.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
