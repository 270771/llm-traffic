Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs or other network captures to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests are present. Monitoring for high-rate ICMP type 8 packets is necessary to detect ping flood attacks.
