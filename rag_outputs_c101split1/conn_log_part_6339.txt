Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for identifying ping flood attacks. This traffic represents a single ICMP echo reply from 133.105.53.223 to 115.199.156.169, not a flood of echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Also, consider enabling detailed ICMP traffic logging and threshold-based alerts for high ICMP echo request rates.
