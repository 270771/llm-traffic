Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th field after the source IP and port. Here, the ICMP types observed are `0` and `8`. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods. However, the entries with ICMP type 8 show only single connections from source IP `151.105.96.5` to two different destination IPs (`133.105.230.82` and `133.105.230.81`), each with a single packet (`-` in the packet count fields and `1` in the last field indicating one connection). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

The other entry with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from `133.243.206.29` to `104.121.237.6` is not relevant for ping flood detection since replies alone do not indicate an attack.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of volume and pattern rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination.  
- Investigate if any other anomalies or unusual traffic patterns emerge involving these IPs.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes significantly, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high volume ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ DDoS - ICMP Flood."
