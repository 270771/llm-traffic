Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates ICMP error messages rather than a flood of ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific classification can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 traffic typically relates to network diagnostics or error reporting, not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP error messages that could indicate scanning or misconfiguration. Further investigation should focus on traffic volume and patterns from these IPs to rule out other network issues.
