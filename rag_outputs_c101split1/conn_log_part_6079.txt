Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `1` (indicated by the source port field for ICMP, which is `1`), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but not a flood of echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of echo request traffic and no anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 1 messages are being generated between these IPs, as frequent destination unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
