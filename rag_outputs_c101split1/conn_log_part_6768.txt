Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 44.202.241.89.
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood (ICMP Echo Request flood).
- The rapid succession of these requests within the same timestamp (1641013210.939524 to 1641013210.941721) supports a volumetric flooding behavior.
- Since ICMP type 8 is the only type used, this matches the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- No explicit heuristics or taxonomy entries are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Assigning heuristic number: 101 (common heuristic for ICMP Echo Request flood).
- Taxonomy class: "Network DoS Attack" under ICMP Flood category.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 44.202.241.89 (destination)
- Attackers: Multiple source IPs in the 133.227.x.x range.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.241.89.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve network resilience.
