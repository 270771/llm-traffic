Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and no ICMP traffic is logged here, no ping flood can be detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, there is no evidence of any other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to detect any potential ping flood or other ICMP-based anomalies. Also, monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, as the current TCP entries show many SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts worth further analysis.
