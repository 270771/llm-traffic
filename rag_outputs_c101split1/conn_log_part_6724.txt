Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (codes 11, 3, and 11 correspond to ICMP types other than 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly indicators, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP messages (types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, respectively) to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
