Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The S0 state in Zeek conn.log typically indicates SYN packets without successful connection establishment, often related to scanning or reconnaissance.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.153 on port 8080) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP traffic spikes.
