Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol number 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance and taxonomy class "Network Scanning."

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion to confirm if a port scan or reconnaissance is occurring. Correlate with other logs (e.g., ICMP logs, firewall logs) to detect any other attack types.
