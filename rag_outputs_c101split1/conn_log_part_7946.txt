Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal connection attempts or failed TCP handshakes (S0 flags), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IPs.  
- Apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once ICMP data is available, such as monitoring for excessive ICMP echo requests per second from a single IP.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned. Typically, ping flood attacks fall under DoS (Denial of Service) heuristics focused on ICMP traffic anomalies.
