Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the first two entries show ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the third entry shows ICMP type 10 (likely a Timestamp Reply or other non-echo type). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) often relates to traceroute or routing issues, not attacks, and type 10 is unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.177 and 130.187.28.17) for unusual ICMP activity or other anomalies, as repeated ICMP Time Exceeded messages could indicate network misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
