Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `3` (destination unreachable), not `8` (echo request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 3 indicates error messages rather than a flood attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there are ICMP destination unreachable messages between 203.78.136.169 and 162.113.225.119, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or connectivity issues, but it is not indicative of a ping flood.
