Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 35.72.129.52, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013236.11). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP type 8, no ports applicable)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.116.253, 133.243.222.142, 133.243.116.147, 133.243.232.149, 133.243.241.249, 133.243.31.38, 133.243.29.177, 133.243.135.184, 133.243.80.11, 133.243.80.192, 133.243.29.54, 133.243.232.127, 133.243.232.94, 133.243.135.180, 133.243.31.0, 133.243.195.186.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52.
2. Identify and isolate the source IPs if they are internal or under your control; if external, coordinate with upstream ISPs for mitigation.
3. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts and adjust firewall rules accordingly.
5. Consider applying geo-blocking or blacklisting if source IPs are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.
6. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential service degradation or outage due to the attack.
