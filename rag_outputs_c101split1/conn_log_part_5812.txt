Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0, which for ICMP corresponds to type/code fields), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no established session, consistent with isolated ICMP replies or unrelated ICMP traffic.

No heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned due to lack of data. Further investigation should focus on verifying ICMP type fields in raw packet captures to confirm traffic nature and monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from this or other sources.
