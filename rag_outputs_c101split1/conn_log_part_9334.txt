Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet is logged, which is insufficient to indicate flooding or a volumetric attack pattern.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 192.207.220.247 if it sends multiple echo requests in rapid succession.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high-frequency ICMP echo requests for future detection.
