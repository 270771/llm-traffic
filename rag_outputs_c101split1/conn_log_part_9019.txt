Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.184.1, 133.243.163.19, 133.227.153.41, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 44.202.74.222 and 54.196.70.79) in a very short time window (~milliseconds).
- This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests rapidly to the same targets matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**.
- Taxonomy class: **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple internal IPs in the 133.227.x.x and 133.243.x.x ranges.
- Destination IPs: 44.202.74.222 and 54.196.70.79.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
4. Deploy network-based anomaly detection to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent attacking IPs.
6. Review internal host configurations to prevent them from participating in amplification or reflection attacks if these sources are internal.

This targeted and rapid response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood and protect network availability.
