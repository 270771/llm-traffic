Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or network diagnostic traffic, these entries may represent normal or benign network behavior.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 11 messages to rule out potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive Time Exceeded messages. If a high rate is observed, further network path analysis is recommended.
