Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 0, 1, or 11, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic appears to be other ICMP message types (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded), which are normal network control messages or error responses.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP error messages, as excessive ICMP error traffic can indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- If suspicious traffic volumes or patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or denial-of-service as per your internal taxonomy.
