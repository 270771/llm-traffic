Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single entry with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious activity.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristics or taxonomy data are available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 indicates normal network diagnostic or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination at high frequency, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.245.141 if multiple echo requests continue or increase in volume.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for potential emerging threats.
