Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple echo requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs to rule out ping floods. Monitor for any unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving 151.105.96.5 or 133.105.230.99.
