Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The absence of ICMP entries means no evidence of ping flood or any other ICMP-based attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The traffic mostly consists of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not flooding.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class applies.
- TCP SYN attempts without completion (S0) typically relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, often labeled as "Network Scanning" or "Reconnaissance" in taxonomy.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN attempts (S0) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for suspicious patterns on the involved IPs and ports.
