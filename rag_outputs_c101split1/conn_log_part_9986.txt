Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the single destination IP 44.194.4.248 with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages (ping). The high number of distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time frame strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 44.194.4.248 (no port, ICMP protocol)  
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.227.x.x subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 44.194.4.248.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse within the 133.227.0.0/16 network.  
4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic destined to 44.194.4.248 temporarily to mitigate impact.  
5. Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
