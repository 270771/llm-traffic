Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the port field being 0, which typically represents ICMP type/code in Zeek logs), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets with OTH (other) state, not indicative of flooding or scanning.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they are legitimate replies (type 0 = Echo Reply) or unrelated ICMP traffic. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or volume spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
