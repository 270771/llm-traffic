Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port field (11) and destination port field (0). For ICMP traffic, the source port typically represents the ICMP type. Here, the source port is 11, which corresponds to ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 is commonly related to network diagnostics or traceroute, not attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 11 packets to rule out potential network scanning or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a ping flood.
