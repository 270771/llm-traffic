Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Since ICMP type 13 is generally benign or used for network diagnostics, no immediate threat is indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated high-volume ICMP packets from the same source IP (219.123.60.52) to the destination (202.250.197.144) to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
