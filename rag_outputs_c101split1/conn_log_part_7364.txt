Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it cannot be a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single event without evidence of high volume or flooding patterns. No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned. Generally, ping floods require multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one or more sources targeting a victim, which is not observed here.

Next Steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If a surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 message for possible network issues or misconfigurations.
