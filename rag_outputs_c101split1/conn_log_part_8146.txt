Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first two entries show ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings). However, the third entry has ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, not an echo request. More importantly, the volume and pattern of the ICMP echo requests do not indicate a floodâ€”there are only two echo request entries with different source IPs targeting the same destination IP, and no high-frequency repetition or volume is evident from the snippet.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns. Without evidence of sustained, high-rate ICMP echo requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a single destination, this traffic does not match a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The third entry with ICMP type 0 is a normal echo reply, which is expected in response to echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for signs of volumetric attacks.  
- Investigate if the destination IP (140.191.4.57) is experiencing any service degradation or network issues that might warrant deeper inspection.
