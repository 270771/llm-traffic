Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an initiating ping flood.  
- No high volume or repetitive ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet to indicate flooding.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns but could be part of normal ICMP diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages correlate with routing or network issues.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
