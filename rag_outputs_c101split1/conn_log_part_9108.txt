Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no record of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest any other suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood or related anomaly is present.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- If ICMP traffic appears later, verify the ICMP type to detect potential ping floods.
