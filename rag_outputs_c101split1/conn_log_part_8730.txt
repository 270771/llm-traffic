Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without further data, no specific attack can be identified.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.222.202 and destination IP 185.138.73.88 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious traffic patterns. Collect more comprehensive logs to determine if other ICMP types or volumes indicate a different attack vector.
