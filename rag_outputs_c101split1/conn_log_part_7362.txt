Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet recorded (count=1) and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which are characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP echo request rate anomalies.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood attacks. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or ICMP traffic inspection on network devices to detect and mitigate future ICMP-based DoS attempts.
