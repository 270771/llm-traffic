Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags do not indicate suspicious behavior.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and the ICMP type mismatch.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to detect potential future ping floods. Also, review network baseline to identify unusual ICMP traffic volume patterns.
