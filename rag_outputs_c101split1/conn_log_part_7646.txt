Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood attack. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs to rule out a ping flood. Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving 151.105.96.5 and 133.105.230.133.
