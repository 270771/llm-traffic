Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets originating from a single source IP (18.72.141.69) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations.
- The high frequency of these ICMP type 8 packets sent to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical) matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with rapid ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic likely related to ICMP flood detection, taxonomy class: "Denial of Service - Network Flood").
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.72.141.69; Destination IPs include 203.78.139.253, 203.78.137.155, 203.78.137.100, 203.78.146.144, 203.78.137.98, 203.78.132.159, 203.78.146.250.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.72.141.69 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
