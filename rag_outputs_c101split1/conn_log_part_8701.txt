Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, no specific attack can be identified.

Next steps: Investigate additional ICMP traffic logs for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (203.78.143.78) or to the same destination (84.185.192.2) to confirm or rule out ping flood activity. Also, review network traffic volume and rate metrics for these IPs to detect potential flooding behavior.
