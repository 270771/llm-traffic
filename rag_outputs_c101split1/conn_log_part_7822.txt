Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- In the provided logs, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - 133.243.206.29 → 104.108.152.0 (type 8)  
  - 157.206.151.37 → 3.196.199.185 (type 8)  
- However, these entries show only a single packet each (last field = 1), not a high volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which are not relevant to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. If a ping flood were detected, heuristic #1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" would be appropriate.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity.  
- Confirm if any network performance degradation correlates with these ICMP packets.
