Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from `133.227.58.122` to `162.249.24.162` with a count of 2 packets, which is very low and does not indicate flooding.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not attacks.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP `133.227.58.122` if the number of ICMP Echo Requests rises significantly.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
