Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate traceroute or network diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (62.131.18.60 and 202.250.216.227) for unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 11 packets to rule out other reconnaissance or misconfiguration issues. Monitor for any shift to ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate potential ping flood attempts.
