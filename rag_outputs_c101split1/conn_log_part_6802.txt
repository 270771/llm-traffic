Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (35.83.191.13) sending numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) to multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.017 seconds per connection). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests to many targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.83.191.13; Destination IPs include 163.45.97.127, 163.45.108.104, 163.45.97.144, 163.45.97.14, 163.45.151.129, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (echo request), confirming ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.83.191.13 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or targeted by the attack.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle traffic if the attack volume escalates.
