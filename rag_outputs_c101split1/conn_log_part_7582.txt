Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), but no ICMP traffic is present. Therefore, no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic appears to be a series of TCP connection attempts, possibly scanning or failed connection attempts, but this does not match ping flood characteristics.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to determine if these connection attempts are malicious. Look for heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or port scanning in your anomaly taxonomy.
