Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 or 11, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries show type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages seen here, as they may indicate network issues or other types of scanning or misconfiguration. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect future ping flood attempts.
