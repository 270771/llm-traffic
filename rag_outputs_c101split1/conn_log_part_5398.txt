Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state flags, as these may indicate a port scan or other reconnaissance activity. Look for anomalies in connection rates or unusual source IPs. Collect ICMP logs separately to monitor for potential ping floods.
