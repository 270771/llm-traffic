Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network or host unreachable errors, which may be normal or symptomatic of other network issues but are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no underlying connectivity or routing problems exist. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns that could indicate a different attack vector.
