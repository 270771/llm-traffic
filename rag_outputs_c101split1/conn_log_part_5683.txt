Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the fourth column after the source IP. The entries show ICMP types 8, 11, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one record has type 8 (185.230.241.58 â†’ 202.101.170.253), but it is a single connection with 224 bytes and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no matching heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard knowledge, a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 185.230.241.58 for any unusual ICMP traffic patterns over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate ICMP attacks. Also, monitor for other ICMP types like 11 that may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but are not attacks.
