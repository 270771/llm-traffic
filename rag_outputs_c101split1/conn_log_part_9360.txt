Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (54.183.178.87) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the standard ping request. The traffic originates from numerous distinct source IPs (157.206.x.x range) sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession within the same second (timestamp 1641013232.98xxxx). This pattern of many hosts simultaneously sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.183.178.87 (ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are 0 or irrelevant)  
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.206.6.194 through 157.206.211.177 (at least a dozen distinct IPs)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 54.183.178.87.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other related DoS activities.  
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.  
6. Alert the affected system administrators to prepare for potential service degradation or outages.
