Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 172.23.68.231 to 203.78.167.63 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). The second entry shows ICMP type 3, which is a destination unreachable message, not a ping request. Since only ICMP type 8 traffic qualifies as ping flood candidates and there is only a single echo request logged, there is no evidence of a flood or high volume of echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more data over time to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP-based attacks.
