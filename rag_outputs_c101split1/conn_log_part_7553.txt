Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP and UDP connection attempts with no ICMP traffic entries.
- The only UDP entries have protocol number 17 (UDP) and no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets.
- Since ICMP type is not present and the rule states that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood, no ping flood is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The traffic pattern shows many failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the S0 state typically corresponds to SYN scan or connection attempts without completion.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts (S0) for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs involved in failed connections.
