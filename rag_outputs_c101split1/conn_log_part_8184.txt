Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which are not indicative of ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, these ICMP types often relate to network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
