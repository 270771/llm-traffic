Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.87.78.209) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This indicates a high volume of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming the target, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.227.x.x range (e.g., 133.227.244.255, 133.227.155.115, 133.227.176.6, etc.)
  - Destination: 35.87.78.209
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.87.78.209.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
