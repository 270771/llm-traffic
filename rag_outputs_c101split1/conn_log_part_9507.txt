Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, both of which do not match the known ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Collect more detailed logs or anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
