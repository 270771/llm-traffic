Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but the traffic volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a flood. The timestamps are not close enough to suggest rapid repeated pings from the same source to the same destination, and there is no evidence of excessive packet counts or sustained high-frequency ICMP traffic.

No anomaly records are found to support a ping flood or any other attack. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no specific heuristic or classification can be assigned. However, ICMP echo requests alone do not confirm an attack unless accompanied by volume or pattern anomalies.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if multiple such entries appear in rapid succession or if network performance degrades, which could indicate a developing ping flood.
