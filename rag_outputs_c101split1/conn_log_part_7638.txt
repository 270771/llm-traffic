Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 163.84.36.91 to destination 163.45.128.161, but it is a single packet with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 typically relates to network diagnostics or traceroute activity, not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate the source IP 163.84.36.91 if unusual ICMP echo request patterns emerge.
