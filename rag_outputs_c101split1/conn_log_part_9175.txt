Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic appears to be failed TCP and UDP connection attempts, possibly scanning or other reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP) from 45.121.95.154, which may indicate suspicious activity such as SIP scanning or reflection attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- If ICMP traffic appears, verify the ICMP type to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
