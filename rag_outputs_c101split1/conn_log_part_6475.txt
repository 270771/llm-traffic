Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request) or have missing type information. Specifically, the ICMP type field is represented by the Zeek "id.resp_p" column, which here shows values like 0 or 11, not 8. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded) or type 0 (Echo Reply) to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If suspicious traffic volume or patterns emerge, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for further analysis.
