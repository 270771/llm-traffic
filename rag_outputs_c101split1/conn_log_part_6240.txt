Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 11 and 3, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping floods.

The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood but may relate to network troubleshooting or other benign conditions.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP messages are unusually frequent or correlated with other suspicious activity, further investigation into network routing or misconfiguration issues could be warranted.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or other signs of volumetric ICMP attacks. If ICMP type 8 traffic increases significantly, re-evaluate for ping flood patterns.
