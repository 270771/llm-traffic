Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, both of which do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly records are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.  
- The absence of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based diagnostics or errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic patterns that could signal other attacks.
