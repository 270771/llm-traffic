Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with protocol number 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 messages typically indicate traceroute or network path issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP Time Exceeded messages are being generated from these source IPs (203.78.134.15 and 163.45.190.221) to the destination 13.252.225.107. This could indicate routing loops or misconfigurations rather than an attack. Monitoring for unusual ICMP error message volumes is recommended.
