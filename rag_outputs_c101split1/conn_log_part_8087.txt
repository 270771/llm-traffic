Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (value 0) but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Verify the ICMP type field explicitly in future logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
