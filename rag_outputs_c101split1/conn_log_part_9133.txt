Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages between the involved IPs (203.78.136.16 → 167.46.181.28 and 133.105.128.252 → 61.55.114.106) to rule out misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
