Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values observed are 0, 1, 3, and 13, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy, ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 13 (Timestamp Request), and 1 (Host Unreachable) indicate normal or diagnostic ICMP traffic rather than flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics and not part of reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would warrant re-evaluation for ping flood activity.
