Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (163.68.75.132) from different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds). All entries have ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping operations. The volume and concurrency of these ICMP Echo Requests strongly indicate a distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern, where many hosts send rapid pings to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 163.68.75.132 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0)  
- Source IPs: 133.243.240.189, 133.243.115.208, 133.243.88.134, 133.243.215.94, 133.227.235.147, 133.243.75.44, 133.243.87.6, 157.206.133.231, 133.243.9.112

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 163.68.75.132.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 163.68.75.132 and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as blackholing or traffic scrubbing.  
4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or abuse and consider blocking or throttling their traffic upstream.  
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged for future forensic analysis.
