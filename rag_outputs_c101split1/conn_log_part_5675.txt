Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field is "tcp"). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood and suggests no related ICMP-based DoS attack is visible here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (e.g., icmp.log) to check for ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP activity.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP connection attempts or SYN floods, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with flags like S0 (SYN sent, no reply), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- If TCP anomalies are suspected, apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning based on connection flags and volume.
