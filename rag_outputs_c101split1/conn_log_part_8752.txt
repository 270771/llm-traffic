Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.73.129.47) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is:  
  **Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood from a single source to multiple destinations.**  
- Taxonomy class:  
  **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flooding.**

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 18.73.129.47  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range (e.g., 163.45.165.7, 163.45.72.21, 163.45.94.25, etc.)  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 18.73.129.47 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or similar ICMP flooding behavior from this or other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. If possible, implement ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts or network segments to mitigate impact.  
5. Review and update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
