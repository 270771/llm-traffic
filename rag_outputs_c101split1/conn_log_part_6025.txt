Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request), except one entry with type 0 and one with type 1, but none with type 8. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without explicit heuristics, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic strongly indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP types present (3, 11, 1, 0) for other possible ICMP-based issues such as destination unreachable (type 3) or time exceeded (type 11), which may indicate network misconfigurations or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
