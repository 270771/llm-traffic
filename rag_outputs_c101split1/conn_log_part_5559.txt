Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and the presence of many TCP SYN attempts with flags indicating connection attempts (S0 state) suggest possible scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (SYN sent, no response) for potential port scanning or SYN flood attacks. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood is occurring. Implement network monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping floods.
