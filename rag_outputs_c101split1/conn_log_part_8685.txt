Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures specifically for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm if any ping flood attempts exist. Also, monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity indicated by the many TCP SYN (S0) connection attempts seen here, which may suggest reconnaissance or SYN flood attempts.
