Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (field 11), which is "-", meaning no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the OTH (Other) connection state and verify if this ICMP traffic corresponds to legitimate control messages or other benign ICMP types. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP would be prudent to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
