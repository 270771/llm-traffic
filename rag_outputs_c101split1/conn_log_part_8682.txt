Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple connection attempts primarily over TCP and UDP protocols, but none explicitly indicate ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The only UDP entries present do not specify ICMP type, and no ICMP traffic is logged here. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, S0 connection states correspond to failed connection attempts, often linked to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.146, 89.247.66.138) for potential scanning activity. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm or rule out ping floods. Enable detailed ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
