Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 corresponds to ICMP type 11 = Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP type 11, it may indicate traceroute or network diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume or frequency of ICMP type 11 packets is unusually high, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency to detect potential ping floods in the future.
