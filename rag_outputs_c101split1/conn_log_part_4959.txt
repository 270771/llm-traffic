Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.
- The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP traffic, no relevant heuristic or taxonomy for ping flood can be applied.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN failures (S0) for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to better classify suspicious TCP behaviors.
