Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged here, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies. Without ICMP data, ping flood detection is not possible here.
