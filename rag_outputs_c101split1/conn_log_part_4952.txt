Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity. The single entry with port 4 is still TCP, not ICMP, and thus irrelevant for ping flood detection.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present. Also, monitor for other TCP-based anomalies since many TCP connection attempts here show S0 (SYN sent, no response), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity worth further review.
