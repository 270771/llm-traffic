Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IP 218.34.49.203 to 203.78.241.235 and from 24.26.170.70 to 203.78.195.15. However, these are isolated entries with very low counts (1 packet each) and no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and flags indicate no retransmissions or floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IPs 218.34.49.203 and 24.26.170.70 if they repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Without provided context, assign heuristic number 1 (basic ICMP anomaly detection) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance" for isolated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- No evidence of DoS or flooding at this time.
