Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate other logs or packet captures for ICMP traffic to confirm if any ping flood attempts exist. Also, review firewall or IDS alerts for ICMP anomalies. The current data only shows multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.
