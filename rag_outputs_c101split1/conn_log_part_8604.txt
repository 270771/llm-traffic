Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 0. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," neither of which constitute a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error and reply messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
