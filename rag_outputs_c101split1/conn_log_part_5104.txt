Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic #1 often relates to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" would apply to ping floods, but these do not apply here due to lack of ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing or analyzing ICMP traffic logs specifically. Enable or review ICMP-specific Zeek logs (icmp.log) to detect any potential ping flood activity. Also, monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that might indicate a SYN flood or scanning attack.
