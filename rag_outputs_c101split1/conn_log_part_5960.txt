Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 103.185.80.250, with a single packet and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets excludes a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Echo Reply) for potential other network issues or reconnaissance activity, but no immediate flooding attack is evident. Monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets is recommended.
