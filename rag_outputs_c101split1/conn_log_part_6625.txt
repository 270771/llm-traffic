Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = "tcp") with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP traffic is present here, this cannot be a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures specifically for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect ping floods. Also, review other logs or anomaly data for signs of scanning or other TCP-based attacks.
