Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no identified suspicious ICMP activity.
- The TCP connections show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these TCP SYN attempts would be reconnaissance or scanning, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets for potential TCP SYN scan or DoS attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- No heuristics or taxonomy related to ping flood apply here due to lack of ICMP type 8 traffic.
- The TCP SYN attempts could fall under heuristic for reconnaissance (commonly heuristic #1) and taxonomy class "Network Scanning," but this requires further data.
