Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present only in two entries, but the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood. The counts of packets (`id.orig_p` and `id.resp_p` fields) and connection states (`state` = OTH) show isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a high-rate flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are also present, which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 8 alone is insufficient to confirm a ping flood without volume or rate indicators.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sudden increase in ICMP echo requests from any single source IP to a target IP.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts for potential ICMP flood patterns.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (e.g., 58.142.235.229, 151.105.96.5) show repeated or sustained ICMP echo requests over time.
