Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of the ICMP Timestamp Requests between 202.244.69.57 and 193.96.13.99 to rule out reconnaissance or timing-based probing, but no immediate threat is indicated by this log entry.
