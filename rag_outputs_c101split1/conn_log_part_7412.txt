Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a destination port of 0 and no ICMP type explicitly listed as 8 (Echo Request). Since the Zeek conn.log snippet does not specify ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but is not sufficient evidence of an attack here.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type field in more detail if available, and monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 133.227.58.122 to 98.198.253.97. Also, review additional logs for volume and frequency patterns consistent with flooding.
