Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity related to ICMP or ping floods.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data.
