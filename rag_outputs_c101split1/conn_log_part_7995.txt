Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 13 and 0, respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request" and type 0 corresponds to "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP traffic from these IPs to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or scanning activities. Monitoring for repeated or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
