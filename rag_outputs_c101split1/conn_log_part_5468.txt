Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, as these could represent other types of DoS or reconnaissance attacks. Collect ICMP logs or packet captures to verify if any ICMP-based attacks are occurring.
