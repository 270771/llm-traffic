Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 133.251.73.56, with a single packet and zero bytes transferred, which does not indicate flooding.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 1 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods.  
- No repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests are present in the snippet.  

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) packets for possible network issues or other attack types such as traceroute or scanning activity.
