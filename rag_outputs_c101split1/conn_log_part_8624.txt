Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent to a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (~milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for volumetric ICMP flood attacks and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 157.206.123.30, 157.206.108.233, 157.206.127.228, 133.243.25.61, 157.206.157.6, 133.243.112.224, and others, all targeting 163.84.73.84 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (163.84.73.84) for performance degradation or service impact.
  4. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or filtering attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume severely impacts network availability.
