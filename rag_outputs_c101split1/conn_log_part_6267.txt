Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 0 and 8. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood traffic. Here, one entry has ICMP type 8 (from 172.23.68.231 to 163.45.26.94), but the other entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 133.243.206.29 to 104.115.170.252. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request does not constitute a flood. Also, the logs show only one connection each, with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found to support suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at a high rate. If a surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, investigate for possible ping flood. Also, verify if any other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other attack types.
