Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports that no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.
- The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these TCP SYN attempts would be reconnaissance or scanning activity, not a denial-of-service via ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or SYN flood attacks.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these TCP attempts are malicious.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- No heuristics or taxonomy related to ICMP ping flood are applicable here due to lack of ICMP traffic.
- The TCP SYN attempts could fall under heuristic categories for scanning or reconnaissance if such context were available.
