Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (4th column) in the majority of entries is not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two entries show ICMP type 8 (lines with source IP 151.105.96.5), but these are isolated single packets, not a flood pattern.  
- The other ICMP traffic types (3, 11) correspond to different ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, time exceeded), not ping requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no known ping flood heuristic applies here.  
- The traffic does not match the ping flood taxonomy class (ICMP Echo Request flood).

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.139.211 for unusual ICMP activity since it sends multiple ICMP packets of various types, though not type 8.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP traffic that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks such as ICMP scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
