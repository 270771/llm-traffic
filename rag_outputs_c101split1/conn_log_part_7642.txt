Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Both ICMP entries have types 8 and 11. The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but there is only a single such record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods. Since a ping flood requires a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in rapid succession, this sparse data does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate.  
- Investigate if any other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other attack types such as ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial of service.
