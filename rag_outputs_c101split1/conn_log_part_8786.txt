Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.29.24.223, within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641013228.83). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches common heuristic patterns for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.206.x.x range and 54.249.65.236 are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 3.29.24.223. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.29.24.223.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to apply ingress filtering or blackhole routing for the attacking source IPs.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential mitigation escalation if attack volume increases.
