Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are `0` and `-` (missing or unspecified), not `8`. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.  
- The first record shows ICMP type `-` (unknown or not set), and the second record shows ICMP type `0` (Echo Reply), which is a response, not a request.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are absent despite ICMP traffic presence.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal ICMP traffic volume.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network issues, such as ICMP unreachable or redirect messages, if relevant.
