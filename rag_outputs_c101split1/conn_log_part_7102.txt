Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic shown in the Zeek conn.log snippet does not indicate an ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. The first entry shows ICMP traffic with no type specified, and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not a request. Ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm a target.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP Echo Requests and no other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match a ping flood or any other clear attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm if any ping flood attempts exist.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- If ICMP Echo Requests appear later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify accordingly.
