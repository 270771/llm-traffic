Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.132.112 to destination 139.93.218.236, but it appears as a single event with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11, 13) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests for volume spikes from 203.78.132.112 could be a prudent next step to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
