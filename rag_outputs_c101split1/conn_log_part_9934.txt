Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 133.227.58.120 to 222.141.65.152 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second record shows ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request), also not type 8.  
Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 11 and 13 are typically related to network diagnostics or traceroute-like activity, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 11 and 13 packets is unusually high, which could indicate reconnaissance or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
