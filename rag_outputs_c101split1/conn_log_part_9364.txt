Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the type used for ping.
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.206.x.x subnet are sending ICMP Echo Requests to two distinct destination IPs: 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26.
- The volume and concurrency of these ICMP Echo Requests within the same timestamp strongly indicate a coordinated flood rather than normal ping activity.
- The ICMP type being 8 confirms these are ping requests, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack where many echo requests overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with a classic ICMP flood heuristic, typically labeled as:
  - Heuristic: ICMP Flood Detection (commonly heuristic #3 in many taxonomies)
  - Taxonomy Class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple hosts in 157.206.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.206.211.89, 157.206.0.155, 157.206.206.166, etc.)
- Destination IPs: 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.206.0.0/16).
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns targeting the destination IPs.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs to identify potential compromised hosts within the source subnet.
4. Notify affected parties (owners of 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) to prepare for mitigation and possible upstream filtering.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent attacking IPs if mitigation at the perimeter is insufficient.
6. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are part of a botnet or compromised network segment.

This targeted and immediate response will help mitigate the ongoing ping flood attack and reduce impact on the targeted hosts.
