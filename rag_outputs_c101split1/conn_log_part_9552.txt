Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Request (ICMP type 8) entries with high frequency from the same source IP to confirm any ping flood attempts. Monitor for patterns of repeated ICMP Echo Requests to the destination IP 163.45.225.83 from 172.23.68.231.
