Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.74.222) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H-001** for "ICMP Echo Request Flood" based on common heuristic naming conventions.  
- Taxonomy class: **Network Denial of Service (DoS)** attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 44.202.74.222 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.247.109, 133.243.113.37, 133.243.68.95, 133.243.210.248, 133.243.210.202, 133.243.111.77, 133.243.68.71, 133.243.192.123, 133.243.255.164, 133.243.87.8, 133.243.255.177, 133.243.247.118, 133.243.200.221, 133.243.240.14, 133.243.67.1  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 44.202.74.222.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.
