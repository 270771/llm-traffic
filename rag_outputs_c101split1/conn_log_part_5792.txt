Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" (the 7th field after source IP and port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between these IPs to ensure it is legitimate response traffic and not part of a different anomaly pattern. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
