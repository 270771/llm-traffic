Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types: 11, 10, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only one record with type 8 (echo request), and it does not show a high volume or rapid repetition indicative of a flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 10 = Router Advertisement) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from any IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.132.112 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 83.252.112.215 for any unusual behavior.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
