Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 182.42.30.254, with a single packet and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests. Other ICMP types present (1, 3, 10, 11) are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods. There is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Request traffic typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. The presence of other ICMP types may indicate normal network diagnostics or error messages, not an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP. If volume spikes or multiple Echo Requests are observed in a short time frame, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for comprehensive analysis.
