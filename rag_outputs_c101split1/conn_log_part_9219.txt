Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. However, ICMP type 13 traffic could warrant further investigation to ensure it is legitimate, as timestamp requests are less common and can be used in reconnaissance.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 13 packets from 202.244.71.65 to 198.56.151.101. If volume spikes or correlates with other suspicious activity, consider deeper packet inspection and network behavior analysis.
