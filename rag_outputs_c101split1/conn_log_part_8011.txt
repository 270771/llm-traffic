Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic (type 11) could be related to network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 115.234.225.159 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based issues, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is evident.
