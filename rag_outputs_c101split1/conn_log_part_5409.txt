Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged, no ping flood is detected. The single UDP entry is a DNS query (port 53), unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type matching ping flood characteristics is evident.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs specifically (icmp.log or equivalent) to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns to detect potential ping floods.
