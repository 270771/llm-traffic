Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type is not explicitly listed as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The first entry shows ICMP with no type specified, and the second entry has a last field value of 1, which corresponds to ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard taxonomy, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or similar ICMP-based DoS attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity, especially the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages, which could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in logs for precise attack detection.
