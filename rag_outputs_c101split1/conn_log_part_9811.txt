Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would be identifiable by protocol number 1 (ICMP), but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only UDP (protocol 17) and TCP (protocol 6) traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to confirm a ping flood.
- The traffic mostly involves UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP ports, none indicating ICMP or ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class applies here.
- Typical ping flood heuristics would involve high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP, which is absent.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses on port 5060, as this may indicate SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP traffic spikes.
