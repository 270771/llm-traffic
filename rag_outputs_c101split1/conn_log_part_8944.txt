Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 3 messages are being generated between 203.78.140.213 and 209.148.204.66, as frequent destination unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
