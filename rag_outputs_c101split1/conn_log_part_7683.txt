Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - 128.149.158.11 → 163.45.135.124 (type 8)  
  - 151.105.96.5 → 133.105.230.186 (type 8)  
- However, these entries show single or very low counts (last field is 1), indicating isolated pings rather than a flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No attack is present. The traffic does not match ping flood patterns (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations). The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated OTH (other) connection states that may indicate scanning or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
