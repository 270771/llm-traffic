Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, no ping flood is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans would fall under reconnaissance heuristics and taxonomy classes related to scanning or probing.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures for potential scanning activity. Collect ICMP logs or packet captures to verify if any ICMP traffic is present that might indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks.
