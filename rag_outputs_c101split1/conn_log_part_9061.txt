Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries show mostly connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources to identify ping floods.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
