Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields, where the destination port is 0. For ICMP traffic, the "port" fields often represent the ICMP type and code. Here, the destination port is 0, which corresponds to ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), which indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not specifically indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Echo Replies are being logged without corresponding Echo Requests, as this could indicate misconfiguration or other network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
