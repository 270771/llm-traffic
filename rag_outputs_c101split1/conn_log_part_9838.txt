Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping.
- The source IP 13.24.252.2 is sending multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession to multiple destination IPs (202.250.250.127, 202.250.204.127, 202.250.250.123, 202.250.204.119, 202.250.204.126).
- The timestamps are nearly identical (within milliseconds), indicating a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The log shows no replies or other traffic, suggesting a one-way flood rather than normal ping activity.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 13.24.252.2
- Targets/destination IPs: 202.250.250.127, 202.250.204.127, 202.250.250.123, 202.250.204.119, 202.250.204.126
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.24.252.2 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other DoS patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate-based anomaly detection or blackhole routing for affected targets.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
