Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 35.52.110.20 to destination 163.45.42.105, with a single packet (count=1) and no indication of rapid or repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The lack of repeated ICMP type 8 packets excludes ping flood; the other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are normal control messages.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP or multiple sources targeting a single destination.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.52.110.20 if it starts sending multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Continue logging and correlate with other network data to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
