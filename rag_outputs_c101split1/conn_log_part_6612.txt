Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs containing ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that could suggest other ICMP-based attacks such as ICMP unreachable floods or smurf attacks.
