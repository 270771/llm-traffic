Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not a ping flood indicator. The second entry has ICMP type 8, but it is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require repeated ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood attacks.
