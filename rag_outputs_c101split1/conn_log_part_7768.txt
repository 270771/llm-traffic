Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type field missing or marked as "-", and none explicitly show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks. The presence of ICMP traffic alone, especially with type not equal to 8, does not indicate a ping flood. The entries show OTH (other) connection states and no signs of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to detect other potential network anomalies.
