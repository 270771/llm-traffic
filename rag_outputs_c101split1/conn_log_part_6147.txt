Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP Echo Requests) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before logging.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as the logs show many TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance.  
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.
