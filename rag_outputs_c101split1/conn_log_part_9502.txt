Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All the conn.log entries show UDP or TCP traffic; none indicate ICMP protocol usage.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, and no such ICMP entries are visible.
- The traffic mostly involves UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP ports, none matching ICMP or ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses on port 5060, as this could indicate SIP scanning or a UDP flood attempt.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Review firewall and IDS rules for UDP port 5060 to ensure no SIP abuse or amplification attacks are occurring.
