Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without further data, no definitive attack classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between IPs 133.227.159.48 and 107.132.243.216 to determine if it is part of a different ICMP-based anomaly or misconfiguration. Collect additional logs or enable detailed ICMP type logging to clarify the traffic purpose.
