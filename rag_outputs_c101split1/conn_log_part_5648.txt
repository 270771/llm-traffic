Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (commonly related to ICMP Echo Request floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek’s conn.log may not log ICMP by default or may require separate ICMP logging enabled.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 flags (connection attempts without completion) are visible, which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.  
- Enable or review Zeek’s icmp.log or equivalent to detect ICMP-based anomalies.
