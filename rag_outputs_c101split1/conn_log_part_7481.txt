Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries with various ICMP types. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the relevant type for ping floods:

- From 35.52.110.20 to 163.45.139.2  
- From 35.52.110.20 to 163.45.101.34

However, these are isolated ICMP Echo Requests with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3, 10, 11) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.52.110.20 for unusual ICMP activity patterns.  
- Enable rate-limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests if abnormal traffic is detected.
