Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with various types. The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only sporadically and not in a high-frequency burst pattern typical of a ping flood. For example, entries with ICMP type 8 are from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.43 and 133.105.230.44, and from 27.54.196.222 to 133.105.156.135, but these are isolated and not repeated rapidly or in large volume. Other ICMP types (0, 3, 128, 129) are present, indicating normal ICMP traffic such as Echo Reply (0) and Destination Unreachable (3), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or rate from single or multiple sources. Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, which could indicate early stages of a ping flood or reconnaissance activity.
