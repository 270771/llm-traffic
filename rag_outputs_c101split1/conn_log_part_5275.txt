Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.146 on port 8080) for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.
