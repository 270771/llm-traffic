Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connection records; there are no ICMP entries.
- Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious ICMP or other attack types.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP echo requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies or rate-based alerts.
