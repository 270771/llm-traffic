Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would require ICMP type 8) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before logging.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.
