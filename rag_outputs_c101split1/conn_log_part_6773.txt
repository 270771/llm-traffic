Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from source IP 133.243.206.29 to two different destinations (149.71.175.240 and 173.50.189.4), but the packet counts and byte counts are zero or very low, indicating no flood-level volume. The other ICMP entry with type 11 (Time Exceeded) does not qualify as a ping flood since the ICMP type is not 8.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Given the low volume and lack of repeated echo requests, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which typically involve a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor the source IP 133.243.206.29 for any increase in ICMP echo request volume.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 traffic from 133.227.58.122 is related to network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP flood detection based on volume thresholds and repeated echo requests to improve future detection.
