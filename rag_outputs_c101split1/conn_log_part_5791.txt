Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; none indicate ICMP traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP entries means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without heuristic context, the default taxonomy for ping flood would require ICMP type 8 traffic, which is missing.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or alerts.
- Monitor for other DoS or scanning activity indicated by the many TCP SYN (S0) entries with no established connections, which may suggest SYN scan or SYN flood attempts. These would fall under heuristic class for TCP SYN flood or scanning, typically heuristic #6 in many taxonomies.
