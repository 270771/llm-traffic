Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but the first entry shows type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.5, and the second entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping floods. However, the first entry alone does not indicate a flood because there is only a single connection record with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests. Also, no anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy: Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP Echo Request rate anomalies.

Next steps: Investigate traffic volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.5 over a longer time window to confirm if a flood pattern emerges. Monitor for repeated or sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.
