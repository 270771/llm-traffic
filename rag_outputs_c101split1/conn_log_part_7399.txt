Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or Destination Unreachable, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets with high frequency from the same source IP (210.162.65.254) to the destination (103.97.146.20) in other logs to rule out ping flood attempts. Also, monitor for other ICMP types that may indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service activities.
