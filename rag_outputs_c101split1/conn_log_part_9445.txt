Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the destination port field (which is 0 here), but more importantly, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood. The log shows ICMP traffic but does not specify type 8, and the connection state is OTH (other), which typically indicates incomplete or unusual connection states, not a flood of echo requests. There is only a single ICMP packet recorded (count=1), which is insufficient to indicate flooding.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate a different attack type.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.243.19.169) to the destination (167.46.181.104). If a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests is observed, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, verify if other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
