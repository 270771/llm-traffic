Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such connection recorded, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination or a high packet rate, this does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The heuristic for ping flood detection typically involves detecting a high rate of ICMP echo requests (type 8) from one source to a target, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 messages for potential network issues or misconfigurations.
