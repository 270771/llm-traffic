Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.192.28.218) from numerous distinct source IPs (all in the 133.243.x.x range) within the same second (timestamp 1641013211.7xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.192.28.218 (destination)  
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources including 133.243.180.246, 133.243.116.148, 133.243.92.201, 133.243.88.30, 133.243.10.188, and others.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.192.28.218.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified attacker IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and prepare to apply blackhole routing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.  
5. Notify the affected system owners to ensure host-level protections and logging are enabled.
