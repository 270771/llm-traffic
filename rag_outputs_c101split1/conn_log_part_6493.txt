Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 3 (as indicated by the 4th and 6th fields representing ICMP type and code, respectively). None have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) indicates normal or error-related ICMP traffic, not a flood of echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, if this were an attack, heuristic #1 would typically correspond to ICMP echo request flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "DoS:PingFlood."

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages if unusual volumes are observed, as these can indicate network scanning or misconfigurations. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping floods.
