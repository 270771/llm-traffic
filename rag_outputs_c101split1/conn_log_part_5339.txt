Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP entries are present, there is no evidence of a ping flood. Additionally, the absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents linking this traffic to known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy.

No other attack type is clearly indicated here; the logs mostly show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using tools or logs that record ICMP types and counts. Monitoring for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources would be the next step to detect ping floods. Also, enable anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to correlate with heuristics once available.
