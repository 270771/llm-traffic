Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3, 11, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates a ping request relevant to ping flood attacks. Here, there is only one record with ICMP type 8 (from 128.149.158.11 to 163.45.159.135), but it is a single event, not a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded, 3 again) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. However, since no flood pattern (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets) is observed, no attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 event for legitimacy, but it does not indicate an attack.  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review other ICMP types (3, 11) for possible network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies.
