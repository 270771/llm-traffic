Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) entries in the logs or other signs of volumetric ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
