Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 5, 10, and 13, none of which are ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 5 (Redirect), 10 (Router Advertisement), and 13 (Timestamp) may indicate other network activities or misconfigurations but are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source and purpose of these ICMP messages to rule out misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance or network issues. Monitoring for unusual volumes or patterns of these ICMP types could be warranted if network performance issues arise.
