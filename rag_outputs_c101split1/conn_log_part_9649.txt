Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.76.68.232) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are within milliseconds). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 18.76.68.232  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 18.76.68.232 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for additional signs of volumetric ICMP attacks or other protocol abuses from this source.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., rate limiting, anomaly-based IDS signatures).  
5. Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks from other sources.
