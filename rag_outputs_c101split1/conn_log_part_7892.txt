Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields (source port 11, destination port 0), but these do not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other types of attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type other than 8 to determine if it relates to other ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messages. Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information from logs or packet captures for further analysis.
