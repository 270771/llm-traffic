Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 1 and 13, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute a ping flood, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

- ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages.  
- ICMP type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request" messages.  

No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest these are part of another attack. However, the presence of ICMP type 1 messages could indicate network issues or misconfigurations worth investigating.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.139.211 sending ICMP type 1 messages to 162.113.225.123 for potential network errors or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high volumes of ICMP type 8 traffic for future detection.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
