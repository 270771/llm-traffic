Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting two distinct destination IPs: 3.39.157.141 and 69.232.167.15. Multiple source IPs from different subnets are sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously within the same timestamp, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target hosts with excessive ping traffic.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is:

- Heuristic: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single destination within a short time frame.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Targets: 3.39.157.141 and 69.232.167.15 (destination IPs)
- Sources: Multiple IPs including 157.206.126.235, 133.243.102.179, 133.243.103.240, 157.206.141.95, 157.206.89.177, 133.243.150.173, and others.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to block or filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
5. Alert affected system owners to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary disabling of ICMP responses if appropriate.
