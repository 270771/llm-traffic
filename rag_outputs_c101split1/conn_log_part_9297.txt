Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP-related entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 17 (UDP) or TCP/UDP protocols; there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present.
- The traffic consists mainly of UDP packets on port 5060 and various TCP connections with SYN flags, none matching the ICMP Echo Request pattern required for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood attack.

Other observations:
- The traffic shows multiple UDP packets to port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), which could indicate scanning or enumeration attempts but not a ping flood.
- The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no direct mapping is possible; however, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets to port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or DoS attempts.
- Monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request spikes to detect possible ping floods.
- Enable heuristic context and anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to improve detection accuracy.
