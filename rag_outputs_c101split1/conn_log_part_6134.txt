Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the frequency and volume of ICMP type 13 packets from 133.243.204.129 to 2.77.121.24 to rule out potential reconnaissance or timing-based attacks. Monitoring for repeated or high-rate ICMP traffic of any type is recommended.
