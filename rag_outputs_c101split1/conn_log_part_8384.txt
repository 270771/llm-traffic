Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 133 and 128, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed, this traffic may represent other ICMP message types (such as Router Advertisement or Timestamp Reply), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 128 and 133 in your network environment to understand their purpose.  
- Monitor for any unusual volume or patterns of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods in the future.
