Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is related to diagnostic or error messages rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP type 11, it may be related to network troubleshooting or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.120 and destination IP 221.201.156.242 for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
