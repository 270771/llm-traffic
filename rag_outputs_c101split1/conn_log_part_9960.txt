Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections from different source IPs (133.243.147.126, 133.243.158.52, 133.243.115.213, 133.243.136.12, 133.243.254.217, 133.243.175.253, 133.243.16.54, 133.243.101.239, 133.243.213.130) all targeting the same destination IP (3.17.177.6) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The rapid succession and volume of these echo requests from multiple sources to a single target strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**.  
- Taxonomy class: **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Source IPs: 133.243.147.126, 133.243.158.52, 133.243.115.213, 133.243.136.12, 133.243.254.217, 133.243.175.253, 133.243.16.54, 133.243.101.239, 133.243.213.130  
- Destination IP: 3.17.177.6  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor the target host (3.17.177.6) for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential denial of service impact.  
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and take appropriate remediation steps.
