Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The logs show multiple TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts, but not ICMP flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically heuristic #1 (SYN scan) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance" if such context were available.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts from IP 89.247.69.180 and others, as this may indicate scanning or a SYN flood attempt.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for potential ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these TCP attempts are part of a larger attack pattern.
