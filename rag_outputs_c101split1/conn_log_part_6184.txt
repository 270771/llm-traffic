Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages or could indicate other network issues but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to assign specific heuristic numbers or taxonomy classes. However, these ICMP types typically fall under network error or diagnostic messages rather than attack categories.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to determine if there are routing issues or misconfigurations causing these errors. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
