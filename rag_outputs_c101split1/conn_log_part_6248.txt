Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet recorded (count=1) from source IP 60.64.233.10 to destination 202.250.236.142, which is insufficient to indicate a flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP echo requests or a high packet rate, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, verify if the ICMP type 11 messages indicate network issues or traceroute activity.
