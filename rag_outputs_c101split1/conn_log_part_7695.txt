Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are isolated connection records without evidence of high-frequency or volumetric traffic typical of a ping flood. The timestamps and counts do not indicate rapid repeated requests from a single source to a single destination. Additionally, one entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs showing high ICMP Echo Request rates or volume spikes.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from single IPs over short intervals.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial attempts, given the presence of ICMP type 3 messages.
