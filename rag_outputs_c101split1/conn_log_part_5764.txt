Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 1.196.1.189 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP Time Exceeded messages, but no immediate attack response is warranted.
