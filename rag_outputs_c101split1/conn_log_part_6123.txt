Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 0, 1, 3, or 8, but only one record shows ICMP type 8 (echo request) and it is a single event, not a flood. The other ICMP types (3, 1) correspond to destination unreachable and echo reply or other control messages, which are normal or unrelated to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination in rapid succession, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack heuristic focused on ICMP echo request floods.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency.  
- Investigate the source IP 148.25.147.183 sending the single ICMP type 8 packet to 163.45.87.53 for any unusual behavior.  
- Collect more data over time to detect potential emerging patterns of ICMP abuse.
