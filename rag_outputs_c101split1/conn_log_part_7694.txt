Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0 and 8. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood activity. Here, only two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (which is unusual but may represent the ICMP type field), and one entry has ICMP type 0. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a floodâ€”there are only three discrete connections logged, not a high-rate or sustained burst typical of ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs 151.105.96.5 and 114.18.199.193 for legitimate ICMP Echo Requests to 133.105.230.178 and 202.250.215.109 respectively, to rule out scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from these IPs to detect any emerging flood patterns.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential related activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data.
