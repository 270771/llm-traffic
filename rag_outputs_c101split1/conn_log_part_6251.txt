Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 1, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

- ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable  
- ICMP type 0 = Echo Reply  
- ICMP type 13 = Timestamp Request  

These types indicate other ICMP activity but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. Generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP Echo Request floods, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ICMP Flood," which does not fit this data.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations, especially since type 13 (Timestamp Request) can be used for network mapping. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect emerging ping floods.
