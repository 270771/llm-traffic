Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple entries show ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping.
- The destination IP 18.55.153.245 is repeatedly targeted by numerous source IPs (130.187.228.61, 130.187.26.248, 130.187.200.251, 130.187.201.84, 130.187.37.32) sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession.
- The high frequency and volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination strongly match the known pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical heuristic for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host."
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 18.55.153.245 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: 130.187.228.61, 130.187.26.248, 130.187.200.251, 130.187.201.84, 130.187.37.32
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.55.153.245.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalies and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges.
- Ensure the victim host has appropriate firewall rules to limit ICMP traffic and prevent resource exhaustion.
