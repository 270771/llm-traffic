Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from two source IPs (3.241.1.60 and 35.211.173.188) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps clustered around 1641013236). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm targets with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most relevant heuristic is typically labeled as "ICMP Flood Detection" (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks).  
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP-based DoS.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attackers: 3.241.1.60 and 35.211.173.188 (source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets)  
- Targets: Multiple IPs in the 163.45.x.x range (destination IPs)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (3.241.1.60 and 35.211.173.188).  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic sources for possible upstream filtering or blackholing.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for any escalation or spread of the attack.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP traffic anomaly detection tools to alert on similar future events.
