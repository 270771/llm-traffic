Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values other than 8 (echo request). Only two entries have ICMP type 8, but they are isolated and directed to different destination IPs (133.105.230.14 and 133.105.230.12) with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from one source to one or multiple destinations that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic #1 would correspond to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ICMP Flood," but these do not apply here due to lack of evidence.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from single sources to single or multiple destinations. If volume spikes or patterns of repeated echo requests emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review other logs or network metrics for signs of denial-of-service activity.
