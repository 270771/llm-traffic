Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches the classic ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests to saturate network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.236.220.60; Destination IPs include 163.45.14.138, 163.45.112.254, 163.45.238.249, 163.45.17.117, 163.45.74.149, and many others in the 163.45.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (echo request), confirming ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.236.220.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify affected network segments and prepare to implement traffic shaping or blackholing if the attack escalates.
4. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
5. Update intrusion detection signatures to alert on similar high-rate ICMP echo request patterns.
