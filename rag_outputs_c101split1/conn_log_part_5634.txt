Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is required for ping flood detection. However, these two echo requests are isolated single packets with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests to the same target IP (47.201.192.242). The first entry is ICMP type 13 (timestamp request), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a large number of ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly from one or more sources to a target, which is not observed here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs. If a surge in ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single IP is detected, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if the ICMP traffic correlates with other suspicious activity or network degradation.
