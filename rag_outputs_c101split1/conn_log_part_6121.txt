Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet is logged with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source targeting the same destination, this traffic does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same IP to the same target.  
- Investigate the source IP 201.92.52.5 for unusual ICMP activity if volume increases.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests if suspicious patterns emerge.
