Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 13, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages and type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request," which may indicate other network diagnostic or error conditions rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and frequency of these ICMP messages to rule out misconfigurations or other network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
