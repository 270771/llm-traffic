Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3` respectively, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm a target, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed:  
- Type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues.  
- Type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network or host unreachable conditions.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.120 and 163.45.185.71) for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing these ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
