Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is present.
- The only ICMP-related entry (timestamp 1641013260.785965) shows ICMP type 8 with 1.618065 seconds duration and 8 packets, but this is a single record and does not indicate a flood pattern (high volume or rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic pattern is consistent with scanning or failed TCP connection attempts, not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, the default assumption is no ICMP flood heuristic triggered.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could be related to reconnaissance or scanning, which typically falls under heuristic class for scanning or connection attempts, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.153, 89.247.69.149) for potential scanning activity.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) volume to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume thresholds to catch ping floods early.
