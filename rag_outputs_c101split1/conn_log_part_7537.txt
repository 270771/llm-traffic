Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The TCP entries show many SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- The UDP entries are mostly DNS queries (port 53), with no indication of ICMP or flooding behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed TCP SYN failures could align with a heuristic for port scanning or connection flooding (commonly heuristic #1: "Port Scan" or heuristic #2: "Connection Flood"), and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance" or "DoS" respectively.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures (S0) for potential scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs such as 89.247.69.180 and 185.167.249.147, which appear frequently in failed connection attempts.
