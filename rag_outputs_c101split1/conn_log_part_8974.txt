Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages but does not constitute an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages between 157.206.171.224 and 3.197.247.113 to ensure no underlying connectivity or routing problems exist. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
