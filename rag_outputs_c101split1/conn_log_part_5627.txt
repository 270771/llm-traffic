Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 corresponds to "Echo Reply," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no network misconfigurations or routing issues are causing excessive unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
