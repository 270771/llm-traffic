Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are isolated single entries, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11, 13) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), with no repeated or sustained ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and frequency for these IPs could be a prudent next step to detect any emerging patterns.
