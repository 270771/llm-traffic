Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (174.95.41.114) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013221.4xxxxxx).
- ICMP type 8 is the standard ping request, and the volume and distribution of these requests from numerous sources to one target strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attack pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context requires assigning a default heuristic and taxonomy:
  - Heuristic: 1 (High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources)
  - Taxonomy: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood

Involved IPs and ports:
- Victim IP: 174.95.41.114 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources including 133.243.112.194, 133.243.69.121, 133.243.116.74, 133.243.26.31, 133.243.123.241, 133.243.15.99, 133.243.67.80, 133.243.100.239, 133.243.175.253, 133.243.116.76, 133.243.127.67, 133.243.69.103, 133.243.81.255, 133.243.78.3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 174.95.41.114.
- Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts among the attacker IPs and remediate accordingly.
