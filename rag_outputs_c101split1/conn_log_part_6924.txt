Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The traffic shows a single ICMP packet with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple similar ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) over time from the same source IP (62.131.95.37) to the destination (203.78.143.78) to rule out low-rate or stealthy ICMP attacks. Monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests.
