Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have ICMP type field as 0 (indicated by the "0" in the 7th column after source IP and port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP traffic here appears to be either Echo Replies (type 0) or other ICMP types, but not Echo Requests.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Also, monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs, which would be indicative of a ping flood.
