Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 131.140.198.78 to 174.156.53.117 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second record shows ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request), also not type 8.  
- Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types (11 and 13) suggest other network diagnostic or control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 11 or 13 messages that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
