Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 3, which is a Destination Unreachable message, not related to ping floods. There is only a single ICMP Echo Request record with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other indicators, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate.  
- Investigate the source IP 54.254.197.94 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests in large volumes.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network scanning activities, especially involving ICMP type 3 messages.
