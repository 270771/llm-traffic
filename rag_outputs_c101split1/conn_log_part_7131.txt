Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 0, and 1. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 1 is Destination Unreachable or other control messages, none of which indicate a ping flood.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a source to a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. However, the presence of ICMP type 11 and 1 messages could indicate network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics but not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages to check for possible routing loops or TTL expiry issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request floods (type 8) to detect potential ping flood attacks.
