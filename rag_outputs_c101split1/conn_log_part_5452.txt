Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8 or not present at all, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN or SYN-ACK flags with no anomalies or flood patterns visible.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No heuristic or taxonomy data is available from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Without explicit anomaly records, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates or other ICMP types.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
