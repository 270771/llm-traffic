Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a type field of 3 (indicated by the "3" in the fourth column), which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the safest conclusion is that this is normal ICMP error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from 5.131.34.101 to 202.101.173.138, as that would indicate potential ping flood activity. Also, investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages are symptomatic of network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.
