Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding: the number of packets and bytes are minimal (0 packets or 1 packet with 56 bytes), and there is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination. The first entry with ICMP type 11 is unrelated to ping floods, as it is a Time Exceeded message.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve high packet rates of ICMP type 8 from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates or volume spikes from any IPs. If sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic appears, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
