Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0, 1, and 3, but none with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 8 is the only type that indicates ping requests; other types represent replies or error messages (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 1 = Host Unreachable). Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for possible other ICMP-based issues, such as network misconfigurations or scanning activity, since types 1 and 3 indicate error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume thresholds to detect future ping floods promptly.
