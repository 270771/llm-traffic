Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.136.80 and destination IP 2.77.121.63 for unusual ICMP timestamp request volumes or other ICMP types that may indicate reconnaissance or timing-based attacks. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
