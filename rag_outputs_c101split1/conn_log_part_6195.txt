Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is "3" for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messaging.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP error messages from these IPs to detect potential emerging issues.
