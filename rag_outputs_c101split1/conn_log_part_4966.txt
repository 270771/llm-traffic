Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only, with no ICMP protocol records present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means the traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. However, the lack of ICMP traffic strongly indicates no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before logging.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP anomalies.
