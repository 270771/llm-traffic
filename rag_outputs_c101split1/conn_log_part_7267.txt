Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 150.227.97.96 and 14.162.95.116 to ensure it is legitimate, as ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply and could be part of normal communication or a response to prior pings. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic volume.
