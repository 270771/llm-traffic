Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, there is only a single echo request recorded with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a large number of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 125.177.188.57 repeatedly sends echo requests in a short period, which could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Check for other signs of ICMP-based attacks or network performance degradation.
