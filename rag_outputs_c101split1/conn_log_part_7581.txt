Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.251, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or volume indicators, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame.  
- Investigate if the source IP 151.105.96.5 generates a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in other logs.  
- Consider setting up rate-limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests if volume increases.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected anomaly.
