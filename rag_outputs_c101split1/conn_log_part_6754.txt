Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.227.90.79) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks).  
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 54.227.90.79 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.215.192, 133.243.82.109, 133.243.221.6, 133.243.168.159, 133.243.168.63, 133.243.225.43, 133.243.168.97, 133.243.179.249, 133.243.117.215, 133.243.222.119, 133.243.76.5, 133.243.76.8, 133.243.105.254, 133.243.162.123, 133.243.101.239, 133.243.154.212, 133.243.65.1, 133.243.78.51, 133.243.204.122, 133.243.72.78, 133.243.72.145, 133.243.68.176, 133.243.221.254  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.227.90.79.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust defenses accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.  
6. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
