Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No high volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) for volume spikes is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
