Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious ICMP or ping flood activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for other types of attacks suggested by TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, but current data shows no such clear attack pattern.
