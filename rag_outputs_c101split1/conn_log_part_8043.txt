Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not indicative of ping flood attacks. A ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), which are absent here.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The observed ICMP types correspond to normal network error or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as these could indicate network issues or reconnaissance activity, but no immediate attack is evident from this data.
