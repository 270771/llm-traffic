Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 is "Echo Reply," neither of which represent a flood of echo requests.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages (Destination Unreachable) to ensure no misconfigurations or network issues are causing excessive unreachable messages.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- Implement baseline traffic analysis to detect unusual ICMP patterns proactively.
