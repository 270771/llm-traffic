Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values observed in the conn.log snippet are 0, 3, 10, 11, and 13. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. The presence of other ICMP types (such as 3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded, 13 = Timestamp) indicates normal or other diagnostic ICMP traffic rather than a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs with ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure no underlying network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
