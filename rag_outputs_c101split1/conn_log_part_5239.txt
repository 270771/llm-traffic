Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs or other network captures for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm if any ping flood activity exists. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP traffic volume.
