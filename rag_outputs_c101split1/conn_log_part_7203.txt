Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet (count 1) with a duration of 0.926778 seconds and 224 bytes, which is insufficient to indicate flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that a ping flood requires multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets, which are not observed here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 210.162.64.2 sending ICMP Echo Requests if the volume increases.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests exceeding normal thresholds.
