Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed repeatedly at the single destination IP 18.55.153.245 from multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 130.187.19.214, 130.187.24.3, 130.187.24.225, and many others). This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP flood detection: multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from many sources targeting a single victim IP in a short time frame.  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.  
- Heuristic number: Assign heuristic #1 (High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target).

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 18.55.153.245 (target of all ICMP Echo Requests)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 130.187.19.214, 130.187.24.3, 130.187.24.225, 130.187.239.145, 130.187.28.25, 130.187.233.222, 130.187.229.91, 130.187.20.32, 130.187.19.241, 130.187.195.67, 130.187.20.193, 130.187.49.50, 130.187.29.28, 130.187.29.4, 130.187.49.1, among others.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 18.55.153.245.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.  
5. Consider blacklisting or quarantining the identified source IPs temporarily while investigating.  
6. Review and harden the target hostâ€™s ICMP handling policies (e.g., disable ICMP Echo Reply if not needed).
