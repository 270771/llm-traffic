Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping traffic relevant to a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - From 172.23.68.231 to 163.45.43.103  
  - From 203.78.143.78 to 193.158.96.1  
- However, these are isolated single connection records with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The third entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs at high frequency.  
- Investigate if these IPs generate bursts of ICMP Echo Requests over a short time window.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential flooding patterns.
