Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but only two have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. However, the volume and frequency of these ICMP type 8 packets are very low (only single entries within milliseconds), and there is no indication of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target that would characterize a ping flood. The other entries have ICMP types 3 and 1, which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which may indicate network issues but not an attack by itself.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 messages for possible network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
