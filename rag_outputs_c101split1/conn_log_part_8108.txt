Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has type 128 (indicated by the Zeek ICMP type field), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, but not type 8 (ICMP Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP packets and no other suspicious indicators, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or any other clear attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any other logs showing ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same or other IPs. Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in network load that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks.
