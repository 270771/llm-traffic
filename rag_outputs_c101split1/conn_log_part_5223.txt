Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state further, as this may indicate a port scan or other reconnaissance behavior. Focus on IPs such as 89.247.69.149 and 89.247.66.138 for potential scanning activity. Look for additional logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
