Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.140.173 and destination IP 167.246.129.121 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages, but no immediate attack response is warranted.
