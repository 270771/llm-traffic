Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 0, 1, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, type 1 is Destination Unreachable, and type 3 is also Destination Unreachable, indicating no flood of Echo Requests.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), with no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity, as ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) may indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
