Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 195.241.101.215 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for any other suspicious activity or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for ICMP Echo Requests or high ICMP traffic volume. Also, monitor for any other unusual ICMP types or patterns that could indicate different ICMP-based attacks.
