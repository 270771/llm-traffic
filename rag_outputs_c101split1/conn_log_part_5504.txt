Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports that no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.
- The TCP entries show many connection attempts with S0 (SYN sent, no reply) states, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these TCP connection attempts would be reconnaissance or scanning activity, not a flooding attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on these TCP connection attempts.
