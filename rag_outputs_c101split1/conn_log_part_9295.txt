Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would have protocol number 1, but the conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- The UDP traffic is mostly from source IP 45.121.95.154 to various destination IPs on port 5060, which is commonly SIP signaling, not ICMP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern does not match known ping flood characteristics (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).

No anomalies or heuristics related to ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Apply heuristics for UDP flood or SIP attack detection if available.
