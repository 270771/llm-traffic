Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3` (third field after source IP and port), which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 3 indicates error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there is ICMP Destination Unreachable traffic between 203.145.55.236 and 74.62.17.63, as frequent ICMP errors can indicate network misconfigurations or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
