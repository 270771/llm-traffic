Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 103.153.225.5, with a single packet and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods as per the given rule.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests for volume spikes could be a prudent next step to detect potential future ping floods.
