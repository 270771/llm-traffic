Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.  

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or firewall logs to confirm scanning behavior.  
- Apply heuristics related to scanning (e.g., repeated failed connection attempts) once available.  

Heuristic and taxonomy for scanning typically represent reconnaissance activity aimed at discovering open ports or services, distinct from flooding attacks.
