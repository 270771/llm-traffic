Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
Multiple ICMP connections are targeting the same destination IP (54.183.178.87) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. The rapid succession of these packets from different source IPs (157.206.12.163, 157.206.12.66, 157.206.121.230, 157.206.159.94) to the same target indicates a distributed ping flood pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #3 in many frameworks: "ICMP Echo Request flood"). The taxonomy class is "Network DoS" or "Volumetric Attack."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Sources: 157.206.12.163, 157.206.12.66, 157.206.121.230, 157.206.159.94  
- Destination: 54.183.178.87  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.183.178.87 at the network perimeter firewall or router.  
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.  
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other network logs for potential escalation.  
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.  
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and to investigate if these sources are compromised hosts.
