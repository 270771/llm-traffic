Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with ICMP type values 3, 1, and 8 respectively. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic can indicate a ping flood. Here, there is only one record with ICMP type 8 (from 172.23.68.231 to 202.250.197.163), and it does not show characteristics of flooding such as a high volume of repeated requests or rapid succession. The other two entries are ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 1 (ICMP Echo Reply), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy, a ping flood would fall under "Denial of Service" (DoS) attacks and heuristic related to "ICMP Echo Request flood."

Next steps:  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 entry for frequency and volume over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate ping attempts.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) to the same destination (202.250.197.163).  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for potential DoS symptoms.

No current evidence supports a ping flood attack in this snippet.
