Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded, and without heuristic or taxonomy context, no other attack type can be confidently inferred from this single entry. The connection state "OTH" and flags do not indicate flooding behavior.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 requests from the same source IP to the destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests.
