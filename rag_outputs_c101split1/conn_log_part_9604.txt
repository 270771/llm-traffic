Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column (value after source IP). The entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are present from source IP 18.72.141.69 to multiple destination IPs, but the number of connections is very low (only 3 entries), and the packet counts are minimal (56 bytes each, single packets). There is no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood attack.

Other ICMP types (11, 58) are present but do not indicate ping flood since only type 8 is relevant for ping flood detection.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests means no ping flood or similar volumetric ICMP attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 18.72.141.69 for unusual scanning or reconnaissance activity, as multiple ICMP Echo Requests to different destinations may indicate probing.  
- Collect more data or enable threshold-based alerts for ICMP Echo Request floods to detect future attacks.
