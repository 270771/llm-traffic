Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which is "3" for both source and destination ports. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the ICMP type 3 traffic likely represents normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or routing issues exist. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
