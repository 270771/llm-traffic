Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic does not contain ICMP Echo Requests, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of suspicious ICMP Echo Request traffic, no attack is present.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8) from the source IP 157.206.89.156 to the destination 54.183.178.87, as a surge in such packets could indicate the start of a ping flood. Also, consider enabling more detailed ICMP traffic logging to detect potential future attacks.
