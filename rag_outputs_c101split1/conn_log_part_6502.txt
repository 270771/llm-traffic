Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 0 and 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 1 is typically an ICMP error message (e.g., destination unreachable), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.169 sending ICMP type 1 messages, which could indicate network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
