Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. However, ICMP type 13 traffic could be part of network reconnaissance or time synchronization probes, which may warrant monitoring but are not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP type 13 messages from 133.227.136.80 to 109.18.27.102. If volume spikes or correlates with other suspicious activity, consider deeper packet inspection or rate limiting ICMP timestamp requests.
