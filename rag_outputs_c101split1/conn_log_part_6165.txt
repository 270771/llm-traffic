Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (99.92.87.186 and 3.6.128.5) for potential network misconfigurations or scanning behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns that could indicate a developing attack.
