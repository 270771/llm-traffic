Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 from 72.17.129.169 to 203.78.135.92, which is an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 133.243.232.165 to 173.20.116.218. The presence of a single echo request and a single echo reply, with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from one source to one destination, does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a large volume of ICMP type 8 packets overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to a single destination at high frequency. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or denial-of-service activity.
