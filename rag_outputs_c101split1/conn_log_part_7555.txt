Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or scanning but is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 42.179.76.90 for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious activity, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
