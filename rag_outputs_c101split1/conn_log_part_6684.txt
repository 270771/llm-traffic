Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state "OTH" (other) and flags do not indicate a flood pattern.

No other attack type is evident from this single ICMP Echo Reply record. Further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) or to the same destination (133.105.248.251) to detect potential flooding behavior.
