Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded messages, which are typically related to network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.  

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic is generally considered normal or diagnostic rather than malicious.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
