Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a destination port of 0 and no ICMP type explicitly listed as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the ICMP type and payload. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from 133.227.58.122 to 135.242.53.186 to rule out other ICMP-based attacks.
