Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP types 13 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (type 13 is Timestamp Request, type 0 is Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose and frequency of these ICMP messages to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations, but no immediate attack response is warranted.
