Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple TCP and UDP connection attempts, but no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The only UDP entries have destination ports like 53 and 1900, which correspond to DNS and SSDP services, not ICMP.  
- The TCP entries show many SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts, but these are not related to ICMP ping floods.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed traffic pattern aligns more with network scanning or reconnaissance rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) from IPs such as 89.247.69.180 and others, as this may indicate a scanning or brute force attempt.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning (commonly heuristic #6 in many taxonomies) and classify under reconnaissance or scanning taxonomy class.
