Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `8` for both entries, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern shown here are minimalâ€”only two ICMP echo requests to different destination IPs within a very short time frame. This does not match the high-rate, sustained traffic pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without additional evidence of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP echo requests, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 151.105.96.5. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or scanning activity.
