Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 203.78.242.129, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 3 and 11 often relate to network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination at a high rate. If volume spikes, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, verify if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages are part of legitimate network diagnostics or indicate misconfigurations.
