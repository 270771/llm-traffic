Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All provided Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; none show ICMP traffic. Specifically, there is no record of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not flooding or denial-of-service via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential TCP SYN scan or SYN flood activity. Collect ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm or rule out ICMP-based attacks.
