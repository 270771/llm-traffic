Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.  
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), typical of scanning or failed connection attempts, not ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no taxonomy class applies here.  
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with port scanning or reconnaissance attempts rather than flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 (SIP signaling port), which may indicate suspicious VoIP scanning or enumeration.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or IDS rules to capture and alert on ICMP Echo Request floods.
