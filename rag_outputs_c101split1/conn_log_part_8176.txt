Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.115.192, 133.227.62.29, 133.227.182.249, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IPs (notably 44.195.45.212 and 3.203.247.100) in a very short time window (all timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.
- Assign heuristic number: 101 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: DoS/Disruption.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.115.192, 133.227.62.29, 133.227.182.249, 133.243.245.134, 133.243.194.124, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 44.195.45.212 and 3.203.247.100.
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor affected hosts (44.195.45.212 and 3.203.247.100) for service degradation or outages.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools such as blackholing or scrubbing services.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within your network or external attackers.
