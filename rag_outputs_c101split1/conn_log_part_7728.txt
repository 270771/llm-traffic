Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No continuous or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 and 0 are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.  
- Monitor for spikes in ICMP Echo Requests volume or rate.  
- Correlate with network performance issues or alerts from IDS/IPS systems.
