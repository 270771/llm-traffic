Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 129.1.137.57 and destination IP 163.45.166.251 for any unusual traffic patterns or repeated ICMP Echo Replies that might indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse. Collect more detailed ICMP type data to confirm if any Echo Requests are present.
