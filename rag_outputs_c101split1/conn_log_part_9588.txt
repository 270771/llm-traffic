Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (54.254.197.94) sending numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) to multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.0077 seconds per packet). This pattern of high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets to many targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.254.197.94; targets include multiple 163.45.x.x IPs (e.g., 163.45.7.96, 163.45.101.39, 163.45.35.6, etc.). ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.254.197.94 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., threshold-based alerts, traffic shaping).
  4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Conduct a forensic review to determine if the source IP is spoofed or compromised and take appropriate remediation steps.
