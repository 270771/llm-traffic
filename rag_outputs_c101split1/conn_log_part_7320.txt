Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is the 4th column in the Zeek conn.log snippet. The only entry with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the first line:  
  `203.78.143.78 (type 8) -> 61.164.17.2`  
- However, this single ICMP Echo Request does not indicate flooding. The other entries have ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession or other indicators, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from any source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages for potential network issues or other attack types such as traceroute or scanning activity.  
- Establish heuristics to flag excessive ICMP Echo Requests per source IP to detect future ping floods.
