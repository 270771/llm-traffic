Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the log is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 133.227.58.120 and 125.26.199.248 to determine if it is part of a different ICMP-based anomaly or misconfiguration. Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information and monitor for volume spikes or repeated patterns.
