Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 or 11 (the 7th field after source IP is the ICMP type). None of the entries show ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, these ICMP packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets (types 0, 1, 11) to determine if they correspond to legitimate responses or other ICMP message types (e.g., Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded).  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
