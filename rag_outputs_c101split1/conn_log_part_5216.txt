Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state) and some REJ or RSTR responses, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or volumetric attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm if any ICMP flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious ICMP types.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for alerts related to ICMP or volumetric attacks.
