Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but the logs show only two isolated ICMP connections with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. There is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state "OTH" and flags do not indicate an ongoing flood.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, re-evaluate for ping flood patterns. Also, investigate if these isolated ICMP packets correlate with other suspicious activity or reconnaissance attempts.
