Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), also not type 8.  
- No anomalies or heuristics are provided, and no evidence of excessive ICMP Echo Requests is present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. Both ICMP types 3 and 11 are normal control messages used in network diagnostics and error reporting.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. However, these ICMP types typically fall under normal network operations or benign error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs including ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods.
