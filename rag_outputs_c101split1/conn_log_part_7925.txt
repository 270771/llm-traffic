Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other signs of flooding, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time frame.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- If high ICMP traffic volume is detected later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify accordingly.
