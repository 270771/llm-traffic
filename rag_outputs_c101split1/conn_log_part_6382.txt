Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the ICMP code field being 0 and no explicit type 8 for echo request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state "OTH" and flags "F F" indicate other ICMP traffic, possibly error or reply messages, not a flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent legitimate network diagnostics or other ICMP-based activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
