Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest these packets are error or control messages rather than flood attempts.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network issues or reconnaissance activities. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent to detect any future ping flood attempts.
