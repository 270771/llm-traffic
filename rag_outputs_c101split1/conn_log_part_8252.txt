Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before Zeek processing.
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to capture potential ping floods.
- Monitor for other attack types such as TCP SYN floods, which may be indicated by many S0 (SYN sent, no response) states in the TCP connections here.
- If TCP SYN flood is suspected, apply heuristics related to SYN flood detection and taxonomy class for DoS attacks.
