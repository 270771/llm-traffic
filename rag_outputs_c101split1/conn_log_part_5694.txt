Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields (source port 11, destination port 0), but these do not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP traffic with type other than 8 to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or misconfigurations. Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in future logs for precise analysis.
