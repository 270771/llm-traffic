Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood but rather error or control messages.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP behavior:

- ICMP type 8 = Echo Request (ping)
- ICMP type 0 = Echo Reply
- ICMP type 3 = Destination Unreachable
- ICMP type 1 = Host Unreachable

Next steps:  
Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages (types 1 and 3) between these IPs, as this could indicate network misconfiguration, routing issues, or a different type of network problem. Monitoring for repeated ICMP error messages or unusual ICMP traffic volume could help detect other anomalies.
