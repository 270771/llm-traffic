Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (value 3), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other types of attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific alternative attack classification can be assigned. The ICMP type 3 typically indicates a "Destination Unreachable" message, which is normal network behavior and not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 3 messages or other ICMP types that could indicate network issues or other attack vectors. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods in the future.
