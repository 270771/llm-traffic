Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeekâ€™s conn.log may not fully capture ICMP flows unless configured.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks suggested by the TCP connection failures (S0 states), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but are not ping floods.
