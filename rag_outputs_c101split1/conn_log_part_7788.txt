Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, there is only a single such event recorded, not a flood or high volume of repeated requests from one source to one destination. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. The absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination indicates no ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would require detection of high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume and latency metrics to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP type 3 messages for possible network misconfigurations or other issues.
