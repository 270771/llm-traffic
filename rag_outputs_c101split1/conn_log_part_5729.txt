Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with source IPs 189.185.218.103 and 203.78.143.78).  
- However, these entries show very low packet counts (1 and 0 packets respectively) and no signs of high-volume repetitive traffic typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 10) indicate destination unreachable or other control messages, not echo requests.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), with no flags or retransmissions indicating flooding behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, ping flood heuristics involve high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source or multiple sources targeting the same destination.  
- Investigate the sources 189.185.218.103 and 203.78.143.78 for any unusual ICMP activity over time.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
