Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known attack patterns can be made.  

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the given data, no immediate security incident is present.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.105.128.252 and 133.243.16.162) for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or stealthy scanning.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes, which would be indicative of ping floods.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP traffic volume and type to detect future anomalies.
