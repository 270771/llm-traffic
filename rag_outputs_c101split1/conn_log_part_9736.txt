Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.249.88.129) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.249.88.129  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.225.43, 163.45.152.2, 163.45.225.2, 163.45.91.217, 163.45.15.142, 163.45.91.242, 163.45.75.39, 163.45.75.196, 163.45.75.108, 163.45.69.1, 163.45.168.25, 163.45.168.231, 163.45.54.254, 163.45.15.103, 163.45.124.249, 163.45.34.254, 163.45.188.171, 163.45.49.2  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.88.129 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from other sources.  
3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Implement or verify existing ICMP rate-limiting policies on routers and switches to mitigate volumetric ICMP floods.  
5. Conduct a forensic review of logs to identify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.  
6. Consider deploying anomaly-based detection tools to alert on similar high-rate ICMP traffic patterns in the future.
