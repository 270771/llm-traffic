Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries show mostly connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture potential ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that may indicate a SYN flood or scanning activity, which would fall under heuristic classes related to DoS or reconnaissance if such context becomes available.
