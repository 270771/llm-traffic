Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic shows a single ICMP packet with type 11, which is normal network behavior related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not a flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 11 messages, which could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.
