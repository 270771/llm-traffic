Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Among the ICMP entries, only one record shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, there is only a single such entry (from 133.243.9.5 to 54.227.90.79) and no evidence of a high volume or rapid repetition of ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate a flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, and 11, which are not echo requests and thus do not represent ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The lack of multiple ICMP type 8 packets or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet if it is unexpected in the environment, but no immediate attack is detected.
