Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type values of 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages or could indicate other network issues but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. However, the presence of multiple ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) could warrant further investigation into network reachability or routing issues.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these IPs. Investigate network devices or paths related to these IPs for potential misconfigurations or failures causing ICMP errors.
