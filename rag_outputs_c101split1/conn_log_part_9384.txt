Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping) packets. However, the volume and pattern in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP echo requests from different source IPs to the same destination IP, with no indication of rapid, repeated, or volumetric traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review network traffic for other ICMP types or unusual connection states that might indicate different attack vectors.
