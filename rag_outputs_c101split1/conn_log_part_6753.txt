Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.227.90.79) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp (all around 1641013210.84). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 54.227.90.79 (ICMP type 8, no ports as ICMP is connectionless)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.100.251, 133.243.25.70, 133.243.181.147, 133.243.100.239, 133.243.181.33, 133.243.179.255, 133.243.162.52, 133.243.92.204, 133.243.162.102, 133.243.204.128, 133.243.167.171, 133.243.193.28, 133.243.100.238, 133.243.214.19, 133.243.92.128, 133.243.92.228, 133.243.204.134, 133.243.214.251, 133.243.135.185, 133.243.255.125, 133.243.214.139, 133.243.25.40, 133.243.193.111.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.  
4. Monitor the victim host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim if business operations allow.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and take remediation actions accordingly.
