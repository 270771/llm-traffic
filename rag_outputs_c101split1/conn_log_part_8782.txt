Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port value "11" and destination port "0". ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood, but here the source port is 11, which corresponds to ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 traffic between 203.78.140.213 and 178.14.222.26 to ensure it is legitimate network diagnostic traffic and not part of a different ICMP-based attack or misconfiguration.
