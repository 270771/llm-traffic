Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood, but the other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- The traffic volume and timing do not indicate a flood pattern; only single or very few ICMP packets are logged with no signs of rapid repetition or high packet rate.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high frequency from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.120 sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual for the network environment, as it may indicate routing or network misconfiguration issues.
