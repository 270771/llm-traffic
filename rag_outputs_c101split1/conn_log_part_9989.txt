Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from IP 54.251.127.36 targeting multiple destination IPs (203.78.128.240, 203.78.160.5, 203.78.142.123, 203.78.152.1, 203.78.128.75, 203.78.162.33) in rapid succession (timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP 54.251.127.36; multiple victim/destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms these are Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 54.251.127.36 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP floods or other volumetric attacks.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if attack volume escalates.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic.
