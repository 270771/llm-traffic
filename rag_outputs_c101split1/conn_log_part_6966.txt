Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, these ICMP messages could indicate network issues or misconfigurations worth investigating further.

Next steps: Review network device logs and routing configurations to understand the cause of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
