Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections with no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy classes are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP connection attempts with S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Specifically, review source IPs such as 89.247.69.180 and 89.247.69.146 that appear multiple times with failed TCP connections.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for potential scanning or other attack types.
