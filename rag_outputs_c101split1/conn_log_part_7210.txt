Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0 and 11, but none with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. ICMP type 8 is the only type that indicates ping requests; types 0 (Echo Reply) and 11 (Time Exceeded) do not represent ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages, as they may indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If suspicious activity arises, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance once available.
