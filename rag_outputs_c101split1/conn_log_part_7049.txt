Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 6th column after source IP and port) is `0` and `1` respectively, not `8`. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and neither entry is type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP behavior, only type 8 packets indicate ping requests, which are necessary for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another anomaly.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual volume from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
