Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from 133.243.71.2 to 185.183.48.120, with 224 packets over nearly one second, which is moderately high but not conclusively a flood by itself. Other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods. There is no evidence of sustained, high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources or a single source that would indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ICMP Flood," but these cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps: Monitor the source IP 133.243.71.2 for increased ICMP Echo Request rates and check for any correlated network degradation or alerts. Investigate if this traffic pattern persists or escalates to confirm potential attack activity.
