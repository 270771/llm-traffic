Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.
- The traffic mostly involves UDP port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP ports, none related to ICMP.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no classification applies.
- The observed traffic may warrant investigation for SIP-related scanning or reconnaissance due to repeated UDP attempts to port 5060, but this is not a ping flood.

Next Steps:
- Monitor for actual ICMP Echo Request traffic to detect ping floods.
- Investigate the repeated UDP attempts to port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or DoS attempts.
- Enable logging or anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to capture potential ping flood patterns.
