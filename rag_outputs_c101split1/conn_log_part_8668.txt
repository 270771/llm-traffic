Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1 or 3 (destination unreachable or other control messages), but none have ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The presence of multiple ICMP connections alone does not indicate a ping flood without echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 1 and 3 messages to determine if they indicate network misconfigurations or other issues such as unreachable hosts or routing problems.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
