Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry from 202.28.64.96 to 203.78.143.78 has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second ICMP entry from 203.78.143.78 to 38.108.238.253 has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- Since neither entry is ICMP type 8, these packets do not represent a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may be normal ICMP diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) elsewhere in the logs to rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.  
- If ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets are frequent, consider investigating possible traceroute activity or network issues causing TTL expiration.
