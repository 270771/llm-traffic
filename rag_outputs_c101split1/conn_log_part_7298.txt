Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the destination port field (which is 0 here, typically representing ICMP type/code). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and codes. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns that may indicate reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
