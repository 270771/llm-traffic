Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1, which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) typically sent rapidly from one source to a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 1 messages are being generated from 182.159.72.230 to 203.78.132.112, as frequent Destination Unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
