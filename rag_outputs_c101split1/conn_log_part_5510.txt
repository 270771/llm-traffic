Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts. Also, correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context.
