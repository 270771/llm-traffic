Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
Multiple distinct source IPs (133.227.176.1, 133.227.244.254, 133.227.63.205, 133.227.207.8, 133.227.203.11) are sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to the same destination IP (3.23.69.72) within a very short time frame. This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attackers: 133.227.176.1, 133.227.244.254, 133.227.63.205, 133.227.207.8, 133.227.203.11  
- Victim: 3.23.69.72  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor the victim host (3.23.69.72) for performance degradation and consider temporarily blocking all ICMP traffic if service impact is severe.  
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall rules accordingly.
