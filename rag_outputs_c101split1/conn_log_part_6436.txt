Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows traffic from 17.33.253.167 to 203.78.143.78 with ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an Echo Request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry shows traffic from 50.246.165.101 to 203.78.135.92 with ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request.  
- Since neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), the traffic does not match the required pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed, this traffic could be related to diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure no routing loops or misconfigurations are causing excessive Time Exceeded packets.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts promptly.
