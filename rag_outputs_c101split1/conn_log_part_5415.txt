Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (e.g., icmp.log) are available to confirm the presence or absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, as many connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if such patterns persist.
