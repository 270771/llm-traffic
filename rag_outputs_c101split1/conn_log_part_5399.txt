Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify ping floods. There are no ICMP entries or anomalies related to ICMP traffic in the provided data.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these attempts are malicious. Look specifically for ICMP traffic in future logs to detect ping floods.
