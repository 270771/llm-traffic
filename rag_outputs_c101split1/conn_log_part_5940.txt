Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic likely represents diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or routing loops. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
