Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.183.178.87) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.206.x.x range (e.g., 157.206.82.252, 157.206.124.226, 157.206.234.255, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.183.178.87 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host (54.183.178.87) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or tune DDoS mitigation tools to absorb or deflect the flood.
  5. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses for further remediation.
