Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would require ICMP type 8) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm no ICMP flood activity.  
- Monitor for other types of suspicious TCP connection attempts, as many entries show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scans or connection attempts if available.
