Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No continuous or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

Since no anomalies are found and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match other common attack patterns based on the given data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP Time Exceeded messages (type 11) indicate possible traceroute activity or network issues.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
