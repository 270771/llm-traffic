Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are visible, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be a series of TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods. If ICMP logs become available, verify ICMP type fields to detect ping floods accurately.
