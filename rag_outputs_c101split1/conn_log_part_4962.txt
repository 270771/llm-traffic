Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these entries would be "TCP SYN scan" or "connection attempts," which is different from ICMP flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion to rule out port scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture any potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection attempts.
