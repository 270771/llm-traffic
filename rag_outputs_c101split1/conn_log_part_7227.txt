Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping requests. However, these entries do not show a high volume or rapid repetition indicative of a flood. The other entries have ICMP types 0, 3, and 10, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from single sources to single destinations.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated OTH (other) connection states.  
- If future logs show sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, apply heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" for further action.
