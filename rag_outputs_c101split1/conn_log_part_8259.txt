Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic in the log shows type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP type 3 traffic typically indicates network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 131.140.172.252 and destination IP 185.138.73.88 for potential scanning or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
