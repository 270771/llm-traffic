Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries show type 3 (Destination Unreachable) rather than type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. The traffic appears to be a series of ICMP error messages, possibly indicating network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy: Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, ICMP type 3 traffic typically aligns with network reconnaissance or error reporting rather than flooding attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.145.55.236 for potential scanning or misconfiguration causing multiple ICMP unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
