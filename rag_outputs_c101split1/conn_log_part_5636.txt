Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the port fields which are 3 and 1; typically, ICMP type is in the "sport" field for ICMP, here source port is 3 and destination port is 1, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 or 1). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned, but the absence of ICMP type 8 excludes ping flood.

No attack is present based on this data. Further investigation could focus on the nature of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) messages to understand if there is a network issue or misconfiguration causing these ICMP errors.
