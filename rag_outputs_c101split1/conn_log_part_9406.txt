Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IPs (notably 69.232.167.15 and 3.39.157.141) within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.203â€“1641013233.206).
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.91.2, 133.243.210.178, 157.206.121.224, 157.206.216.210, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to the same destination IPs, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all these entries, confirming these are ping requests, which matches the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a classic ICMP flood heuristic, which is typically assigned heuristic number 1001 (ICMP Flood) in common taxonomies.
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, as ping floods aim to overwhelm the target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IPs: 69.232.167.15 and 3.39.157.141 (ICMP has no ports, so port fields are 0 or not applicable).
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.91.2, 133.243.210.178, 133.243.195.174, 157.206.121.224, 157.206.216.210, 157.206.244.125, 157.206.248.172, and others in the 133.243.x.x and 157.206.x.x ranges.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation and prepare to apply temporary blackholing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within your network or external.
- Update firewall rules to restrict ICMP traffic to only necessary hosts or networks.
