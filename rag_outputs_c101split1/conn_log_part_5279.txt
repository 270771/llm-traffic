Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8 or not present at all, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The traffic appears to be mostly failed or incomplete TCP connection attempts (S0, SH states), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 (SYN sent, no response) and SH (SYN sent, RST received) states for possible port scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP traffic specifically to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- If available, correlate with firewall or IDS logs for suspicious ICMP or other protocol anomalies.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of anomaly data and context.
