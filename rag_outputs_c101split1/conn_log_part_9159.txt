Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The traffic consists mainly of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP), but these do not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood or ICMP anomalies are detected, no relevant heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed traffic could be related to scanning or SIP-related activity, which may warrant further investigation.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or abuse.
- Monitor TCP SYN attempts for possible reconnaissance or scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts explicitly.
