Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0 or 3, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries have type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

The observed ICMP types:  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  

These types indicate normal ICMP responses or error messages, not an attack involving excessive Echo Requests.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy entries are available from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. However, ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is often associated with network troubleshooting or misconfiguration rather than an attack. No anomaly records were found to suggest suspicious behavior.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages (130.187.195.244 to 103.237.156.234) to ensure no underlying network issues or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood attempts.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume thresholds to detect future ping floods promptly.
