Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.147.13 to destination 163.84.73.84, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 11 and 8 but do not show multiple repeated attempts or volume consistent with flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic context, the default assumption is that isolated ICMP Echo Requests are normal network activity, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection states.  
- If future logs show multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests from a single source, apply heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" for further action.
