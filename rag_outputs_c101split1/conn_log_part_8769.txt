Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other) and the flags indicate only single packets with no evidence of rapid, repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. There is no indication of high volume or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without repeated or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a surge in Echo Requests is observed, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these isolated pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics.
