Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicative of scanning or reconnaissance, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential SYN scan or DoS activity. Correlate with firewall logs or IDS alerts for SYN flood or port scan heuristics. Monitor for ICMP traffic spikes to detect any future ping flood attempts.
