Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood attack. Ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target, which is not indicated here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is an ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks like Smurf or ICMP flood.

No immediate attack is present. However, further investigation could include monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 157.206.205.145 to 54.203.14.148 to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
