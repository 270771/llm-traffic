Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with flags like S0 (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or volumetric ICMP attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could relate to reconnaissance heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as absence here does not guarantee no ICMP flood.  
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IPs.
