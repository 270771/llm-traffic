Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and no ICMP traffic is logged here, no ping flood can be detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack types. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related anomalies. If scanning activity is suspected from the TCP SYN attempts, consider applying heuristics related to port scanning or reconnaissance.
