Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1, 3, 11, or 0, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required to identify an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. ICMP types 1 (destination unreachable), 3 (destination unreachable), 11 (time exceeded), and 0 (echo reply) do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.229.227 and others for potential ICMP error message floods or other ICMP-based reconnaissance, as multiple ICMP error types are present. Monitoring for unusual volumes or patterns of ICMP error messages could reveal other network issues or attacks.
