Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which are necessary indicators of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP type 11 corresponds to diagnostic messages, not attacks, and type 8 alone does not confirm flooding without volume or frequency data.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time frame to detect potential ping flood attempts. Collect volume and rate metrics to confirm flooding behavior.
