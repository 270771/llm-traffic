Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 121.47.230.182 for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious behavior, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests that could signal an emerging ping flood.
