Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections with no indication of ICMP traffic, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The absence of ICMP records means no ping flood pattern is present.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate further by collecting and analyzing ICMP-specific logs or Zeek icmp.log data to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods. Also, monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that could indicate a SYN scan or SYN flood attack, which would fall under heuristic class related to TCP scanning or DoS attempts.
