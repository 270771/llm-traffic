Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection state is OTH (other), and there is only a single packet per connection (last field = 1), indicating no rapid or repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination. A ping flood attack typically involves a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to overwhelm the target, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate a ping flood or other attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If multiple repeated ICMP echo requests are detected in a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate the OTH connection states to understand why these ICMP packets are not completing normal connection states.
