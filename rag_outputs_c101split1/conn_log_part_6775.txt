Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP: 35.87.78.209.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.227.x.x subnet are sending ICMP Echo Requests almost simultaneously, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type that qualifies as ping requests; all entries match this type, confirming the traffic is ping-related.
- The volume and concentration of these requests on one target IP strongly indicate a ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single victim.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood.
- Heuristic number: Assign heuristic #1 (ICMP Flood Detection) as the most likely given the pattern.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 35.87.78.209 (destination of all ICMP Echo Requests)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in 133.227.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.227.207.0, 133.227.129.145, 133.227.207.8, etc.)
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.87.78.209.
2. Deploy ingress filtering to prevent spoofed ICMP traffic from leaving internal networks.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or mitigate attack traffic upstream if possible.
5. Harden the target host by disabling unnecessary ICMP responses or using ICMP rate limiting on the host itself.
6. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are part of a botnet or compromised systems for remediation.

This targeted and coordinated ICMP Echo Request flood matches classic ping flood attack behavior and requires immediate mitigation to prevent denial of service.
