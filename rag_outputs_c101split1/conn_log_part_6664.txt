Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is likely error messages rather than ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" (other) and flags do not indicate a flood pattern.

No ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here. Further investigation could focus on why ICMP type 3 messages are generated—potentially network misconfigurations or scanning activity—but no immediate attack is evident.
