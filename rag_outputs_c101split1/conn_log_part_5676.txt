Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate an ongoing ping flood attack. No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 181.214.67.175 to the destination 203.78.143.78, as that would be indicative of a ping flood. Additionally, reviewing traffic volume and rate metrics for ICMP Echo Requests would be prudent.
