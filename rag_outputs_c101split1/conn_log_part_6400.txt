Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request), except one entry with type 0 (Echo Reply) and others with type 1 or 2. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 2 (Redirect) traffic for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial activities.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume thresholds to detect future ping flood attempts promptly.
