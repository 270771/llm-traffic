Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections. Only one entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is from source IP 36.174.61.94 to destination 163.45.2.10. The other two entries have ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is not related to ping floods. A ping flood requires multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, indicating overwhelming traffic. Here, there is only a single echo request recorded, with no evidence of high volume or repeated requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets or high packet counts strongly indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time frame.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based anomalies, such as ICMP unreachable or time exceeded messages, which may indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
