Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available. The observed traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors from the same source IP (203.78.139.211) to the destination (185.90.33.44) to rule out other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
