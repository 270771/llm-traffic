Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 11 traffic is unusually high, which could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues, but it is not indicative of a ping flood. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and their frequency is recommended to detect actual ping flood attempts.
