Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which is `0` here. However, the ICMP type is not explicitly shown, but the conn.log format typically does not directly show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) in this snippet. The connection state is `OTH` (other), and the packet count is only 1, which is insufficient to indicate a flood. Additionally, the destination port is `0`, consistent with ICMP, but no repeated or high-volume traffic is evident.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.

Recommendation: Monitor the source IP 202.125.201.18 and destination 45.112.52.255 for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or volume spikes. Collect more detailed ICMP type information and volume metrics to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
