Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (indicated by the destination port field for ICMP), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 1 messages are being generated between 163.45.185.43 and 51.91.115.202, as frequent destination unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
