Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 151.235.222.254 to destination 133.251.124.29, with 224 packets and bytes, but this single connection does not show the characteristics of a flood (e.g., extremely high packet rate or multiple simultaneous echo requests). The other ICMP entries have types 0, 2, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Without evidence of sustained high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic or multiple sources targeting a single destination, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or multiple concurrent echo request streams from the same or multiple sources. Investigate the source 151.235.222.254 if the volume increases or if other suspicious behaviors emerge.
