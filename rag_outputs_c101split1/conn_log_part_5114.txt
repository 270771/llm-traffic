Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0) for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks is recommended. If ICMP traffic logs become available, specifically check for ICMP type 8 packets to detect ping floods.
