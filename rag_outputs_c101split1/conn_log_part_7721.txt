Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match a ping flood but could indicate other ICMP activity such as traceroute or diagnostic messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are any ICMP Echo Request packets in a broader timeframe or other logs to confirm no ping flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that might indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
