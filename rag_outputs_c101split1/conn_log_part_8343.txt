Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 13. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request," neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity related to these IPs or ports. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this traffic is normal or related to other ICMP functions.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or alerts for comprehensive analysis.
