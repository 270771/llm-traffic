Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 7th column after source and destination IPs and ports) is not explicitly listed as type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood. The entries show ICMP with type values 3 and 0, which correspond to Destination Unreachable and Echo Reply respectively, not Echo Request.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as a high volume could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in logs for precise detection.
