Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP connections are targeting the same destination IP 3.17.238.136 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping.
- The source IPs (130.187.195.129, 130.187.195.144, 130.187.37.240, 130.187.37.237) are sending repeated ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of multiple hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single target is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.
- Taxonomy class: **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attackers: 130.187.195.129, 130.187.195.144, 130.187.37.240, 130.187.37.237 (source IPs).
- Victim: 3.17.238.136 (destination IP).
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
- Notify network operations to consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if business impact is severe.
