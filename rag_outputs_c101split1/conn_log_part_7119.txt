Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state) but no sustained or volumetric ICMP traffic typical of ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as ping floods rely on ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from single IPs.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to complement Zeek data.
