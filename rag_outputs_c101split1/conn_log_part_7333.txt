Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is missing or unspecified in the Zeek conn.log snippet, but the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood. The log shows ICMP traffic with no explicit type 8, and only a single connection record is present, which does not indicate flooding behavior (high volume or rapid repeated requests). No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP connection record. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate additional logs for volume and frequency of ICMP Echo Requests from 133.227.102.209 to 222.189.226.118 to confirm if a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is occurring. Monitor for repeated OTH (other) connection states or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
