Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no evidence of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP echo requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. There is no anomaly data or heuristic context indicating suspicious behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristics are provided, no taxonomy class can be assigned. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require sustained, high-rate ICMP type 8 packets.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or volumetric ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs (e.g., 54.254.197.94) to the same destination. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks.
