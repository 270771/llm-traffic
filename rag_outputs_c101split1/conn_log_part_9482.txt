Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.198.197.73 from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013233.56xxxx). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic patterns for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.227.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.198.197.73. Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.198.197.73.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or further attack stages.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact on the targeted host and prepare mitigation steps such as traffic scrubbing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
