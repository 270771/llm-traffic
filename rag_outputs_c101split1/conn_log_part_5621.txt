Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

No specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned without further data. However, investigation should focus on verifying if the ICMP Time Exceeded messages are symptomatic of network misconfigurations or routing loops. Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
