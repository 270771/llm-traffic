Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11, 1, and 10, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, type 1 is an ICMP error (likely Destination Unreachable), and type 10 is a Router Advertisement. These do not indicate ping flood behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  

Since no ping flood or other clear ICMP-based attack is detected, no immediate security response is required. However, further investigation could focus on the source IPs sending unusual ICMP error messages (e.g., 219.129.148.90 sending type 11) to ensure they are not part of a reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  

Without heuristics or taxonomy data, no specific classification can be assigned. Next steps: monitor for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) spikes and correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential flooding.
