Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.7.51, 157.206.7.54, 157.206.1.20, etc.) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (54.183.178.87) within the same second (timestamp 1641013232). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one host is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy entries are found in the anomaly CSV, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 157.206.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.183.178.87. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.183.178.87.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to volumetric DDoS mitigation services.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
