Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (157.206.171.216, 157.206.58.131, 157.206.58.130, 157.206.154.190, 157.206.205.88) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (52.223.127.239) within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.206.171.216, 157.206.58.131, 157.206.58.130, 157.206.154.190, 157.206.205.88; Destination - 52.223.127.239; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential botnet involvement.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or abuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns automatically.
