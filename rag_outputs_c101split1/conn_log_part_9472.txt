Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or indicated as "-" (not type 8). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood. The entries show OTH (other) connection states with zero or very low packet counts, which is inconsistent with the high-volume ICMP Echo Requests typical of ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of type 8 ICMP packets rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further to determine if it corresponds to other ICMP-based reconnaissance or scanning activities.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- Collect additional logs or enable detailed ICMP type logging to better classify future events.
