Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries are type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) messages to ensure they are not part of other network issues or reconnaissance activities. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
