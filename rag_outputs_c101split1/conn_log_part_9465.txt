Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry from 202.250.230.253 to 209.86.136.209 shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Therefore, it does not match the ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP entry from 202.250.216.227 to 167.46.173.224 shows a fractional ICMP type field "8.952465," which is invalid or malformed; ICMP type must be an integer. This suggests either a logging anomaly or corrupted data, not a valid ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) with high volume and sustained rate indicates ping flood. Neither entry shows this clearly.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of the malformed ICMP type value (8.952465) for potential logging or parsing errors.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from any IP to detect future ping floods.  
- If ICMP type 11 traffic spikes abnormally, consider investigating traceroute or TTL-expired packet floods, which may indicate other reconnaissance or DoS attempts.
