Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown involves type 3 and type 8 messages. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the type 8 packets are isolated single events from IP 151.105.96.5 to two different destinations, with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The type 3 (Destination Unreachable) packet from 133.243.225.7 is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Request traffic is present, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
