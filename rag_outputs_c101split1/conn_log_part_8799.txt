Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP Echo Reply, not a flood of Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is a normal ICMP reply, it does not match ping flood or other known attack patterns.

No immediate security response is required. However, continuous monitoring of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) volume from the source IP 54.249.65.236 to destination 203.78.138.108 is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
