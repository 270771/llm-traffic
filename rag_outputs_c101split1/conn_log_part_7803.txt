Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.48, but there is only a single connection log entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types other than 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Given the data, no other attack pattern is clearly indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP at a high rate to detect potential ping floods. Correlate with volume metrics or alerts from IDS/IPS systems for more comprehensive detection.
