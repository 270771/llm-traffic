Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.  
- The logs show multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts with SYN or other flags, but these do not match ping flood characteristics.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. However, the observed traffic could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity (e.g., multiple SYN attempts with flag S0), which typically falls under heuristic categories related to port scanning or connection flooding, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from IP 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or abuse.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture echo request floods promptly.
