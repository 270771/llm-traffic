Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out by network devices.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP anomalies.
- Consider enabling ICMP logging if currently disabled to improve detection capabilities.
