Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP entries with types 128, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The single ICMP type 8 record (from 61.51.245.146 to 163.45.145.133) does not show a high volume or rapid repeated requests indicative of a flood. The other ICMP types (128 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages for possible traceroute or network issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 61.51.245.146 to detect potential future ping floods.
