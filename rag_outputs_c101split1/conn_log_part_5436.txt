Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes are available from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood heuristics.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm no ICMP-based attacks are occurring.  
- Monitor for other TCP-based anomalies such as SYN floods or port scans, as many connections show SYN_SENT (S0) states which could indicate scanning or connection attempts.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context for more precise detection in future analyses.
