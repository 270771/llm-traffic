Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 13, 0, and 3. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- ICMP type 13 is Timestamp Request  
- ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply  
- ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable  

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior related to these IPs or ports. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for potential other ICMP misuse or reconnaissance activity, as ICMP type 13 and 3 can be used in network mapping or scanning.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Consider enabling logging or alerting on unusual ICMP patterns beyond type 8 to detect other ICMP-based attacks.
