Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" (the 7th field after source IP and port), which is not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between these IPs to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different ICMP-based reconnaissance or response anomaly. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
