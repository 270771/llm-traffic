Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 129.1.135.255 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for other suspicious activity or repeated ICMP error messages, as frequent ICMP type 1 messages may indicate network issues or scanning behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
