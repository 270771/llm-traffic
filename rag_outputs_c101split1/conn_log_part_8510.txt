Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (3.243.126.119) targeting numerous destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid succession and volume of these echo requests to multiple targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 3.243.126.119  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 203.78.146.245, 203.78.141.158, 203.78.149.93, 203.78.149.119, 203.78.132.69, 203.78.135.92, 203.78.131.135, 203.78.141.242, 203.78.149.114, 203.78.131.142  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.243.126.119 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate ongoing flooding.  
2. Monitor network devices and affected hosts for signs of degradation or service impact.  
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events.  
4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
