Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 0 in the "id.orig_p" field (which is 11, the IP protocol number for ICMP, but no explicit ICMP type 8 is indicated). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not match the required condition for a ping flood attack. The logs show ICMP traffic but lack evidence of repeated Echo Requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets with no clear flooding pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details, including ICMP type and code fields, to confirm their purpose. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal traffic volume from these IPs (133.227.58.122, 133.227.58.120, 202.250.202.133) to destination IPs (180.187.124.5, 172.22.233.29, 211.8.69.103, 180.187.124.107).
