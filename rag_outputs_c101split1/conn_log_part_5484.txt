Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be a series of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (connection attempts without response) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Apply heuristics related to scanning behavior (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies) and classify under "Reconnaissance" or "Scanning" taxonomy. Further monitoring of ICMP traffic is advised to detect any future ping flood attempts.
