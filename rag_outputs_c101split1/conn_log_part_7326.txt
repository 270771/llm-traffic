Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods. The fields indicating ICMP type appear as numeric values "3" and "11" in the source port column, which likely correspond to ICMP type codes:  
- 3 = Destination Unreachable  
- 11 = Time Exceeded  

Neither of these are Echo Requests (type 8), so this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP types suggest network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (163.45.185.43 and 203.145.55.236) for unusual volume or frequency of ICMP error messages, which could indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If high volumes of ICMP type 3 or 11 persist, consider network path or configuration troubleshooting.

Heuristic and taxonomy are not applicable here due to lack of matching anomaly or attack pattern.
