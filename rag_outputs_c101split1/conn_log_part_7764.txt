Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP Echo Reply from 133.105.230.77 to 151.105.96.5, not a flood of Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is a single ICMP reply and not a flood, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks such as Smurf or ICMP flood.

No immediate security response is required, but monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs could be a prudent next step to detect potential future ping floods.
