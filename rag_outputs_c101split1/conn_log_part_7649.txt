Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network scanning or misconfiguration rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate why a single source IP (163.45.190.221) is sending multiple ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to diverse destinations in a short time frame. This could indicate network issues or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for increased volume or changes in ICMP types is recommended.
