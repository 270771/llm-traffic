Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 entry is from IP 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.7, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The other entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions, a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or more sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source(s).  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential slow or low-rate ping floods.  
- Review network baseline to identify unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
