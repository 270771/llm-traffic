Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP echo request (type 8) packets all targeting a single destination IP address (3.197.247.113) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013230.36). This pattern of many ICMP echo requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks).  
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attackers: Multiple source IPs in the 157.206.x.x range (e.g., 157.206.81.154, 157.206.18.108, 157.206.1.6, etc.)  
- Victim: Single destination IP 3.197.247.113  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (echo request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16).  
2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.  
4. Monitor the victim host (3.197.247.113) for service degradation and prepare to apply host-based firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP echo requests.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses and take appropriate remediation steps.
