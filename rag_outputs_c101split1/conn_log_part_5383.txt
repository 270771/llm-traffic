Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and the presence of only TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) suggest possible scanning or connection attempts rather than flooding. This could warrant investigation for port scanning or reconnaissance activity, which typically falls under heuristic classes related to network scanning or suspicious connection attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) for potential scanning behavior.  
- Enable or review ICMP logs to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with IDS/IPS alerts or other logs for signs of scanning or other attack types.
