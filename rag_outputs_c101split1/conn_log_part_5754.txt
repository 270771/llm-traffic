Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 85.151.94.241 to destination 203.78.172.181 with a single packet (count=1). This does not indicate flooding, which requires a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.  

Since no ping flood or other attack is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume from 85.151.94.241 could be a prudent next step to detect any escalation.
