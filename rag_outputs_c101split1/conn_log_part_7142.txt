Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet is logged, which is insufficient to indicate a flood or DoS attack pattern.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Request traffic characteristic of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or related ICMP error messages.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
