Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the type used by ping.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (mostly in the 157.206.x.x range) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP 3.39.157.141 in a very short time window (all timestamps are within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target simultaneously matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting a single destination.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Heuristic number (assigned): H-ICMP-FLOOD-01 (indicative label for ICMP flood detection).

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.2.254, 157.206.153.92, 157.206.0.148, 157.206.161.56, etc.
- Destination IP: 3.39.157.141
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.39.157.141.
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic temporarily to protect critical infrastructure.
6. Notify affected parties and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or outage.
