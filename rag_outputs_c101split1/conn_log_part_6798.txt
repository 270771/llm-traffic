Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013211). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range (e.g., 163.45.65.83, 163.45.254.197, 163.45.191.72, etc.)  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., traffic shaping, anomaly-based IDS rules).  
5. If the source is internal, isolate the host to prevent further network disruption.  
6. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic while allowing legitimate diagnostic use.
