Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 133.227.58.122 to 101.33.172.92 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Therefore, it does not match the ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows traffic from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.193 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but the count and packet sizes are minimal (0 packets, 0 bytes), indicating no flood or high volume.  

No anomalies or heuristics are triggered as no anomaly data is found, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if it begins sending large volumes of ICMP type 8 packets.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
