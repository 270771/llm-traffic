Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8 or not present at all, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and the presence of only TCP SYN packets with S0 state (connection attempts without response) suggest possible scanning or connection attempts rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for potential SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. This could be an early stage of an attack. Monitoring for repeated connection attempts from the same IPs or unusual port targeting is recommended. If scanning is confirmed, apply heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning (commonly heuristic #1 or #2 in many taxonomies).
