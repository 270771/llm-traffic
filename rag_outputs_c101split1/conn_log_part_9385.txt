Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there is ICMP Echo Reply traffic without corresponding Echo Requests, which could indicate misconfiguration or other network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
