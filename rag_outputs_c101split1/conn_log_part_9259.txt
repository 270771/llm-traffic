Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of ping flood attacks.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the ICMP type is 3, this traffic likely indicates network issues or scanning activity rather than a flooding attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there are misconfigurations or network reachability problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
