Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic may warrant further investigation to understand the purpose of the timestamp requests, but it does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from the involved IPs (130.187.20.251 and 167.46.181.17) to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
