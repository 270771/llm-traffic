Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (e.g., icmp.log) to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall or IDS alerts for ICMP-based anomalies.
