Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 174.95.41.114, from many different source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013221.4).
- ICMP type 8 is the echo request used in ping operations. A high volume of such requests from multiple sources to one target is a classic pattern of a ping flood (ICMP flood) attack.
- The presence of many distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP strongly indicates an attempt to overwhelm the target with ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #3: "High volume ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 174.95.41.114 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.137.137, 133.243.137.197, 133.243.137.143, 133.243.82.132, 133.243.82.151, 133.243.82.172, 133.243.111.77, 133.243.69.128, 133.243.154.170, 133.243.15.101, 133.243.26.170, 133.243.154.211, 133.243.128.59, 133.243.111.142, among others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 174.95.41.114.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests from multiple sources.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Notify the owner/operator of 174.95.41.114 to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate mitigation efforts.
- Consider engaging upstream providers or DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume increases.
