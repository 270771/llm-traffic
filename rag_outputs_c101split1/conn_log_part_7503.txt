Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). The second entry shows ICMP type 10, which is not type 8 either. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8) to overwhelm the target, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 packets and no other suspicious indicators, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate other types of ICMP traffic for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse, but no immediate action for ping flood is required. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue.
