Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with protocol number 11, which corresponds to ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior related to these IPs or ports. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the safest assumption is that this traffic is normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (68.54.158.130 and 17.33.254.36) and destination IP (203.78.143.78) for any unusual patterns or volume of ICMP type 11 messages, which could indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
