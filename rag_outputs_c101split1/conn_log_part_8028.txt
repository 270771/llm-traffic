Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 8, and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 packet from 157.206.116.186 to 107.102.62.64 and one from 202.64.149.241 to 163.45.65.130. However, these are isolated events, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 3 is a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- The traffic pattern does not match known ping flood characteristics such as sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity or anomalies.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: ICMP flood, taxonomy class: DoS/ DDoS).
