Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present, this cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristics or taxonomy context, the S0 state typically corresponds to incomplete TCP handshakes, often linked to reconnaissance or scanning activity.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential TCP SYN scanning.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning or other reconnaissance is occurring.
