Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 11, and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- ICMP type 3 = Destination Unreachable  
- ICMP type 11 = Time Exceeded  
- ICMP type 1 = Echo Reply  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations, especially since multiple ICMP types are present.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Consider enabling more detailed ICMP logging or IDS rules to detect other ICMP-based attacks such as smurf or ICMP tunneling.
