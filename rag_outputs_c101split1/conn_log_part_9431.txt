Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the ICMP type and connection state (OTH), this appears to be normal or benign ICMP traffic.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood, but monitoring ICMP traffic for unusual volume or repeated Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended as a next step.
