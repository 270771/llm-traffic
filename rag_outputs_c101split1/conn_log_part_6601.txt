Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks like Smurf or ICMP flood.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 172.23.68.231 or to the destination 203.78.247.166 in other logs to rule out a ping flood. Monitor for high ICMP request rates or unusual ICMP traffic volume.
