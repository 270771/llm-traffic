Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be identified by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the provided conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No entries indicate ICMP protocol or ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to confirm a ping flood.
- The traffic mostly consists of UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connection attempts with SYN flags, none matching ping flood characteristics.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood or ICMP traffic is present, no relevant heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The SYN packets with S0 state (SYN sent, no response) could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, which typically fall under reconnaissance heuristics (commonly heuristic #6 in many frameworks) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance/Scanning."

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as repeated failed UDP connections may indicate SIP scanning or malformed traffic.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable deeper packet inspection or IDS rules to detect malformed or suspicious SIP traffic and TCP scanning attempts.
