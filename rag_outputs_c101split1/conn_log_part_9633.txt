Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which is `0` here. For a ping flood, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request). Since the type is 0, this traffic does not represent an ICMP Echo Request and thus does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not specifically indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further to determine if it corresponds to other ICMP-based attacks or network issues. Specifically, verify the ICMP type and code fields in more detail and monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP traffic from the source IP 133.227.58.122 to 117.205.194.15.
