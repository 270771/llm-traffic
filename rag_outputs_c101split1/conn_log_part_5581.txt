Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (here shown as "0" in the destination port field), but the ICMP type is not explicitly "8" (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and code fields. Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or other unusual flags that might indicate a different type of ICMP-based attack or reconnaissance.
