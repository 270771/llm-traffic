Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. There is a single record with ICMP type 8, but it shows only 0 packets and 0 bytes transferred, indicating no actual echo request traffic. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of sustained ICMP Echo Request traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 sending ICMP type 8 packets with zero payload to confirm if this is a benign probe or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume from this or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
