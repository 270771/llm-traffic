Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 173.20.80.33 to two different destination IPs (163.45.129.193 and 163.45.129.212), each with a single connection record and low packet counts (30 packets each). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to overwhelm a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

The other ICMP entry with type 3 (Destination Unreachable) does not indicate a ping flood, as only ICMP type 8 is relevant for ping flood detection.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed traffic does not match typical denial-of-service patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from 173.20.80.33 or other sources. Investigate if these ICMP packets correlate with network performance degradation or alerts from other sensors.
