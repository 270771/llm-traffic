Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11, 11, and 3. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries correspond to ping flood traffic. ICMP type 11 is "Time Exceeded," and type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," which are not indicative of ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 and 3 messages often relate to network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are legitimate network control messages and not part of a reconnaissance or other attack pattern.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or abnormal ICMP packet rates that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
