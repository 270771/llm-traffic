Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged here, no ping flood traffic is detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack types. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically for ICMP type 8 packets to detect ping floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies. If scanning activity is suspected from the TCP SYN attempts, consider applying heuristics related to port scanning and monitor those IPs further.
