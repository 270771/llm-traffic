Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 3, 0, or other than 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries have type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP behavior, types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 0 (Echo Reply) do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages (e.g., 203.78.141.116 and 202.250.202.133) for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing excessive unreachable messages. Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies or different attack vectors.
