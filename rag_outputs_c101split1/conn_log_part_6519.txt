Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

No immediate security incident is indicated here. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential ping floods in the future.
