Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response rather than an attack initiation. No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet count is very low (1 packet), inconsistent with flood behavior.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (222.175.165.149) to the destination (133.105.148.252) to detect potential ping floods.
