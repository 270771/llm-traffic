Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (all in the 133.243.x.x range) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.227.90.79 within the same second (timestamp 1641013210.85xxxx). This pattern of many hosts simultaneously sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "high volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host," which is commonly classified under a Denial of Service (DoS) attack taxonomy.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 133.243.220.1, 133.243.101.133, 133.243.109.91, etc., all targeting destination IP 54.227.90.79 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at network perimeter devices to mitigate the flood.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (133.243.0.0/16) if they are not trusted or expected.
  3. Monitor the target host 54.227.90.79 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blackholing attack traffic if volume escalates.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts in a botnet.
