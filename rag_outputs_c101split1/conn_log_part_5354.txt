Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic, especially type 8, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to complement this analysis.
