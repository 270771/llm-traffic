Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries are absent; the conn.log snippet shows only UDP and TCP connections.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 targets port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), not ICMP type 8 (echo request).
- The ICMP type is not indicated, but since no ICMP protocol entries appear, no ping flood can be inferred.
- The traffic pattern shows multiple UDP connection attempts with S0 state (connection attempt but no response), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP echo requests) does not apply.
- The taxonomy class for ping flood would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP attacks, but no such evidence exists here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP attempts to port 5060 from 45.121.95.154 as potential SIP scanning or reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any ICMP echo request floods or abnormal ICMP traffic patterns.
- Collect and analyze ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ping flood activity.
