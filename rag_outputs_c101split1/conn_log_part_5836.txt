Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values are 3, 0, and 11, which correspond to Destination Unreachable (3), Echo Reply (0), and Time Exceeded (11), respectively. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, the observed ICMP types suggest normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes with type 8, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify under DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy.
