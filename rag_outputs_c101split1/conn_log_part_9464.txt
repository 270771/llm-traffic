Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single packet with no indication of flooding or high volume. There is no evidence of repeated or excessive ICMP Echo Requests from one source to a destination that would indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic typically relates to network diagnostics or routing issues, not attacks.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
