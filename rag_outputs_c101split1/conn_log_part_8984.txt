Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 1 and 10, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 1 corresponds to "ICMP destination unreachable," and type 10 corresponds to "ICMP router advertisement," neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (157.206.194.66 and 133.227.235.23) for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that might indicate other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
