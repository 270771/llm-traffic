Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 163.84.73.84, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013226.8). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 163.84.73.84 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.221.6, 133.243.31.9, 157.206.164.224, 157.206.194.227, 133.243.112.251, 157.206.164.252, 133.243.123.246, 133.243.71.2, 157.206.4.59, 157.206.151.6, 157.206.143.29, 157.206.81.27, 157.206.114.22, 157.206.75.27, 157.206.21.10, 157.206.149.14, 133.243.251.252, 133.243.225.194, 133.243.87.245  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.  
3. Monitor the victim host (163.84.73.84) for performance degradation and potential collateral impacts.  
4. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update threat intelligence accordingly.
