Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be a single ICMP echo reply, which is normal in network communications.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 185.183.48.120 to the destination 133.251.124.29. If a surge of echo requests is observed, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
