Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and none are shown, no ping flood traffic is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or connection failures would fall under reconnaissance heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP packet rates. If TCP connection failures persist, consider scanning detection heuristics.
