Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port, here showing "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP Echo Replies from 180.187.124.74 to 133.105.128.252 to ensure they are expected responses and not part of a reflection or amplification attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal traffic volume.
