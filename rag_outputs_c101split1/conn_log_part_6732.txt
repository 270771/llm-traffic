Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1 or 3, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries are type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

The observed ICMP types (1 = Destination Unreachable, 3 = Source Quench or other control messages) suggest normal or other diagnostic ICMP traffic rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP packets and no anomalies, no immediate attack is indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood or ICMP-based DoS attacks.
