Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single event with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious activity.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages are part of legitimate network diagnostics or indicate routing issues.
