Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than a flood of ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no immediate security response is necessary. However, monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (130.187.24.190) to the destination (44.202.250.29) would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
