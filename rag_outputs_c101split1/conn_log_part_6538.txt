Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have a type field value of 0 and 11 respectively (the 4th field after source IP is the ICMP type). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not represent ping requests and therefore do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, which are normal control messages, and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" (though here it is 0 and 11, not 8).

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP error messages, as excessive ICMP error traffic can indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts. Specifically, monitor 202.125.201.18 and 133.227.58.122 for repeated ICMP error messages and correlate with other logs to rule out other attack types.
