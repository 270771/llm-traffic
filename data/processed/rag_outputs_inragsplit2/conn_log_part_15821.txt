Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The majority of ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.
- However, there are only 9 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP (52.236.221.123), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- Other ICMP types (1 and 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.
- The traffic pattern does not show overwhelming volume or repetition from a single source IP, which is typical in ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if counts exceed 10 from multiple sources targeting the same destination.
- Investigate the destination IP 52.236.221.123 for any unusual service disruptions or alerts.
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to correlate with potential emerging threats.
