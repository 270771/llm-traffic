Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 54.186.100.117, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.186.100.117 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor the target host for service degradation and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from these sources. Conduct further network forensics to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
