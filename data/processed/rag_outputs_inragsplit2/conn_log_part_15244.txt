Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8, 64, and missing ("-"). Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).
- There are only two instances with ICMP type 8 (first and third entries), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The second entry with ICMP type 64 is not relevant to ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity if volume increases.
