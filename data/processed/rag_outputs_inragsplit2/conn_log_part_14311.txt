Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided log, only two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source type (3.89.103.26 → 203.78.186.205 and 61.1.51.193 → 18.36.162.241). The first entry has ICMP type 8 as the destination type, which does not qualify as a ping request.  
- There are only two instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly sources to identify if these IPs have suspicious behavior elsewhere.  
- Investigate the source IPs (3.89.103.26 and 61.1.51.193) for any unusual activity patterns.
