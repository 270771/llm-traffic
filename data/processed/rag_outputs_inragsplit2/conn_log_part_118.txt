Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 52.17.245.190 to 203.65.103.15, and there is only one such instance in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 11 or missing type fields, which do not correspond to ping requests (type 8).  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets may be normal network behavior or traceroute activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the IP 52.17.245.190 is repeatedly sending ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm or rule out ping flood activity.
