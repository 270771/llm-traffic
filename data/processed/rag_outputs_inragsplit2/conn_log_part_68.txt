Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs, consistent with a ping flood pattern. ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the volume here meets the threshold.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 104.78.121.140, 63.22.23.190, 23.177.32.0, 2.214.254.7, 23.213.92.3, 23.253.136.253, 23.253.155.250, 23.249.244.4, 104.96.225.251, 173.40.221.3, 23.93.236.3, 23.64.11.3, 95.100.167.251). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host at 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Implement network-wide ICMP rate limiting to mitigate impact from similar attacks.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and classified under the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
