Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets may be related to traceroute or routing issues, which are normal network behaviors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send unusual ICMP traffic or if other anomalies appear.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
