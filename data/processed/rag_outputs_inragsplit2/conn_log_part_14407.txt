Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- All entries are either UDP or TCP, with no ICMP type 8 packets present.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack), which corresponds to TCP SYN floods, not ICMP ping floods.  
- The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), consistent with scanning or SYN flood attempts, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 likely refers to partial or temporary anomalies related to TCP port scanning or SYN flood attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules to ensure SYN flood protections are active and tuned.

No evidence supports a ping flood attack at this time.
