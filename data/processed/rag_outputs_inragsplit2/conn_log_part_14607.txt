Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 13 is a legitimate timestamp request, not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
