Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances cannot be met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The connections appear to be normal TCP/UDP attempts with no signs of flooding or scanning anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging and anomaly detection rules.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics related to known anomalous IPs if such context becomes available.
