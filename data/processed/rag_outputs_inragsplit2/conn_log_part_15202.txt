Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are mostly not 8 (echo request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (second line: src IP 203.78.177.156 to dst IP 122.247.233.57).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 3, 11) are present, which indicate different ICMP message types (echo reply, destination unreachable, time exceeded), not ping flood.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of various ICMP types suggests normal network diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP within a short time window.  
- Investigate any IPs that repeatedly send ICMP type 8 packets if anomaly data becomes available.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
