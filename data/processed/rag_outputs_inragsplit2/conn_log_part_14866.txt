Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 8, 8, and 3. While two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), there are only 2 instances, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The third entry has ICMP type 3, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) could be normal network behavior or misconfiguration but does not alone indicate an attack.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the threshold of 10 or more ICMP Echo Requests is met.  
- Investigate the source IPs 163.171.168.73 and 139.179.133.57 if they continue to send ICMP Echo Requests at high rates.
