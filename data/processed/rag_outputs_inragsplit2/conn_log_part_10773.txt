Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have a type field of 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 required instances for a ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious IPs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets (type 0 is Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of a different reconnaissance or reflection attack.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated patterns from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
