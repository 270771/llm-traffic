Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source.
- The involved IP address is 163.171.168.73 (source), targeting multiple destination IPs such as 163.252.150.214, 163.252.233.4, 203.78.191.195, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or similar IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 163.171.168.73 to determine if it is compromised or being used as a bot.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
