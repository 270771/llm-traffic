Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 52.158.11.176 to destination 163.252.70.57, with a single instance logged. This does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomalies or heuristic matches are present in the anomaly CSV.  
- Without heuristic context or multiple ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.
