Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.25.198, 163.252.67.98, 163.252.1.199, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
5. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
