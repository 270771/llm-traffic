Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), so this traffic could be ping-related.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  
- The connections show OTH (other) state with no retransmissions or unusual flags, indicating normal or low-volume ICMP traffic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs have been flagged elsewhere.  
- Collect more extended conn.log data to verify if a pattern of flooding emerges.
