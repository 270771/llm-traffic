Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from a single source IP, 54.253.199.134, targeting numerous destination IPs within the 133.102.x.x subnet. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time window (~1.75 seconds), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records are found, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from one source to multiple destinations) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Source IP 54.253.199.134; Destination IPs include 133.102.68.2, 133.102.68.60, 133.102.67.250, 133.102.67.251, 133.102.73.242, 133.102.76.60, 133.102.66.249, 133.102.73.199, 133.102.73.254, 133.102.72.62, 133.102.76.62, 133.102.66.251. ICMP protocol, no ports involved (ICMP is portless).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from 54.253.199.134 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS and enable logging for forensic analysis.
  5. If the source is internal, isolate the host until remediation is complete. If external, coordinate with upstream providers or block at border routers.
