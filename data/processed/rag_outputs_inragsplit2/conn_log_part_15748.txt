Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 and 999, related to SYN attacks and other anomalies, but none indicate heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood), which matches some anomalies here (e.g., source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080), but this is not a ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential TCP SYN flooding or scanning activity.  
- Verify if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as absence here does not guarantee no ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
