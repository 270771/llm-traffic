Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include multiple addresses such as 163.252.246.230, 203.78.164.13, 163.252.234.248, and others. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but are logged as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related sources.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
