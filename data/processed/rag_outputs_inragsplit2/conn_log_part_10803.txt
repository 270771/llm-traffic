Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.158.92, 133.247.142.68, 133.247.23.15, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.183.65.24 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.183.65.24.
  2. Investigate and potentially block the source IP range 133.247.0.0/16 if these hosts are not authorized to send ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
