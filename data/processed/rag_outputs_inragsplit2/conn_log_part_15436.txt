Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the IP 54.184.243.206, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniform ICMP type.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 130.197.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.184.243.206 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the target IP 54.184.243.206 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack.
  5. Prepare incident response to mitigate impact and collect forensic data for attribution.
