Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) typically relate to network diagnostics or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.228.62.234 and 203.78.179.25) for unusual activity or repeated ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that might indicate emerging ping flood behavior.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
