Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.228.4.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (157.17.162.14, 157.17.164.44, 157.17.26.64, 157.17.162.27, 157.17.51.248, 157.17.232.175, 157.17.102.51, 157.17.104.200) targeting destination 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 54.228.4.24 for performance degradation and consider isolating it if service impact is severe.
- Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and block offending IPs network-wide.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
