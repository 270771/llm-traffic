Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is a single instance from 13.79.120.156 to 202.100.174.62.  
- There are no repeated ICMP type 8 packets reaching the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly matches, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 13.79.120.156 if ICMP traffic volume increases.
