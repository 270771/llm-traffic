Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these requests from multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.34.244, 133.247.184.92, 133.247.50.149, etc.) to a single destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated flooding attempt.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.0.0/16 range (e.g., 133.247.34.244, 133.247.184.92, 133.247.50.149, etc.)
- Destination IP: 157.187.159.183
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 157.187.159.183.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the identified source IPs if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare to isolate it from the network if the attack escalates.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall and IDS signatures accordingly.
