Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type is 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is warranted. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic from the IP 52.158.11.176 to 163.252.181.130 is recommended to detect any escalation.

No heuristics or taxonomy classes apply due to lack of anomaly data. Next steps: collect more data over time to identify potential volumetric ICMP anomalies.
