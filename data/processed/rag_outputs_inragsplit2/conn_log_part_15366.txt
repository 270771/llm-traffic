Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to heavy hitters (heuristic 999) and SYN attacks (heuristic 10).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies related to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (heavy hitter) for potential SYN flood or other DoS activities.  
- Verify if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as absence here does not guarantee no ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN flood attacks, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.  
- Heuristic 999 indicates heavy hitter anomalies, which may be high-volume or suspicious traffic but not specifically ping floods.
