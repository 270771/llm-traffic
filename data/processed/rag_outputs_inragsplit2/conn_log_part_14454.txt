Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries; all records are TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets or at least 10 such instances, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show failed TCP or UDP attempts (S0 or S0 with flags), which could be scanning or other reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods.
- Review network devices for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns.
