Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows 10 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement for a ping flood attack.
- The destination IP 3.115.224.159 is receiving multiple ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present in the snippet, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets applies.
- Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly reference these IPs or this traffic, the pattern fits a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which would typically be assigned a heuristic number related to ICMP flooding (commonly heuristic 20 or similar) and taxonomy class "DoS" (Denial of Service).
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (157.17.197.36, 157.17.106.193, 157.17.114.193, 157.17.72.248, 157.17.165.148, 157.17.114.195, 157.17.231.254, 157.17.189.212, 157.17.189.31, 157.17.96.125) targeting destination 3.115.224.159 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.115.224.159.
- Monitor the destination host for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential sources of ICMP flooding.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps, including blackholing or upstream filtering if the attack volume increases.
