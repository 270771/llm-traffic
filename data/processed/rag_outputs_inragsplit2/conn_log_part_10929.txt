Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to resource exhaustion via ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP: Source 3.80.126.221 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 3.80.126.221 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for collateral impact on destination hosts 203.78.178.88, 203.78.183.93, 203.78.189.230, and others in the log.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources exhibiting similar ICMP flood behavior.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
