Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related heuristics; the closest heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), none of which correspond to ping flood (heuristic 20).  
- The heuristic 20 specifically relates to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination, not observed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, as these may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are generating excessive SYN packets or other suspicious TCP flags, as indicated by the anomaly taxonomy 'ptmp' (partial TCP message) and heuristic 10 (SYN attack).

Conclusion: No ping flood attack is detected; the current anomalies point to possible SYN-based reconnaissance or attack attempts.
