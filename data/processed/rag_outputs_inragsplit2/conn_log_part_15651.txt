Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.71.218, 157.17.175.184, 157.17.8.40, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 35.169.51.96.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with source network administrators to mitigate the attack at the source.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
