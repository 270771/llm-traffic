Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 10, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 161.139.187.128 to 203.78.188.105). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 10 may warrant routine network troubleshooting or further investigation into network device behavior but does not indicate an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify any emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 161.139.187.128 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
