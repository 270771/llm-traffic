Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) to indicate flooding. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single OTH (other) connection with ICMP type 3. This type typically signals network diagnostics or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. Investigate if future logs show increased ICMP echo requests or known heuristic 20 anomalies.
