Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 3, 8, and 0. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641099666.021999), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.97.68 sending the single ICMP Echo Request if it is unusual in your environment.
