Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.134.27) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.54.210, 133.247.130.200, 133.247.1.193, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 34.25.134.27.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from untrusted or unexpected regions.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further mitigation.
