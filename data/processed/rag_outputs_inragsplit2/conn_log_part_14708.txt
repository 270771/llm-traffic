Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 13.86.188.134. This satisfies the condition of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood attacks: multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) flooding a single target.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.0.0/16 range targeting destination IP 13.86.188.134 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 13.86.188.134.
- Monitor the target host 13.86.188.134 for service degradation or outages and prepare to isolate it if necessary.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering or mitigation.
