Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The ICMP types present are 7, 5, and 0, which correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., type 0 is Echo Reply, type 5 is Redirect, type 7 is a less common code).
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP messages.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 5 (Redirect) messages, as they can sometimes indicate network misconfigurations or reconnaissance.
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics if available.
