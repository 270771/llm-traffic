Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 157.17.49.67 to 3.115.224.159, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), which does not count toward ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or related anomalies in network behavior.
