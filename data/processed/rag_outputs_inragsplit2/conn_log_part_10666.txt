Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs, primarily 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61. This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests is consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type is exclusively 8, which matches the requirement for ping flood detection.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, satisfying the threshold for identifying a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection based on ICMP Echo Request volume) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IPs 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting the affected destination IPs.
- Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the targeted hosts (34.44.165.118, 44.50.62.61).
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or outside trusted networks.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet, and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
