Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests flooding a target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.168.60, 133.228.167.252, 133.228.163.247, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target IP 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
