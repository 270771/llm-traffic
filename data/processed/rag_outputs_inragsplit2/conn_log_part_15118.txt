Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 1 and 13, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 required for a ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
