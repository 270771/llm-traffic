Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.249.10.152) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.10.152; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.249.10.152 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct further investigation on the source IP to determine if it is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs if possible, to coordinate defense.
