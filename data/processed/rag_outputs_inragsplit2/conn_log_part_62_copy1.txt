Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 163.76.120.97 to 163.21.32.70, and it appears only once.
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network scanning or routing issues but not a flooding attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for potential network misconfigurations or scanning behavior due to the high volume of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible future ping floods.
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify ICMP anomalies in future analyses.
