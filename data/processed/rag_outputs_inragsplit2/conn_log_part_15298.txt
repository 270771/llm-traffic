Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 6 and 4, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious ICMP traffic patterns.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
