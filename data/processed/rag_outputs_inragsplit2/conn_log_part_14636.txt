Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, these appear to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs have suspicious behavior elsewhere.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for heuristic 20 or other known indicators of ping flood attacks.
