Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.100.170.152 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the standard heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.100.170.152 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs including 163.252.103.166, 163.252.233.229, 163.252.233.75, 163.252.233.17, 163.252.103.130, 163.252.5.203, 163.252.48.1, 163.252.132.26, 163.252.103.210, and 163.252.132.10. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.100.170.152 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this and related IPs.
  3. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
  4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  5. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
