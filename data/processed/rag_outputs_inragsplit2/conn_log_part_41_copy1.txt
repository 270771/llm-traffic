Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.8.91.205 from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.113.51, 133.240.204.124, 133.240.202.20, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.8.91.205 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 69.8.91.205.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Monitor network and host performance for signs of service degradation or failure.
