Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources including 157.17.164.66, 157.17.107.31, 157.17.206.3, 157.17.99.240, 157.17.45.255, 157.17.213.139, 157.17.230.57, 157.17.165.139, 157.17.26.52, 157.17.102.23, 157.17.76.170 all targeting destination 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests (type 8).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 161.67.57.135.
- Notify network operations to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP ranges if they are known malicious or external.
- Conduct a forensic review of upstream logs to identify if these sources are part of a larger botnet or coordinated attack.
