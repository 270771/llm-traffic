Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets without known exceptions, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.48.230, 157.17.69.254, 157.17.142.50, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with ICMP flood detection capabilities.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
