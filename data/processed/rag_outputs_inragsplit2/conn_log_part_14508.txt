Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and other suspicious TCP traffic, not ICMP ping floods.

The heuristics found:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (taxonomy class 'ptmp').  
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to other suspicious traffic on unknown ports (taxonomy class 'mptmp' or 'heavy_hitter').

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further, as multiple TCP SYN connection attempts with S0 flags are present, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable or check ICMP logging to capture ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping flood attacks early.
