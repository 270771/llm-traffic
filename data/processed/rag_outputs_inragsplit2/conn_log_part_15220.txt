Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13, 1, and 10. None of these are type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the log snippet (in fact, none).  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP types correspond to:  
- Type 13: Timestamp request  
- Type 1: Destination unreachable  
- Type 10: Router solicitation  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual ICMP activity or other anomalies.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that might indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to confirm if any other attack patterns emerge.
