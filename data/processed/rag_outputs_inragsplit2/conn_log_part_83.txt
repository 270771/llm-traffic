Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97; Destination IPs include multiple hosts in the 163.21.x.x and 203.65.x.x ranges; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), port fields irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 163.76.120.97 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
