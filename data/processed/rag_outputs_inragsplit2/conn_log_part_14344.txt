Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic, which typically corresponds to heuristic number 20 in common taxonomies (ICMP flood detection).
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 13.242.241.56 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.252.189.194, 163.252.146.1, 163.252.180.140, and others.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automatically detect and respond to similar attacks in the future.
- Notify affected destination IP owners if within your administrative domain to prepare for potential service degradation.
