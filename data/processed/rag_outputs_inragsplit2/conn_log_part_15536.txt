Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests is 8, and the log shows three entries with ICMP type 8 targeting 43.202.248.60 from different source IPs (133.247.15.62, 133.247.54.18, 157.17.63.51).  
- However, there are only three instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP entry (type 0) is a reply and unrelated to flooding.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP requests are part of legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics for better detection.
