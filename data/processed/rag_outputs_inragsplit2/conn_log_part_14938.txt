Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 20 ICMP connections originating from source IP 163.171.168.73 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IP: 163.171.168.73 (attacker)
- Destination IPs: Multiple, including 203.78.176.189, 163.252.31.20, 163.252.245.240, 163.252.44.214, and others.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or blackholing on affected destination IPs.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
