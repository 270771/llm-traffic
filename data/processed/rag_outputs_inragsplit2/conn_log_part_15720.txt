Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single destination rapidly.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs are primarily in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.190.7, 133.228.82.122, 133.228.213.7, etc.), all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service impact and prepare mitigation plans such as blackholing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
