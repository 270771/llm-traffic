Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the provided conn.log entries is consistently `1` (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), not `8` (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero; thus, the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messages rather than a flood or DoS attempt.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 1 messages if they are unexpected or unusual in your environment, as frequent ICMP errors can indicate network issues or scanning activity.
