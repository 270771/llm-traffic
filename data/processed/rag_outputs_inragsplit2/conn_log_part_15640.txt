Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the flooding nature of the traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.244.103, 163.252.180.245, 163.252.15.217, 163.252.25.227, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 16.172.102.121 to identify compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source is external and persistent.
