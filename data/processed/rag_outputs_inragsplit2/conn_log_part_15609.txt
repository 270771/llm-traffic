Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 4 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types (4 = Source Quench, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not match typical flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies or heuristic matches.  
- Investigate the source IPs if unusual behavior persists, but no immediate threat is evident from this snippet.
