Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or traceroute-like activity but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 185.34.186.208 sending the single ICMP type 8 packet if it recurs frequently.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify patterns or anomalies over time.
