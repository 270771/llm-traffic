Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 1, 3, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies, no further investigation into ping floods is warranted.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes in future logs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 if it becomes available.
