Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or high-volume ICMP traffic is evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign or isolated.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.78.177.156 to the destination 213.55.14.198. If volume spikes or additional anomalies appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
