Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source").
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.221.141.21 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any are internal assets requiring additional protection.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other signs of DoS activity from this source.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or mitigating traffic from this attacker IP.
- Implement or review ICMP traffic policies to prevent similar volumetric attacks in the future.
