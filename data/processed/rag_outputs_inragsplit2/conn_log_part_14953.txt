Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 0 and 8, but there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) visible: from 183.116.77.65 to 203.78.188.201 and from 133.247.33.162 to 220.255.111.216. The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is well below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  
- The other ICMP types present (type 0) are echo replies, which are normal responses and do not indicate flooding.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs have been flagged elsewhere.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets coincide with network performance degradation or alerts from IDS/IPS systems.
