Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 143.224.65.254 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV identifies heuristic 20 as "Ping flood" and classifies related anomalies under "icmp_error," consistent with this detection.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily source 143.224.65.254 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs in the 163.210.95.x range. Another anomaly from 133.16.14.149 is noted but unrelated to this flood.
- The ports are ICMP (no ports), which is typical for ping floods.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 143.224.65.254 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor the affected destination IPs (163.210.95.194â€“163.210.95.215) for service degradation or outages.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on 143.224.65.254 to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch future occurrences early.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers if the source IP is external to contain the attack closer to the source.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error" as per the anomaly CSV and heuristic context.
