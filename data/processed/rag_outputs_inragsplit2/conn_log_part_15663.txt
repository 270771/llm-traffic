Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping floods based on ICMP type 8 traffic with at least 10 instances or known anomalous IPs, none of which appear here.

No other attack type matching the ping flood pattern is evident. The SYN attack heuristic (10) noted in the anomaly CSV relates to TCP SYN floods, not ICMP floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 further, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods in future captures.
