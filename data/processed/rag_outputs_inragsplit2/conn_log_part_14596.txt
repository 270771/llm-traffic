Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets, not ICMP.
- Therefore, the traffic matches a SYN attack pattern, not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential TCP SYN flooding or scanning.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible future ping floods.
- Confirm if any firewall or IDS rules are triggered by this SYN anomaly and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious IPs.

Heuristic and taxonomy summary:
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack — abnormal TCP SYN packets or suspicious ports.
- Heuristic 20: Ping flood — requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which are absent here.
