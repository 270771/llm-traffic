Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.7, and it appears only once.
- Other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not indicate ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
