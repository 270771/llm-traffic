Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the same destination IP 52.190.120.127 from multiple source IPs within the 133.16.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic signature of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.16.53.43, 133.16.207.8, 133.16.170.45, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 52.190.120.127. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.190.120.127.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to implement upstream filtering.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting a single victim IP, consistent with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
