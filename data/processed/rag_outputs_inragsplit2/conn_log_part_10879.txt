Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.42.116.124 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with echo requests to overwhelm them.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; Destination IPs include 163.252.127.1, 163.252.240.7, 163.252.239.58, 163.252.5.196, 163.252.212.34, 163.252.27.76, 163.252.231.65, 163.252.147.60, 163.252.10.245, 163.252.10.201, 163.252.236.71, 163.252.240.22, 163.252.7.213, 163.252.24.231, 163.252.247.181, 163.252.242.221.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and servers for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance caused by the flood.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP 52.42.116.124 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify affected network administrators of the targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential service impact.
