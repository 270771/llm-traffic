Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP traffic to 3.116.11.97 at the network perimeter.
  2. Block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential amplification.
  4. Notify network operations and consider upstream provider coordination to mitigate attack traffic.
  5. Review firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and prevent similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
