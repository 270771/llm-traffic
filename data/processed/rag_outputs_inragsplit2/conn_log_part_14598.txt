Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the log snippet are 11, 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 51.121.111.183 to 133.102.106.33), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are not indicative of ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may be normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 51.121.111.183 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to apply heuristics if available.
