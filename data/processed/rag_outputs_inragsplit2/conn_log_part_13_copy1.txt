Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.30.218.60, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack (ICMP type 8 only, with at least 10 instances).
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and the anomaly taxonomy code "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP, supporting the detection of an ICMP-based flooding attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the destination host 3.30.218.60 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
  5. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy NetworkScanICMP), requiring immediate mitigation to protect the targeted host and network infrastructure.
