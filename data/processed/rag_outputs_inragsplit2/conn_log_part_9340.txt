Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.254.250.38 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request Flood").
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38; Destination IPs include 163.252.38.250, 163.252.38.42, 163.252.43.129, 163.252.40.244, 163.252.40.254, 163.252.171.110, 163.252.38.248, 163.252.43.117, 163.252.40.114, 163.252.31.20, 163.252.31.72.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources exhibiting similar ICMP flood behavior.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
