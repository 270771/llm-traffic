Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) or type 0 (Echo Reply) is not indicated explicitly, but the ICMP type field is missing or not type 8 (Echo Request). Also, there is only one ICMP connection instance, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood heuristics.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request traffic volume from or to these IPs. Collect more connection logs to identify potential repeated ICMP type 8 packets. If multiple ICMP type 8 packets appear, re-evaluate for ping flood conditions.
