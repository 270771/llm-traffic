Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from source IP 52.237.221.62 to numerous destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the same source IP within a very short time frame, matching the threshold for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source 52.237.221.62; Destinations include multiple IPs in the 203.78.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 52.237.221.62 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack if it persists.
