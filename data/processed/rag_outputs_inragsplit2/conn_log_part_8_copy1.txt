Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP packets appear in the snippet.
- The anomaly CSV records show anomalies related to TCP ports 23 and 443 with heuristics 999 and 504, respectively, neither of which corresponds to heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- Heuristic 999 is uncategorized ("Other"), and 504 corresponds to HTTPS traffic anomalies, not ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:
- No ping flood detected; however, the anomaly involving source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 23 (heuristic 999) should be investigated further for potential suspicious TCP activity.
- Next steps: Analyze full packet captures or logs for ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Monitor the flagged IPs for other attack types, especially TCP-based attacks on port 23 (Telnet) and port 443 (HTTPS).

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 stands for Ping flood (ICMP Echo Request flood).
- The anomalies here do not match heuristic 20 or ICMP traffic patterns, confirming no ping flood.
