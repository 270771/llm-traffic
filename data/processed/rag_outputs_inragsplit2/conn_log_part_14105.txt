Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.166.249.180 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests; all relevant entries have type 8, confirming the traffic is ping-related.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.86.73, 133.247.86.80, 133.247.164.194, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.166.249.180 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent use of ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 54.166.249.180.
- Monitor the affected host and network for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
