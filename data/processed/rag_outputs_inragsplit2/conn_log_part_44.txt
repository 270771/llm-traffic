Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP echo request floods.
- The involved IP address is primarily 133.16.14.149 (source), targeting multiple destination IPs on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic and volume indicate a ping flood pattern.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this and related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to identify potential compromise or malware causing the flood.
4. Alert network operations and security teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attacks.
5. Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error."
