Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these requests from multiple source IPs (all in the 133.247.x.x range) to the same destination IP strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of ICMP-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.20.232 through 133.247.255.186 (at least 20 unique IPs)
- Destination IP: 35.183.65.24
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the destination host (35.183.65.24) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
- Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to filter or absorb ICMP flood traffic.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack source IPs for possible upstream filtering.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required for operations.
