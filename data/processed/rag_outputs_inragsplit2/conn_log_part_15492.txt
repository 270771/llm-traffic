Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 13.208.10.201 to 203.78.180.51, and there is only one instance.
- The other ICMP packet is type 13 (Timestamp), which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.
- Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Recommendation:
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request volume.
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern by reviewing additional logs.
- If heuristic 20 or other anomaly heuristics become available, cross-reference IPs for further analysis.
