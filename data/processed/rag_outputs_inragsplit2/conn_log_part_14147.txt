Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 3.231.100.178 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The source IP 161.67.42.226 is also sending multiple ICMP type 8 packets to various destination IPs, further indicating high-volume ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic rules for ping flood detection, the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination strongly indicates a ping flood attack.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 133.247.31.48, 133.247.23.143, 133.247.116.210, 133.247.105.156, 133.247.148.7, 133.247.31.190, 133.247.0.191, 133.247.87.163, 133.247.34.172, 133.247.105.207, 133.247.109.38, 133.247.109.39, 161.67.42.226
- Destination IP: 3.231.100.178 (primary target of the flood)
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and identify any additional source IPs.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily blacklisting the attacking IP addresses to mitigate impact.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact on network services.
