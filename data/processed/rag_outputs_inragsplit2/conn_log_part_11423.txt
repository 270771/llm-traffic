Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request). While several entries show ICMP type 8 from source IP 18.22.226.126 to multiple destinations, the total count of such ICMP type 8 connections is fewer than 10 (only 6 distinct entries with type 8 from that source).  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found).  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8 or are isolated single events, not indicative of flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The OTH (other) connection state and low counts suggest normal or benign ICMP traffic rather than a volumetric attack.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations at high frequency rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP or multiple sources targeting a single destination.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume and latency metrics to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged by heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
