Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets from a single source. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.67.118, 163.252.136.0, 163.252.82.193, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures to prevent recurrence.
