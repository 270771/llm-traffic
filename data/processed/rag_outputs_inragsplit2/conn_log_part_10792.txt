Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.179.180.7) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (based on the instruction referencing heuristic 20 for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (157.17.1.120 through 157.17.234.190) flooding destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.179.180.7.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Engage incident response to assess if this is part of a larger coordinated attack and prepare mitigation strategies such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
