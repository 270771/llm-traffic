Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 124.121.97.181 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.21.177.43, 163.21.3.196, 163.21.202.40, 163.21.252.33, 203.65.125.52, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts targeted by these ICMP requests.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider about the abusive IP for further action.
