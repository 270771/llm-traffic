Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network errors rather than flooding or DoS attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors that might indicate network issues or other attack vectors.
