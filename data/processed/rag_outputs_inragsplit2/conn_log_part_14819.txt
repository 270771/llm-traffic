Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Since ICMP type 11 is related to traceroute or TTL expiration, this traffic may be benign or related to network diagnostics. Without further data or anomalies, no attack is indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 traffic spikes abnormally, which could indicate other network issues.
