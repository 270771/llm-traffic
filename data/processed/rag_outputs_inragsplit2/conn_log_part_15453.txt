Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short time frame (all timestamps nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.58.68, 157.17.99.138, 157.17.98.125, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from these source IPs. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 16.161.126.169 and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Conduct further traffic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
