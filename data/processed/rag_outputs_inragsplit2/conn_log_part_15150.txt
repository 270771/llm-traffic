Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but fewer than 10 distinct instances are observed in the snippet (only 7 unique source IPs sending ICMP type 8 to the same destination IP 52.238.213.5).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to indicate known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- Other ICMP types (3 and 13) are present but these are not related to ping floods.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) messages may warrant routine network troubleshooting but do not suggest an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume from single or multiple sources.  
- Investigate the destination IP 52.238.213.5 for any unusual activity or service issues.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack emerges.
