Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.37.79.118, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- The source IPs are diverse (e.g., 133.247.110.177, 133.247.28.164, 133.247.110.20, etc.), indicating multiple hosts sending echo requests to a single target, consistent with a volumetric ICMP flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single destination) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IPs are:
  - Target: 34.37.79.118
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy network-based anomaly detection to monitor and alert on ICMP traffic spikes.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle ICMP traffic destined for 34.37.79.118.
- Conduct a forensic review of the target host to assess impact and ensure no compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation appliances or cloud-based DDoS protection services.
