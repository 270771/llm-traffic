Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (here clearly >10).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.175.200, 133.228.175.193, 133.228.162.1, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for service degradation and consider isolating it if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering or blackholing.
