Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP type values in the snippet are 3, 3, and 11 respectively, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- The ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood but could be related to network issues or other diagnostics.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another attack type. Without heuristic context or anomaly records, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors that might indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
