Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080 from a different IP, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood detection, is not triggered or referenced in the provided data.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP packets.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to confirm any ping flood activity.
