Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 35.127.18.10, from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP entries relevant to the suspected attack have type 8, satisfying the condition for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one IP) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs:  
  - Destination: 35.127.18.10 (target of the flood)  
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (e.g., 203.78.184.230, 163.252.9.234)  
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests directed at 35.127.18.10.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and prepare to escalate to blackholing or sinkholing if the attack persists.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and update incident response playbooks accordingly.
