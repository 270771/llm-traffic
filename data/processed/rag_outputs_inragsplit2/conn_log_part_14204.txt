Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 18.76.108.217 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is typically heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.76.108.217; Destination IPs include 133.102.67.249, 133.102.67.251, 133.102.68.130, 133.102.67.250, 133.102.66.254, 133.102.66.249, 133.102.66.245, 133.102.68.11, 133.102.68.12, 133.102.73.199, 133.102.72.47, 133.102.73.254, 133.102.76.62; ICMP port field is 0 as expected.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 18.76.108.217 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks in the future.
