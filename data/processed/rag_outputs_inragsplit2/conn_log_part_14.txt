Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 3.187.128.195 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood attack, and the anomaly taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding.
- Although the anomaly CSV record references a different source IP (133.16.14.149) for heuristic 20, the current traffic matches the same heuristic and taxonomy class due to the volume and ICMP type.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.78.x.x range (e.g., 157.78.65.215, 157.78.183.219, 157.78.41.183, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.187.128.195. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), port fields are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host 3.187.128.195 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary flows only.
  6. If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack traffic before it reaches the network.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and classified under the "icmp_error" anomaly taxonomy.
