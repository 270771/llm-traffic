Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or the logs. The only anomaly present is heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP traffic.  
- The anomaly taxonomy code 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 10 further, as it indicates a SYN attack pattern (high number of SYN packets or suspicious TCP flags).  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any network devices report ICMP anomalies outside of Zeek logs.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packet activity.  
- Taxonomy class "ptmp" in anomaly_782 relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood attempts.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on investigating the SYN attack anomaly.
