Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All conn.log entries are TCP or UDP; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related anomalies; the closest heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) and 12 (FIN attack), neither related to ICMP.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 12 indicates FIN attacks (TCP FIN flood).
- Heuristic 20 would indicate ping flood (ICMP Echo Request flood), but it is absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate TCP SYN flood or FIN flood activity further, as indicated by heuristics 10 and 12 in anomaly records.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood attacks.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
