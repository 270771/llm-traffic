Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.220.233.141) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ping flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; Destination IPs include 163.252.20.100, 163.252.215.96, 163.252.236.235, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any hosts are experiencing service degradation.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IP is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or null-route traffic from the offending IP if attack volume escalates.
