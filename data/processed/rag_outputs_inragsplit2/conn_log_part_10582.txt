Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from two source IPs (35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27) targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to many different destinations is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: ICMP type 8 traffic with at least 10 instances from the same source IPs.
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Sources: 35.183.65.24, 34.25.134.27
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in 163.252.0.0/16 range (e.g., 163.252.240.79, 163.252.64.89, 163.252.83.29, etc.)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IPs 35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
3. Conduct further investigation on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or external attackers.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch future events early.
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
