Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. The types present are 3 (Destination Unreachable), 13 (Timestamp), and other non-8 types.  
- There are no repeated instances of ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10 required) to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (3, 13) are normal control messages and do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests, especially if counts exceed threshold or match known heuristics.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy context to improve detection accuracy.
