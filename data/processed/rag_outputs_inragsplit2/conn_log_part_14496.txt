Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 8 is required for ping flood detection.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate if these ICMP control messages correlate with other network issues or scanning activity.
