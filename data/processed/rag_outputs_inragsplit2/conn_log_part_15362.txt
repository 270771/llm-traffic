Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 2 (ICMP type field is 2), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood heuristics.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple such packets appear, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
