Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- The ICMP type required for ping flood detection is type 8 (Echo Request), but no ICMP packets appear in the snippet.
- The anomaly CSV shows anomalies related to TCP port 23 and port 443 with heuristics 999 and 504, neither of which corresponds to heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- Heuristic 20 explicitly relates to ping flood attacks, which require ICMP type 8 traffic in sufficient volume (â‰¥10 instances) or matching known anomalous IPs.
- Here, no ICMP traffic or relevant heuristic 20 anomalies are present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The anomalies detected (heuristic 999 and 504) relate to "mptmp" classification, which is not defined as a ping flood or other specific attack in the heuristic context.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomalous TCP connections from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination port 23 (Telnet) as per anomaly_96, since port 23 is a well-known suspicious port and may indicate scanning or brute force attempts (heuristic 999 is uncategorized but suspicious).
- Review logs for any ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping flood.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
