Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- The source IP 3.231.100.178 is sending multiple ICMP type 8 packets to a wide range of destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet in rapid succession, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.231.100.178; Destination IPs include 163.252.232.219, 163.252.222.6, 163.252.83.138, 163.252.10.245, 163.252.83.166, 163.252.99.72, 163.252.38.248, 163.252.27.95, 163.252.104.17, 163.252.27.76, 163.252.35.24, 163.252.99.243, 163.252.201.201, 163.252.200.44, 163.252.201.248, 163.252.35.6, 163.252.151.201.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.231.100.178 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical infrastructure.
