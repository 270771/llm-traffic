Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous src/dst IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 122.218.143.152 (though the latter has ICMP type 8=8, but with different flags), all targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests to 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16) temporarily.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with upstream ISP for possible mitigation.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential escalation if service degradation occurs.
