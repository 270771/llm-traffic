Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). Only the entry with ICMP type 8 is relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 52.188.63.191 to 133.251.65.170), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11, which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or checking other logs for related anomalies.
