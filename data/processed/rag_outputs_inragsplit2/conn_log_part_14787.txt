Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances total, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known malicious actors or match heuristic 20 exceptions.  
- The connections are marked as OTH (other), indicating incomplete or unusual connection states, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without additional anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
