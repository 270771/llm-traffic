Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 157.17.73.211 to 52.237.221.62 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP echo request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
