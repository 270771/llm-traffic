Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within the same second). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with rapid ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 124.121.97.181 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.21.27.229, 163.21.212.36, 163.21.220.43, 133.250.64.44, 203.65.116.14, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood traffic.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts targeted by this traffic.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
  5. Notify upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and persistent.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, ICMP type, and source behavior.
