Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 128, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
