Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only one ICMP record with type 8 (echo request) is present: from 133.247.86.159 to 54.229.78.71.
- The total count of ICMP type 8 instances is 1, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types (0,1,3,11,13) are present but do not correspond to echo requests (type 8), so they do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of various ICMP types may be normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or match known heuristics once available.
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or volume spikes.
