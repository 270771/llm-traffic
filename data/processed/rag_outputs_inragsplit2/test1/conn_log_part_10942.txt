Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed primarily at the single destination IP 35.173.100.241, consistent with a ping flood pattern where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types in the snippet are type 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 traffic is considered for ping flood detection.
- The volume of ICMP echo requests (well above the threshold of 10) from multiple source IPs to the same destination IP strongly indicates a coordinated ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.49.34) targeting destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 35.173.100.241.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
- Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall rules accordingly.
