Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from standard ping flood detection heuristics) which flags multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single host.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.227.20, 157.17.225.7, 157.17.177.195, etc.)
- Destination IP: 52.236.221.123
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalies and prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if the attack volume increases.
- Notify affected stakeholders and update incident response documentation to include this event.
