Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP, 133.16.14.149, targeting multiple destination IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 2.212.31.251, 118.57.41.248, 104.126.15.251, 104.86.234.251, 23.230.181.255, 104.125.28.2, 184.167.163.255, 104.78.70.5, 184.207.29.251, 104.105.147.4, 104.110.37.247, 23.245.7.250, 23.71.172.252, and 23.213.239.3. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
