Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no repeated instances (â‰¥10) of ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source or to the same destination.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ICMP traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is evident. The connections appear to be normal TCP/UDP sessions with no signs of flooding or scanning.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP error messages.
- If suspicious activity is suspected, enable deeper packet inspection or IDS rules targeting ICMP floods.

No heuristic or taxonomy applies here due to lack of relevant data.
