Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123, originating from multiple different source IPs. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to a single target is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 133.228.116.130, 133.228.208.30, 133.228.208.10, 133.228.131.197, 133.228.171.200, 61.1.51.193, and others, all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other signs of coordinated attacks or compromised hosts acting as bots.
