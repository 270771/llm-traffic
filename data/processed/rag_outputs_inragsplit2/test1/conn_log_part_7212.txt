Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 50.239.214.145. This volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade or deny service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is **Heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood attacks.  
- The taxonomy class is **"Denial of Service (DoS)"**, as ping floods aim to exhaust network or host resources.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.21.230, 157.17.221.216, 157.17.96.241, etc.)  
- Destination IP: 50.239.214.145  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 50.239.214.145.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic if volume is large.  
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.  
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify the source of the attack and improve detection heuristics.
