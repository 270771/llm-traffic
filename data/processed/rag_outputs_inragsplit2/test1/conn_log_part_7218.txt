Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 50.239.214.145 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 157.17.14.73, 157.17.172.167, 157.17.172.181, etc.) flooding destination 50.239.214.145. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 50.239.214.145.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for broader attack context.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
