Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match the ping flood pattern.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, which is well below the threshold of 10 required instances for a ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations or routing loops.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
