Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests used in ping flood attacks.
- The destination IP 52.181.17.215 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.221.176, 133.228.172.59, 133.228.173.253, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 52.181.17.215.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 52.181.17.215 and prepare for potential mitigation such as blackholing or upstream filtering.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blocking or blacklisting persistent offenders.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
