Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the known heuristic that a ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs are involved (none are indicated here).
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (133.228.124.3, 133.228.78.57, 133.228.151.167, 133.228.124.86, 133.228.82.121, 133.228.124.2, 133.228.151.255, 133.228.82.118, 133.228.116.254, 133.228.116.245) targeting destination 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16) to the victim IP 3.83.92.175.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts participating in a coordinated attack.
- Alert the network operations team to monitor for further ICMP flood activity and consider blacklisting or isolating offending hosts.
- Review firewall and intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns proactively.
