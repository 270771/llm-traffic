Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one from 61.1.51.193, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 3.116.11.97. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts in the 133.247.x.x subnet.
