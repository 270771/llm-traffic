Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.34.27.210 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: ICMP type must be 8, and at least 10 such instances should be present unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved. Here, both conditions are met.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.23.119, 157.17.151.193, 157.17.96.189, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 18.34.27.210 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Most likely heuristic: 10 (ICMP Echo Request flood detected by volume and type).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host 18.34.27.210 for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if internal mitigation is insufficient.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate potentially compromised hosts within the 157.17.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
5. Enable alerting for abnormal ICMP traffic volumes to detect future ping flood attempts early.
