Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IPs (notably 3.20.63.105 and 69.8.91.205) within a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context means no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided. However, by standard detection logic, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 3.20.63.105 and 69.8.91.205. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic if it originates externally.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
