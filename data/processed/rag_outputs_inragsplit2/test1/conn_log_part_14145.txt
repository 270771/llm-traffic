Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- The source IP 161.67.42.226 is repeatedly sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range, consistent with a ping flood pattern where one attacker floods multiple targets or one target with many echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard heuristics for ping flood detection, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Source IP 161.67.42.226; Destination IPs include 203.78.170.80, 203.78.177.208, 203.78.182.101, 203.78.191.119, 203.78.171.216, 203.78.183.139, 203.78.178.169, 203.78.151.57, 203.78.182.107.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8 for echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 161.67.42.226 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or packet loss.
3. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
6. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
