Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.22.191.77, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x and 203.230.183.212 ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.22.191.77.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host 3.22.191.77 is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
