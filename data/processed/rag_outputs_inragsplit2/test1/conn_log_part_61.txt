Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating primarily from the IP 133.16.14.149 targeting many different destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), characterized by a high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the apparent attacker. Destination IPs include 104.86.71.169, 104.65.236.5, 96.210.188.20, 23.88.155.3, 23.210.111.252, 23.77.146.6, 23.217.94.5, 182.135.193.247, 184.167.2.1, 23.64.10.3, among others. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or other sources.
  3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
