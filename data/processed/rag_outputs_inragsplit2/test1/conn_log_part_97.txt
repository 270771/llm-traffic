Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP type values in the log snippet are either 3 or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
