Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 35.130.188.37 to destination 203.78.190.60, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.130.188.37 if the volume of ICMP Echo Requests increases significantly.  
- Collect more data and anomaly context to apply heuristics effectively.
