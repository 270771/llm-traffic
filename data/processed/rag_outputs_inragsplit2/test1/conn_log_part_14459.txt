Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks), characterized by multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one victim.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.38.2, 133.247.38.51, 133.247.39.41, etc.) flooding destination IP 157.187.159.183. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 157.187.159.183.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood (133.247.38.2, 133.247.38.51, etc.) at firewall or intrusion prevention systems.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
