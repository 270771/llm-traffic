Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (code 0) indicated by the destination port field "0" and protocol "icmp" with no explicit type 8 (echo request) present. Since the ICMP type is not 8 and there is only one instance, it does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack, which requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 anomalies.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, which are typically benign or related to traceroute operations.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or other anomalies is recommended to detect potential future attacks.
