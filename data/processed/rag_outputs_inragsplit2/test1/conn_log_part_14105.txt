Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.166.249.180, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and destination IP 54.166.249.180; ICMP protocol, no ports involved.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.166.249.180. Block or throttle offending source IPs. Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts in the 133.247.0.0/16 range.
