Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is:
  - ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request).
  - At least 10 instances of such packets targeting the same destination.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in 133.247.5.209 through 133.247.231.248 range.
  - Destination: 35.183.65.24
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (35.183.65.24) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with network teams to trace and contain the attack sources.
