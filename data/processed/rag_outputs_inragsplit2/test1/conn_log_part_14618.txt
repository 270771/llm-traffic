Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple different source IPs. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from various sources to a single destination, indicating a volumetric ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.226.201, 157.17.72.247, 157.17.238.95, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages and consider isolating it if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger distributed attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
