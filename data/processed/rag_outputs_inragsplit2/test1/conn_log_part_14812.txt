Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 as well (the field with value 0 in the 4th column for src port, which for ICMP is the type field), not type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are present to override this threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another attack type.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious ICMP behavior.
