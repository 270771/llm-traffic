Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 157.17.50.10 to destination 54.23.202.254, and it appears only once in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify suspicious ICMP behavior.
