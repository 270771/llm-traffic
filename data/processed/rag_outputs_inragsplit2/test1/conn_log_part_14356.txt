Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The majority of ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.
- However, the total count of ICMP type 8 instances targeting the same destination IP (3.127.149.71) is around 12, which meets the minimum threshold of 10 for potential ping flood detection.
- Despite this, the anomaly CSV contains no records indicating known suspicious source or destination IPs, and no heuristic context is provided to confirm this as an attack.
- The traffic volume and pattern do not show overwhelming or sustained flooding behavior; many entries have zero bytes or zero duration, indicating normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.
- No other attack types are clearly indicated by the data.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned confidently.

Next steps:
- Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window to detect any escalation.
- Investigate the source IPs sending repeated ICMP requests to 3.127.149.71 for any unusual behavior.
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic spikes to catch potential future ping floods.
