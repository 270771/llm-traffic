Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting two distinct destination IPs: 3.121.216.42 and 52.158.11.176.
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood or ICMP flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.

Involved IP addresses:
- Destination IPs: 3.121.216.42, 52.158.11.176
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet

Ports:
- ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting the affected destination IPs.
- Block or throttle traffic from suspicious source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network performance and logs for continued or escalating ICMP traffic.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic to affected IPs if the attack volume threatens network stability.
- Notify affected parties and coordinate with upstream providers for possible upstream filtering.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
