Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is a normal network response and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs with heuristic 20 if such context becomes available.
