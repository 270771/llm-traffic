Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.237.221.62 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source IP 52.237.221.62; Destination IPs include 203.78.180.42, 203.78.189.184, 203.78.181.138, 203.78.180.32, 203.78.178.220, 203.78.174.116, 203.78.180.22, 203.78.190.200, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.187.141, 203.78.173.230, 203.78.186.53, 203.78.174.82, 203.78.187.189, 203.78.187.181.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.237.221.62 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on routers.
- Review and update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect similar ICMP flood patterns.
