Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the provided conn.log snippet are 11 and 8. Only the second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping).  
- However, there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 is a Time Exceeded message, not related to ping flood attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. The low volume of ICMP echo requests and absence of repeated or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 133.247.116.201 or destination 47.251.187.120 appear in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- If more ICMP echo requests are observed, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using the 10-instance threshold and any heuristic context that may become available.
