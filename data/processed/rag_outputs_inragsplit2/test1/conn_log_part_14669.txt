Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from multiple source IPs targeting a single destination IP (52.237.221.62) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 163.252.9.189) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Monitor network and host performance for signs of service degradation or failure.
