Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same or related IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 0 packets are part of a different protocol behavior or benign network activity.
