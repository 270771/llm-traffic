Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 4, 1, 0, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be miscellaneous ICMP messages (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 4 = Source Quench, type 1 = Destination Unreachable), which are normal network control messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are any other logs or data sources showing repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types.  
- If heuristic context becomes available, correlate with known anomaly patterns for more precise detection.
