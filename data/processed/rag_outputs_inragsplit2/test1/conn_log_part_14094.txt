Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data were explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.193.126.151.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 54.193.126.151.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
