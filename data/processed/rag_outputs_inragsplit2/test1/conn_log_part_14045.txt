Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) targeting 68.104.133.69.
- Deploy network-level filtering or firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
- Consider engaging upstream ISP to filter or mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.
