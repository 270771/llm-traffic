Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8.
- The ICMP type 8 packets are consistent with ping requests, and the volume and distribution to many different destinations strongly indicate a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 104.97.89.248, 23.88.95.2, 23.235.49.250, 203.114.130.95, 23.238.67.255, 80.152.62.162, 23.79.4.7, 66.111.198.13, 104.93.165.254, 23.82.189.253, 193.37.174.168, 23.86.116.252, 23.68.51.4, 92.139.92.255, 204.171.80.32, and 23.90.237.252.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or other internal hosts.
- Conduct a network scan on 133.16.14.149 to identify if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host and potentially isolate it until remediation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
