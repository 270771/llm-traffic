Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but this pattern aligns with heuristic 20 (commonly associated with volumetric ICMP flood attacks) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and update firewall/IDS rules accordingly.
