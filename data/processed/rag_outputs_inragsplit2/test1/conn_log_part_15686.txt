Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Both ICMP types 3 and 11 are commonly associated with network diagnostics or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential stealthy or low-rate ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate ICMP error messages, as this could indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.
