Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), port 0 (ICMP does not use ports but Zeek logs show 0).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a full investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events early.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation or mitigation steps.
