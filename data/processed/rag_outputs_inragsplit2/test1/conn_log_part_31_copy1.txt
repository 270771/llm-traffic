Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.110.109, 133.240.65.44, 133.240.208.112, etc.) flooding the destination IP 54.239.183.175. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the target host 54.239.183.175 for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts to inform further remediation.
