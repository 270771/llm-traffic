Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP echo requests or at least 10 instances of such traffic, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP entries appear to be normal connection attempts or scans, but no specific heuristic or taxonomy for an attack is triggered here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to confirm absence of ICMP echo requests.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 if such context becomes available.
