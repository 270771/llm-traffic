Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.247.142.68, 133.247.49.41, 133.247.142.212, 133.247.142.70, 133.247.49.28, 133.247.95.236, 133.247.95.233) all targeting the same destination IP 35.169.51.96 with ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from multiple sources targeting a single destination.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily the source IPs listed above, targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP (port 0).
- Assign heuristic number 1 (common ICMP flood detection heuristic) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" as the most likely labels.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the destination host 35.169.51.96 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume increases.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation and coordinate with upstream providers if necessary.
