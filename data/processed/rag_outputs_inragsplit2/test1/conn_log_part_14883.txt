Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 128, which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential patterns or anomalies.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
