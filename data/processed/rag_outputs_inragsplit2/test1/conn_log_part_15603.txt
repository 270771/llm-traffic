Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of 3 or 11, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:
- Investigate if there are any other logs or data sources showing ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs.
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.
