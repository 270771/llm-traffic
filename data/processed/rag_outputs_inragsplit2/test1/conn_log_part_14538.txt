Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235) within a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records means no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the targeted hosts.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
  5. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
