Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts appear to be single connection attempts (S0 state) without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs that include ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood is occurring.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known anomaly indicators once heuristic context is available.
