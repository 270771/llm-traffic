Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically relate to network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs 203.230.183.212 and 157.17.160.34 for unusual behavior or repeated ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or volume spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
