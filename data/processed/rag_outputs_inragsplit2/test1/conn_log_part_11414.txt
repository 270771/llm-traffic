Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.76.138 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the situation aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" is appropriate here given the evidence.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; Destination IPs include 163.252.182.249, 163.252.24.224, 163.252.101.198, 163.252.24.211, 163.252.165.1, 163.252.187.72, 163.252.143.249, 163.252.187.253, 163.252.186.109, 163.252.143.181, 163.252.159.95, 163.252.186.86, 163.252.186.3, 163.252.159.94, 163.252.8.185, 163.252.8.175, 163.252.204.185, 163.252.100.254, 163.252.5.203.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted or involved.
6. Consider blacklisting the source IP if it is confirmed malicious and persistent.

This targeted and prompt response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood attack and reduce network disruption.
