Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 157.17.48.98 to 54.179.180.7, and it appears only once.
- All other ICMP entries are type 1 (Echo Reply) or type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping flood.
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 1 packets is normal network behavior related to error messages and replies.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source.
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.48.98 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to improve detection accuracy.
