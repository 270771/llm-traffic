Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of â‰¥10 ICMP type 8 packets unless overridden by known anomalous IPs (none found here). The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.114.198, 157.17.230.198, 157.17.179.167, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 52.236.221.123 on ICMP port 0.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Conduct a forensic review of the affected host and network devices to ensure no compromise or lateral movement.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
