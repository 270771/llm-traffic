Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry shows zero instances (count 0), and the other ICMP entry is type 11, which is not type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns over a longer time window.
