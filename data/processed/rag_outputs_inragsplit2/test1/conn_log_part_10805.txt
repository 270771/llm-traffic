Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target indicate a ping flood (heuristic 20 by default).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.118.251, 133.247.117.88, 133.247.180.78, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or outside trusted networks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
