Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request). While multiple entries have ICMP type 8, there are only 5 distinct entries with type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- There are no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 or any other heuristic since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided.  
- The presence of other ICMP types (3 and 0) indicates normal ICMP traffic such as Destination Unreachable (type 3) and Echo Reply (type 0), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to see if the threshold of 10 or more is reached.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious IPs or patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if their volume increases or if other suspicious behavior emerges.
