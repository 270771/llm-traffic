Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 11, 11, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are fewer than 10 instances of type 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another type of attack.  
- The observed ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) indicate other ICMP message types, not related to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.
