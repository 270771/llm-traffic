Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided in the snippet. However, the presence of only 1 and 0 instances of ICMP packets (fields near the end) and no repeated ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets indicate no flood.
- The first entry shows a single ICMP packet (count=1), and the second entry shows zero ICMP packets of type 8.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.
- The traffic does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.
- No other attack patterns are evident from the data.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply due to lack of anomaly data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request counts from these or other IPs.
- Enable logging of ICMP type fields explicitly to better detect ping floods.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets.
