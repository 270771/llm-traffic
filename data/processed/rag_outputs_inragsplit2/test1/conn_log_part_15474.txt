Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic context or anomaly records, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP error messages (type 3) for possible network misconfigurations or scanning activity.
