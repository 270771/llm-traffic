Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 210.122.60.24 to destination 69.47.68.48, and there is only one instance of this type.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 0 (Echo Reply) from 62.115.4.145 to 133.251.232.10, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, but no anomaly or heuristic data is present here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or correlating with other logs for suspicious activity.
