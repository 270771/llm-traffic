Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The connections target two main destination IPs: 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25, from multiple distinct source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but source IPs are multiple hosts in 133.247.0.0/16, and destination IPs are 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) targeting the victim IPs.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust filtering rules accordingly.
- Prepare incident response to investigate potential lateral movement or further exploitation attempts from the source IPs.
