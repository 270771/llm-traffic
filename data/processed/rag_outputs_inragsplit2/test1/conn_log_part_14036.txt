Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total only 4 distinct source IPs targeting 68.104.133.69, which is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to confirm a ping flood.  
- One ICMP entry with type 0 (Echo Reply) is present, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The traffic pattern does not show the volume or repetition typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with broader network logs to detect if these IPs appear in other suspicious contexts.  
- Obtain or develop heuristic context to better classify ICMP anomalies in future analyses.
