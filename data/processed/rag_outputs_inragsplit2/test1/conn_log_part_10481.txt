Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations within a short time frame.
- The involved IP address is the source 54.183.69.91 sending ICMP type 8 packets to various destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching or relaying this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or mitigating traffic from this source.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch recurrence early.
