Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 203.78.177.156 to 193.102.68.38 with a single instance (count = 1), which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry is type 13 (Timestamp Request), which does not qualify as a ping flood since only type 8 is relevant.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Recommendation:
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume.
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a legitimate network diagnostic or a benign event.
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based anomalies.
