Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.238.213.5) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (52.238.213.5) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
  4. Conduct a forensic review to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
