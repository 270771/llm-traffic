Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types are 8 except two entries with type 13 (Timestamp Request), which are not relevant to ping flood detection.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.161.126.169. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 16.161.126.169.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for broader attack context.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
