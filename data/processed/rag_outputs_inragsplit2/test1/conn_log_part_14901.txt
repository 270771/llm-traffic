Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the log snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.98 and from 13.74.134.236 to 202.194.32.93). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume of ICMP Echo Requests and absence of anomalies suggest normal or benign ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports.  
- If a sudden spike in ICMP Echo Requests occurs, re-evaluate for ping flood using the 10-instance threshold and heuristic 20 if applicable.
