Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from a single source IP, 52.42.116.124, targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet. There are at least 11 such instances, exceeding the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly from one source to many destinations, aiming to overwhelm the targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most relevant heuristic is heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs), which is not matched here, so the default heuristic for ping flood applies.
- Taxonomy class is ICMP Flood (a subclass of Denial of Service attacks).
- Involved IPs: Source IP 52.42.116.124; Destination IPs include 163.252.241.34, 163.252.204.185, 163.252.241.108, 163.252.234.147, 163.252.94.1, 163.252.159.24, 163.252.243.31, 163.252.100.254, 163.252.171.110, 163.252.159.94, 163.252.241.40. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IP ranges.
  4. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS/IPS rules.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
