Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 3.20.96.55 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a coordinated flood of ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches a classic ICMP ping flood pattern: multiple sources sending numerous ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination to overwhelm it.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (commonly used for volumetric ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.247.158.148, 133.247.185.88, 133.247.110.55, etc.)
- Destination IP: 3.20.96.55
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) targeting 3.20.96.55.
- Monitor the affected host (3.20.96.55) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Engage network operations to trace and contain the source IPs if they are internal or known to your organization.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems and enable alerting for similar future events.
- If possible, temporarily disable ICMP Echo Requests to the affected host until the attack subsides.
