Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs including 163.21.219.193, 163.21.38.43, 163.21.6.61, 203.65.118.82, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any are internal assets requiring additional protection.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a compromised host or botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle traffic if the attack volume escalates.
