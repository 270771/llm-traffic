Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for all entries with ICMP traffic is either 0, 3, or unspecified (0 or 3 in the 8th field), but none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the given data. The ICMP types 0 and 3 correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable messages, respectively, which are normal network operations or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 further, as it appears frequently sending ICMP packets, though not type 8.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
