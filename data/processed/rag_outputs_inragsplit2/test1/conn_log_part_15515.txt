Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy applies here due to lack of anomalies. Further investigation is not warranted based on this single entry, but monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source would be the next step if suspicious activity arises.
