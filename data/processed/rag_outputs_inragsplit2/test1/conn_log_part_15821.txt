Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total 9 instances targeting 52.236.221.123, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 3, type 11) are not relevant to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume from a single source or coordinated sources exceeding the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP.
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets for unusual behavior or reputation.
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
