Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV contains no records indicating suspicious IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping floods.
- Without ICMP traffic, the heuristic requiring at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 cannot be met.
- No heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood detection.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out by network devices.
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods, as many TCP connections show S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags, which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods in the future.
