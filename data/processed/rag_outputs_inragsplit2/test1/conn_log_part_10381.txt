Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.22.151.10) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume and distribution of source IPs indicate a coordinated flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 18.22.151.10 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the target host (18.22.151.10) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with network administrators to filter or mitigate the attack closer to the source.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
