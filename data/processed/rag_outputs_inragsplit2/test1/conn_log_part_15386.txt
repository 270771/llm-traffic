Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- There are no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomalies or suspicious IPs related to ICMP traffic are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances of such packets, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs specifically (icmp.log) to verify if ICMP echo requests are present.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated echo requests from single IPs.
- Enable anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to catch potential ping floods early.
