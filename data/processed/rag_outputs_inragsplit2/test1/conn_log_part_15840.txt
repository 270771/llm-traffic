Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.44.80, 157.17.235.180, 157.17.137.140, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of similar traffic.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation.
