Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.193.88.34) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.193.88.34; Destination IPs include 202.194.15.190, 202.194.17.37, 202.194.63.1, 202.194.63.2, 202.194.63.8, 202.194.17.63, 202.194.55.170, 202.194.13.55, 202.194.13.98, 202.194.48.54, 202.194.13.96, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.48.62, 202.194.15.188, 202.194.36.13.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.193.88.34 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify affected parties and consider blacklisting the source IP if malicious intent is confirmed.
