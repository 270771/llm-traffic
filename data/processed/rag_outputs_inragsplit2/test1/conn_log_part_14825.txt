Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.37.79.118) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 139.179.133.57. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources including 133.247.141.193, 133.247.189.57, 133.247.149.53, 133.247.161.198, 133.247.161.200, 133.247.50.168, 133.247.50.141, 133.247.161.20, 133.247.149.106, 133.247.111.5, 133.247.189.36, 133.247.83.198, 133.247.83.148, 133.247.82.168, 133.247.82.175, 133.247.117.52, 133.247.185.238, 133.247.117.17, 133.247.117.59, and 139.179.133.57 targeting 34.37.79.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (34.37.79.118) for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a network-wide review to identify any compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
