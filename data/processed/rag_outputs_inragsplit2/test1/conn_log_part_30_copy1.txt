Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175. This matches the classic ping flood pattern where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources to one destination). The taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.230.50, 133.240.230.152, 133.240.220.0, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.239.183.175.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network performance and logs for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
