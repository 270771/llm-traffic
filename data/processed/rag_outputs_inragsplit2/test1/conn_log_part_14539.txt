Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern involves multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges) sending ICMP type 8 packets to a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.118.117.235 and 157.187.159.183), consistent with a distributed ping flood targeting specific hosts.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources from 133.247.39.105, 133.247.185.29, 157.17.0.71, 157.17.24.61, among others, targeting destination IPs 3.118.117.235 and 157.187.159.183. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on perimeter firewalls or intrusion prevention systems to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and block additional malicious sources.
- Consider deploying anti-DDoS services or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
- Notify affected stakeholders and prepare incident response teams for potential escalation.
