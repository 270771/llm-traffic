Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.230.228.52, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these requests from multiple source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range) to a single destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 133.247.135.247, 133.247.80.11, 133.247.86.159, etc., all targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.230.228.52.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs.
- Engage incident response to assess impact on the target host and prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
