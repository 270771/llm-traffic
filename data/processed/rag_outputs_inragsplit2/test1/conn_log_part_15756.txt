Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) typically indicate network diagnostic or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data indicate suspicious activity related to these IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
