Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN flags and no successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to monitor for potential ping floods.
- Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to detect ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics once anomaly data is available to correlate suspicious IPs.

No ping flood or other confirmed attack is detected in the current data.
