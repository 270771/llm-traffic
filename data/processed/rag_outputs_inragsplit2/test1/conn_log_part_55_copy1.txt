Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are not indicative of ping floods but may relate to network issues or other diagnostics.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out ping flood. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Investigate the cause of the repeated ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or routing problems.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods promptly.
