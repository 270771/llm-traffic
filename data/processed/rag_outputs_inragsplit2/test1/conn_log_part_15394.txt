Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing issues.
