Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here. The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.14.4, 157.17.100.216, 157.17.167.129, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers for source mitigation.
  5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo responses on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
