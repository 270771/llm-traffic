Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious patterns or known malicious IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign activity.
