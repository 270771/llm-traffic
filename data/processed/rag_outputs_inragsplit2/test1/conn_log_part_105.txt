Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.158.38.252) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of source IPs (multiple 157.161.x.x addresses) sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting volumetric ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.161.5.136 through 157.161.241.169 range.
- Destination IP: 18.158.38.252
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the destination host (18.158.38.252) for resource exhaustion or service degradation.
- Deploy network-based anomaly detection to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack closer to the source if possible.
