Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 5th field after the source IP and port, which here corresponds to the number after the destination IP and port. The values are mostly `1` or `0`, not `8`. ICMP type 8 is Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 in the snippet, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 1 corresponds to Echo Reply, which is normal response traffic, not an attack. The presence of multiple ICMP type 1 packets from a single source IP (133.247.7.211) to multiple destinations could be normal or part of scanning, but without heuristic context or anomaly flags, this is not conclusive.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.7.211 for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or volume over a longer time window.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any emergence of ICMP type 8 packets or increased volume that might indicate a developing ping flood.
