Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not specified as 8 (echo request). Without at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, the traffic does not meet the threshold for a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection entry. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection termination but is insufficient alone to infer an attack.

Next steps:  
- Collect more connection logs to identify repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination.  
- Enable detailed ICMP type logging to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate if the source IP 133.247.129.247 or destination IP 207.180.220.122 appear frequently in other suspicious contexts.
