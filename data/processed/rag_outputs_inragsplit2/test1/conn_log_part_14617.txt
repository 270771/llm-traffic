Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed or multi-source flood rather than a single host.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x and 133.251.x.x ranges; destination IP 161.67.57.135; ICMP type 8; no ports involved (ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests to 161.67.57.135 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Implement source IP filtering or blacklisting for the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other network logs to detect possible amplification or DDoS escalation.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if this is a recurring issue.
