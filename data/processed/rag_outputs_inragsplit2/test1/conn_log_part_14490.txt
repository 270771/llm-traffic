Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 128 and 129, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 8 is required for ping flood detection.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 128 and 129 correspond to ICMPv6 Echo Reply and Echo Request respectively, but the low count and lack of type 8 ICMPv4 traffic exclude a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if more ICMP traffic logs become available, especially focusing on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) counts.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from or to suspicious IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data are available.
