Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs (all in the 133.247.x.x range) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 52.230.228.52 within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 52.230.228.52.
  3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
  5. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or botnet involvement and initiate incident response procedures.
