Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (proto field = 6), with no ICMP traffic recorded.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic matches indicating suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances of such packets, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to confirm absence of ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or anomalies related to source/destination IPs.
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP floods if not already active.
