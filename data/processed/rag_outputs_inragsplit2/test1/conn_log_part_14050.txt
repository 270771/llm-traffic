Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16) targeting 68.104.133.69.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
- Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
- Notify network operations to check for service impact on 68.104.133.69 and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic filtering or upstream provider assistance.
