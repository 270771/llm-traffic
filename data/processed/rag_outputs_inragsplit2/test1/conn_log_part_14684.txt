Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 3 message typically signals network or host unreachable conditions, which may warrant investigation into network connectivity issues but does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate network reachability problems suggested by ICMP type 3 messages if they persist.
