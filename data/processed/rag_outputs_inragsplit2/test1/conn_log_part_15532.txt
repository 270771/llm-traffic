Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 11, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may warrant routine network troubleshooting but does not indicate an attack per the given criteria.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 11 messages if network latency or routing issues are suspected.
