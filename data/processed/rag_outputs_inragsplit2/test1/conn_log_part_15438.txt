Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the specific type used in ping floods.
- All these ICMP Echo Requests are directed toward a single destination IP: 54.184.243.206, indicating a high volume of ping requests targeting one host.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records are found, but the pattern matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) targeting the same destination IP.
- Assign heuristic number 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely classification given the evidence.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Destination IP: 54.184.243.206 (target of the flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.247.81.244, 133.247.67.61, 133.247.149.106, etc.)
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.184.243.206.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic scrubbing or failover.
