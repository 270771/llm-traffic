Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) must be 8 to qualify as ping flood traffic.
- In the provided conn.log snippet, there are only a few entries with ICMP type 8, and they do not reach the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- The majority of ICMP traffic shown is type 11 (time exceeded) or type 0 (echo reply), which are not indicative of a ping flood.
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 0 traffic may be normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP to multiple destinations or repeated rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or patterns that deviate from baseline.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.
