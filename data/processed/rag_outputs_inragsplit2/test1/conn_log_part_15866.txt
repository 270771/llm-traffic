Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.228.4.24) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.23.52, 157.17.230.129, 157.17.158.51, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
