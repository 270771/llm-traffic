Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10 instances) and no such packets are present, this does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network behavior.

No immediate attack is detected. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
