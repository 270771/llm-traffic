Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present in the snippet (from 133.247.49.34 to 104.13.242.250).  
- The other ICMP entries are of types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
