Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.75 and 203.78.173.76). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present are 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which typically involves a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or correlating with other logs for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
