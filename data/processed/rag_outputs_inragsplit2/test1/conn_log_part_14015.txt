Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IPs (notably 34.25.86.31 and 35.173.100.241), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly records or heuristic context means we assign heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to suspicious src/dst IPs) as the most likely heuristic, and the taxonomy class is "Ping Flood" (ICMP Echo Request flood).
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges flooding destination IPs 34.25.86.31 and 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 and high volume of requests indicate a volumetric ICMP Echo Request flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16 and 133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs (34.25.86.31, 35.173.100.241) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy network-based anomaly detection to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders if mitigation at the firewall is insufficient.
- Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
