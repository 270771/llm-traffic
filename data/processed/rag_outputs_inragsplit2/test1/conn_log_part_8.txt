Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating primarily from IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number is **20** (commonly associated with volumetric ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is **"Denial of Service (DoS)"**.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 128.13.52.198, 104.79.58.1, 95.100.213.227, 104.77.150.5, 104.73.137.250, 23.234.253.251, 23.178.145.252, 2.214.249.255, 23.218.169.251, 104.65.224.3, 104.98.181.252, 92.139.236.7, and 69.35.216.3.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (echo request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
5. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
6. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the attack volume is large or persistent.
