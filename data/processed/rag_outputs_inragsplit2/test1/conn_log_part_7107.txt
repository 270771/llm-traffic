Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP type 8).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.71.178, 133.247.116.141, 133.247.116.142, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host (52.230.228.52) for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further mitigation.
