Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of source IPs (multiple different 157.17.x.x addresses) sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated flood rather than normal network behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) for ping floods, and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.0.0/16 range; destination IP 16.161.126.169; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet that are participating in the flood.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IPs if the attack persists.
