Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The provided conn.log entries show ICMP traffic but do not specify ICMP type 8. The first entry has 32 packets but no explicit ICMP type field; the second entry shows only 1 packet with no ICMP type 8 indication.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information from logs to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) exceeding threshold counts.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.
