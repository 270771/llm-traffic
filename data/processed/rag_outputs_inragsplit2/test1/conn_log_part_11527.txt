Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from multiple source IPs all targeting a single destination IP (34.25.134.27) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.51.199, 133.247.51.181, 133.247.74.146, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with affected parties to mitigate the distributed nature of the attack.
- Monitor the target host (34.25.134.27) for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential DoS impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or traffic shaping.
