Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
