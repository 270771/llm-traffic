Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 traffic (from 122.218.135.69 to 133.251.209.130), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages correlate with any network issues or traceroute activity.
