Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. Only one entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), and there is only a single instance of it. The other entry is ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and only one ICMP type 8 packet is observed.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious activity.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as port scans or DoS floods based on the limited data.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 133.247.49.34 or destination 23.197.225.60 appear repeatedly with ICMP echo requests.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify emerging patterns.
