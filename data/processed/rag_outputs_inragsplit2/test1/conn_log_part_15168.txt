Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13, 1, and 0. A ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is absent here.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and none at all in this snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 13 (Timestamp), 1 (Destination Unreachable), and 0 (Echo Reply) do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) packets are present, as they may indicate network issues or other benign diagnostics.  
- Collect more data to check for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or anomalies.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential threats.
