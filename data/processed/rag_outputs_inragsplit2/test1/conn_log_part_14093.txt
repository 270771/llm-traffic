Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 54.193.126.151. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (54.193.126.151) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and update firewall rules accordingly.
