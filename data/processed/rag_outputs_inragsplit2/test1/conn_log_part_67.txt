Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) from source IPs such as 133.16.14.149, 13.245.92.211, and 203.114.130.95 targeting various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so the most likely heuristic is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests indicating ping flood), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Sources: 133.16.14.149, 13.245.92.211, 203.114.130.95
  - Destinations: multiple, including 104.125.39.248, 163.210.231.251, 23.236.5.253, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests (type 8).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating traffic from these sources.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ping flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of affected hosts to ensure no compromise or lateral movement occurred during the attack.
