Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the IP 54.239.183.175 from multiple source IPs in the 210.148.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- ICMP type 8 is the Echo Request used in ping floods, and the volume and concentration of these requests on a single destination IP strongly indicate a flooding attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets to a single target indicate a ping flood (heuristic 20 by inference).
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from 210.148.124.221 through 210.148.127.225 targeting 54.239.183.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP protocol and type 8 confirm the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (210.148.124.0/22) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target IP 54.239.183.175 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle traffic from the attacking IP range if possible.
- Deploy or tune DDoS mitigation tools to absorb or deflect the ICMP flood.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
