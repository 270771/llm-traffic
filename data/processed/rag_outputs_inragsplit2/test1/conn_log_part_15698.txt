Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- Only one instance of each ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations or routing loops.
