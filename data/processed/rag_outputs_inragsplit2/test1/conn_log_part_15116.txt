Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before logging.
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for other anomalies in TCP/UDP traffic that might indicate different attack vectors.
