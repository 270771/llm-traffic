Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious activity.

No other attack type is evident from this single OTH (other) connection log entry with ICMP type 3. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns or anomalies.
