Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IP 54.179.180.7 from many different source IPs within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.113.11, 157.17.227.54, 157.17.21.24, 157.17.250.46, 157.17.239.254, 157.17.250.196, 157.17.229.165, 157.17.73.142, 157.17.24.193, 157.17.24.226, 157.17.251.73, 157.17.24.70, 157.17.236.51, 157.17.67.227 targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if the attack volume escalates.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
