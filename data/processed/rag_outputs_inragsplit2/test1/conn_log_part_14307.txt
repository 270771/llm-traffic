Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values present are 3 and 8, but there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets.
- The only ICMP type 8 packets are single occurrences from 3.231.100.178 to 163.252.67.95 and from 23.249.64.80 to 133.102.171.146, which is insufficient to indicate a flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.
- The traffic does not show the volume or repetition typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo request rates or checking other logs for related anomalies.
