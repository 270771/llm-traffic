Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.54), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
