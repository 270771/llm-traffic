Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, the fundamental condition for detecting a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.  
- The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, many with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

No other specific attack type can be conclusively identified from this data alone. If further investigation is desired, focus should be on analyzing ICMP traffic logs for echo requests and monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Additionally, reviewing TCP SYN flood heuristics could be useful given the number of SYN attempts, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.
