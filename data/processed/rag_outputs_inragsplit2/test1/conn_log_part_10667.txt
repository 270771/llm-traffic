Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting primarily two destination IPs: 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61, with one to 3.116.11.97. The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of these ICMP echo requests from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with numerous ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (known for detecting volumetric ICMP floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of the attack.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IPs 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61, all using ICMP type 8 with no source or destination ports (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs (34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61) for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP echo responses on critical assets if business operations allow.
