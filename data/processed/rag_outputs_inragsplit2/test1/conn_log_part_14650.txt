Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm a single target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is triggered here: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination IP.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source IP 203.78.184.2 (which is ICMP type 3, not relevant here), all targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response if service degradation is observed.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the most aggressive source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 52.237.221.62.
