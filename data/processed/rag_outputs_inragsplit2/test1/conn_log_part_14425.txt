Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries; all records are TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic mostly shows single connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 1900, which may indicate UPnP scanning or other UDP activity but not a ping flood.

Since no ICMP echo requests or multiple repeated ICMP packets are observed, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 1900 (SSDP) from 80.142.66.223 to multiple destinations, as this could indicate scanning or amplification attempts (heuristic 17 often relates to UDP anomalies).
- Monitor for any future ICMP traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
- Collect and analyze ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ping floods.
