Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.89.92, 133.228.119.198, 133.228.9.238, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (based on the instruction referencing heuristic 20 for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service" (DoS) attack.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range 133.228.0.0/16.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 52.181.17.215.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
- If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or block the attack traffic before it reaches the network.
