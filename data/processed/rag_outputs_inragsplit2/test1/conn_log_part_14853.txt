Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only two ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instances are present (from 222.88.115.43 to 163.252.170.199 and from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.91).  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks.

No attack is detected. Further monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and source IP behavior is recommended to detect any escalation.
