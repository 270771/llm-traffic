Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 139.179.133.57 and 52.239.117.247). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 13, 11) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) messages suggests normal network diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if their volume rises or if other anomalies appear.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
