Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating predominantly from source IP 3.231.100.178 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where a single source floods multiple targets with echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.231.100.178; Destination IPs include 163.252.232.219, 163.252.222.6, 163.252.83.138, 163.252.10.245, 163.252.83.166, 163.252.99.72, 163.252.38.248, 163.252.27.95, 163.252.104.17, 163.252.27.76, 163.252.35.24, 163.252.99.243, 163.252.201.201, 163.252.200.44, 163.252.201.248, 163.252.35.6, 163.252.151.201.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.231.100.178 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to stop the attack closer to the source.
