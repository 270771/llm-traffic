Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are fewer than 10 instances per source IP, except for 133.247.49.34 which has 3 entries only, below the threshold of 10. The entry with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) does not indicate a ping flood. No known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override the count rule.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests beyond the threshold.
