Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 instances is not met, as none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP entries show mostly connection attempts with no successful handshakes or data transfer, which may be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 (if available) related to known anomalous IPs in ICMP traffic for more targeted detection.
