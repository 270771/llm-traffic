Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97; Destination IPs include 203.65.127.196, 163.21.151.229, 203.65.118.168, and many others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Investigate the source host 163.76.120.97 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
