Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly flags, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets if they persist or increase, as they may indicate network issues or reconnaissance but are not inherently attacks.
