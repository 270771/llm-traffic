Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.  
- ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data for deeper analysis.
