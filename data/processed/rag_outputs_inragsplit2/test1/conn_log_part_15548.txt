Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from source IP 143.52.88.224 to destination 133.102.114.28, and there is only 1 such instance, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 143.52.88.224 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.
