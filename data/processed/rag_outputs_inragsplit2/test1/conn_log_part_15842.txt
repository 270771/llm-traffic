Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123. This matches the known pattern of a ping flood where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs to one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 52.236.221.123; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for any signs of service degradation or denial of service on the target host.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to implement upstream filtering or blackholing.
