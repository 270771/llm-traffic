Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances (in fact, none), and no anomalous IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 are indicated.
- No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without ICMP traffic, especially type 8, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood characteristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP logging in Zeek or other network monitoring tools.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from or to suspicious IPs.
