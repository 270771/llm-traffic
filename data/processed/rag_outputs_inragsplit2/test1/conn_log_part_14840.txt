Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs have suspicious behavior elsewhere.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.
