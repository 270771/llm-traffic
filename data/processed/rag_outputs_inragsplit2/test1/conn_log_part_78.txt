Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.87.6 to multiple destination IPs within the 163.210.95.x subnet, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different hosts strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic, which can be assigned heuristic number 20 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source IP 129.43.87.6; Destination IPs 163.210.95.98 through 163.210.95.255 (multiple hosts).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 129.43.87.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
