Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ICMP traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is evident. The connections appear to be normal TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), possibly scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the TCP SYN attempts further for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze ICMP traffic for future detection.
- Apply heuristic 20 (if available) to any suspicious IPs once ICMP data is present.

No immediate ping flood mitigation is required based on this data.
