Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.237.185.15 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior matches a classic ICMP ping flood attack pattern, which typically falls under a Denial of Service (DoS) taxonomy. The most likely heuristic number to assign would be 20, which commonly relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.232.1, 157.17.75.164, 157.17.1.117, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.237.185.15.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet generating the flood traffic.
  3. Engage upstream providers or internal network teams to block or mitigate the attack closer to the source.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
