Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 or 0, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 and 0 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Echo Reply respectively, which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate if there are other logs or data sources showing ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs.
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, cross-reference IPs for known anomalies.
