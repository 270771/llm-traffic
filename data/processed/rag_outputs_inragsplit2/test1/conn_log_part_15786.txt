Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (echo request) are present, there are fewer than 10 instances in total. The key criterion for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears to be normal echo requests without signs of flooding or other anomalies.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or the appearance of known suspicious IPs. Collect more data to confirm if a pattern emerges that meets the ping flood threshold or matches other heuristics.
