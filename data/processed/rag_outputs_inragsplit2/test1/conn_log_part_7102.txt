Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.230.228.52 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.230.228.52.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 52.230.228.52 and prepare for potential escalation.
  4. Conduct further investigation to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders if attack volume persists.
