Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the IP 54.206.231.130, the total count of such ICMP type 8 packets is 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, there are no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 or any other heuristics, as no anomaly data is found.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the same destination IP. Investigate the source IPs (157.17.110.62, 157.17.29.65, 157.17.249.53, 157.17.27.127, 157.17.27.205, 157.17.249.52, 157.17.101.33, 157.17.64.214) for any unusual behavior or correlation with other suspicious activity.
