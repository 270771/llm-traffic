Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The source IPs are numerous and mostly from the 133.247.x.x subnet, targeting two main destination IPs: 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25, indicating a distributed pattern typical of a ping flood.
- All entries have ICMP type 8, confirming these are ping requests, and no anomalies or exceptions (such as heuristic 20) are noted in the anomaly CSV.
- The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood, and the most likely heuristic number to assign is 1 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection).

**Involved IP addresses and ports:**
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.15.132 through 133.247.229.77 (various hosts in the 133.247.0.0/16 range)
- Destination IPs: 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs (54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to filter or absorb ICMP flood traffic.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify compromised hosts within the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet that may be participating in the attack and isolate them.
- Notify upstream providers and coordinate for traffic filtering if the attack volume escalates.
