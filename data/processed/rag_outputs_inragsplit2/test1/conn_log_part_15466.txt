Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only one ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is present in the snippet (from 133.247.28.164 to 54.217.146.45).
- The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.
- The connection states are OTH (other), indicating no established sessions or typical flood patterns.

No attack is present. No heuristic or taxonomy applies based on the given data.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or if heuristic 20 (if known) applies.
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.
