Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11; none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages (type 3 and 11) from source IP 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these logs for deeper analysis.
