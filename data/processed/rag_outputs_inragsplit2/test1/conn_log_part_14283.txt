Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 69.46.227.121 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so the heuristic and taxonomy must be assigned based on standard knowledge: heuristic 20 typically relates to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from 130.197.x.x subnet and others targeting 69.46.227.121 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall. Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Additionally, alert the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 130.197.x.x subnet. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
