Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (54.193.126.151) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious ICMP traffic.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic review to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts to inform further remediation.
