Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, only two entries show ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 161.74.252.59 and 18.167.118.9).  
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 uses other ICMP types (3 and 11), which are not echo requests and thus not ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 overall, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the data. The ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and 11 (time exceeded) messages may indicate network issues or scanning but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for potential network scanning or misconfiguration due to multiple ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect emerging ping flood attempts.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify ICMP anomalies in future analyses.
