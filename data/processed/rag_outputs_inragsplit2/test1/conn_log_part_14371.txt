Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection is from a different source IP in the 133.247.x.x range, indicating a distributed flood rather than a single host, increasing the attack's impact.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard ping flood detection heuristics:
  - ICMP type 8 is required (confirmed).
  - At least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 are present (confirmed).
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate given the volume and nature of the traffic.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.27.182 through 133.247.185.75 (at least 20 unique IPs).
- Destination IP: 157.187.159.183
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key identifier.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the destination host (157.187.159.183) for service degradation or outages.
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.
5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or tracing the attack traffic.
6. Consider deploying anomaly-based detection tools to alert on sudden ICMP traffic spikes in the future.
