Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.183.69.91 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential ICMP flood sources.
  4. Notify upstream providers or the source network owner to mitigate the attack at origin.
  5. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS for future rapid response.
