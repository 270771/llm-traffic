Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 128 and 8. ICMP type 128 corresponds to Echo Reply (IPv6), not Echo Request (type 8). Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic does not match the pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related logs.
