Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 14 distinct source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to the single destination IP 69.47.68.48 within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly records are present, so we assign heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection based on ICMP type and volume) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet targeting 69.47.68.48 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 69.47.68.48 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 if possible.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other network logs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
