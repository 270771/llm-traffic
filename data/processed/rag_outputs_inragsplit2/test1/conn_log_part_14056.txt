Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from various source IPs to one destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is **Heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood attacks.  
- The taxonomy class is **"Denial of Service (DoS)"**, as ping floods are a classic DoS attack vector.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.228.171.198, 133.228.221.176, 133.228.162.8, etc.)  
- Destination IP: 68.104.133.69  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none are applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor the target IP 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.  
4. Engage with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall and threat intelligence feeds accordingly.
