Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present here. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate security response is warranted.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show increased ICMP echo requests or anomalies related to these IPs.
