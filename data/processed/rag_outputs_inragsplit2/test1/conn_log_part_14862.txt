Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here due to the volume and type of ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.124.51, 163.252.231.217, 163.252.40.212, 203.78.180.228, and others.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS systems.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the attack persists.
