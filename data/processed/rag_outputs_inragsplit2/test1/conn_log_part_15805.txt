Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (inferred from the lack of explicit type 8 in the log; the Zeek conn.log snippet does not explicitly show ICMP type 8).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which is the required threshold to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP traffic with no clear flooding pattern or volume.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing full ICMP type details and volume over a longer time window.  
- Enable heuristic detection for ICMP type 8 floods and monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data once available to identify potential stealthy or low-rate attacks.
