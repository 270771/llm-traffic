Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not imply an attack.

No other attack type is evident from the data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign or incidental.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 183.127.88.66 to the destination 203.78.170.224. If counts rise above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
