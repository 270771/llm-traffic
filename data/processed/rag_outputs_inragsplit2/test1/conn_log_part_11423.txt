Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. The log shows multiple ICMP entries with type 8 from source IP 18.22.226.126 to various destination IPs, but the total count of these ICMP type 8 instances is fewer than 10 (only 6 distinct entries).  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 3, which are not ping requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) connection state and low counts suggest normal or benign ICMP activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 18.22.226.126 for unusual ICMP activity if volume increases.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
