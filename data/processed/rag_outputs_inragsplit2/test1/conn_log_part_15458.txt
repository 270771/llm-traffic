Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Monitor the target host 16.161.126.169 for service degradation and consider isolating it if performance is impacted.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
  5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs if the attack volume is large and persistent for coordinated mitigation.
