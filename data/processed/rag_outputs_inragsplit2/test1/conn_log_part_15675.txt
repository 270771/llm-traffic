Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, and no anomaly records or heuristics indicating suspicious behavior.

Since ICMP type 11 is related to traceroute or TTL expiration, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no other attack type can be confidently inferred.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets or anomalies involving these IPs could be a next step if suspicious activity arises.
