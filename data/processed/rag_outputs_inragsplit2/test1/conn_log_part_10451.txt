Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are Echo Requests, the hallmark of ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.104.200, 157.17.166.11, 157.17.28.205, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 44.61.16.153.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider engaging upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack if it persists.
