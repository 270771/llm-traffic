Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the single source IP 44.61.12.164 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which involves overwhelming targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.61.12.164; Destination IPs include 163.252.44.80, 163.252.146.203, 163.252.50.30, 163.252.181.247, 163.252.127.1, 163.252.47.171, 163.252.19.6, 163.252.19.4, 163.252.194.208, 163.252.255.182, 163.252.194.193, 163.252.255.184, 163.252.159.94, 163.252.35.201, 163.252.106.62, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.235.138, 163.252.236.72, 163.252.10.245.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 44.61.12.164 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or packet loss.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP 44.61.12.164 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP rate limiting and consider deploying anomaly-based detection systems to alert on similar volumetric ICMP floods.
- Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external to coordinate mitigation.
