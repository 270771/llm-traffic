Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies were explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, but the pattern fits heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 133.247.x.x) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP flood behavior.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood attempts.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the affected system owners and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
