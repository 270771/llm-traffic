Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one occurrence is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or other heuristics.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests (type 8) or additional suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match ping flood or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs, and collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential emerging anomalies. Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
