Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are more than 20 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.009 seconds), indicating high-frequency ICMP echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomaly records are found, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs including 163.21.223.32, 163.21.10.217, 203.65.126.49, and others.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, allowing only legitimate diagnostic use.
