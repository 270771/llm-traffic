Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The first entry shows ICMP with no type specified, and the second entry shows ICMP with a duration and byte count but no clear indication of ICMP type 8.
- The first record has only 1 packet, and the second has 58 packets, but without confirmation that these are ICMP type 8 packets, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.
- The traffic does not show the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood (which requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source).

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Investigate the ICMP type fields explicitly in the logs to confirm packet types.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IPs.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify suspicious behavior.
