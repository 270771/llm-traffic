Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are `3` and `1`, neither of which is `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These suggest network or routing issues rather than a flooding attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. However, the presence of ICMP unreachable messages may warrant investigation into network connectivity or misconfiguration issues.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs (157.17.58.249 → 156.26.38.216 and 203.78.179.82 → 167.190.169.210) for potential network reachability problems.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to apply heuristics and taxonomy once available.
