Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating primarily from IP 54.183.76.138 targeting numerous destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which matches the requirement for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so the heuristic and taxonomy must be inferred: this matches a classic ICMP ping flood (DoS) attack pattern, which typically falls under heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source IP 54.183.76.138 is the attacker; destination IPs include multiple hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this and related IPs.
- Notify network operations to investigate potential impact on targeted hosts.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS and enable alerting.
- If possible, engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic from the source IP.
