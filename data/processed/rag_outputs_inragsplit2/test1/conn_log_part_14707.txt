Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 13.86.188.134 from multiple source IPs within a short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 133.247.42.126, 133.247.19.126, 133.247.46.193, 133.247.179.195, 133.247.81.209, 133.247.118.1, 133.247.179.193, 133.247.163.208, 133.247.134.146, 133.247.135.223 all targeting 13.86.188.134 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target IP 13.86.188.134 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume increases.
