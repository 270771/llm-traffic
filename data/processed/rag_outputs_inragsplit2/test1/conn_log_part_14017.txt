Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.173.100.241. This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from various sources to a single target.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (e.g., 157.17.65.56, 203.78.181.175) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.173.100.241. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.173.100.241.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP flood behavior.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for possible coordinated DDoS activity.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying anti-DDoS mitigation services if available.
