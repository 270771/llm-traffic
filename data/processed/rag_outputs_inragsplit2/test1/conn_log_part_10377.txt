Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with ping requests.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or other anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they are unknown or unexpected in the network environment.
