Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3, 3, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the minimum threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
