Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099665.16). This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.30.111, 133.247.50.189, 133.247.180.5, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the destination host (157.187.159.183) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers if the attack volume is large to implement upstream filtering or null routing.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting 157.187.159.183, matching the standard heuristic of multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold.
