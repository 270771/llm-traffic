Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs targeting two destination IPs (44.50.62.61 and 34.44.165.118) strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" based on standard ICMP flood attack classifications.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 44.50.62.61 and 34.44.165.118. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Alert incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts following the DoS attack.
