Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only two ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instances are present (from 157.17.151.24 to 18.34.27.210 and from 157.17.23.57 to 18.34.27.210), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types other than 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP traffic with types other than 8 and low frequency suggests normal or benign network activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IP, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Investigate the two source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests (157.17.151.24 and 157.17.23.57) if they are unusual or unexpected in the network environment.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to apply heuristics if available.
