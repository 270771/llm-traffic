Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only 1 instance of type 8 is present. The other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 traffic may be normal or related to traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 61.170.183.124 or destination 163.252.43.94 show repeated ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential anomalies or heuristic matches.
