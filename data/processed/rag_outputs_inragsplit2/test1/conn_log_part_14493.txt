Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood or other specific attack heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs that include ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood activity.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies related to heuristic 20 if such context becomes available.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for other suspicious patterns, such as SYN floods or port scans, given the many S0 TCP states.
