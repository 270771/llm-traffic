Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP entries have type values 3 and 11, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectively, not Echo Requests.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed are normal control messages used in network diagnostics and error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information and volume metrics.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
