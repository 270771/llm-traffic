Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type that is not explicitly stated as type 8 (echo request), and only one instance is present (count=1), which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack patterns are evident from the single connection entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple such packets appear (â‰¥10), re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
