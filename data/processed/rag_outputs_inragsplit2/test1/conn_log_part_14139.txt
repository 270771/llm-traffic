Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets directed at the single destination IP 3.231.100.178 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.253.176, 133.247.163.213, 133.247.245.115, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.231.100.178. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 3.231.100.178 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
