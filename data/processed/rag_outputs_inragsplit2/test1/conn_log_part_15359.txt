Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 1 (ICMP type field in Zeek conn.log is the 7th field after IPs and ports; here it is "1"), which corresponds to "ICMP Destination Unreachable" or other control messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomaly data is available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.228.208.30, 133.228.210.13) and destination IPs (167.190.186.19, 167.190.171.239) for any other suspicious behavior in other logs.
