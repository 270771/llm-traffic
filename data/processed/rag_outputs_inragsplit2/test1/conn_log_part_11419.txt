Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating primarily from two source IPs: 18.22.226.126 and 54.183.76.138, targeting numerous destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time window (~0.01 seconds), consistent with a high-rate ICMP echo request flood.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from the same source(s) to multiple destinations.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Sources: 18.22.226.126, 54.183.76.138
  - Destinations: Various 163.252.x.x IPs
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter/firewall for ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs (18.22.226.126 and 54.183.76.138).
- Monitor for continued or escalating ICMP traffic from these sources.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact or follow-on attacks.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if available.
