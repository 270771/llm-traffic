Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) commonly used in anomaly taxonomies for DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in intrusion prevention systems.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
