Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows 84 packets with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one connection instance is present, below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Without heuristic context or anomaly matches, no further immediate action is warranted. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP in future logs is recommended to detect potential ping floods.
