Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.184.243.206) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here. The taxonomy class is consistent with a volumetric ICMP flood attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 54.184.243.206; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.184.243.206.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the destination host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
