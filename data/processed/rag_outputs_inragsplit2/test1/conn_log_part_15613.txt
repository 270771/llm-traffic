Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single entry from 133.247.182.144 to 188.41.60.58, which is insufficient to meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic context is available.
