Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate traceroute or TTL expiry activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific attack classification applies here.

No immediate security response is needed for ping flooding. Further investigation could focus on whether the ICMP type 11 messages are part of legitimate network diagnostics or indicative of network issues.
