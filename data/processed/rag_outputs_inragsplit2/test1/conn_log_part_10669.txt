Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `153.156.84.171` to `3.119.78.134` with a single instance.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets in total, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 1 or 3, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) packets may indicate normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP `153.156.84.171` if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
