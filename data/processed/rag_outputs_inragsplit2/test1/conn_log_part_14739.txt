Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.23.202.254 within a very short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records are found, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.23.202.254. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential botnet involvement.
  3. Notify network operations to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
