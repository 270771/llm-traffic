Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The ICMP type in all relevant entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping). However, the number of instances from any single source IP to a destination IP does not reach the threshold of at least 10 occurrences required to confirm a ping flood attack. For example, the source IP 15.130.145.131 sends multiple ICMP type 8 packets but fewer than 10 to any single destination IP. Other source IPs have even fewer packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack patterns (e.g., ICMP types other than 8 or other protocols) are evident in the snippet.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs. Correlate with network performance degradation or alerts from IDS/IPS systems. Investigate if any of these IPs have prior suspicious activity in other logs.
