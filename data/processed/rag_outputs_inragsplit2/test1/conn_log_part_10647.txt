Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All provided Zeek conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack can be confirmed.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to check for ICMP Echo Requests.
- Enable or review anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to identify potential ping floods.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics related to suspicious IPs if such context becomes available.
