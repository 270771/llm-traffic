Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward the same destination IP 54.228.4.24 within a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from different source IPs targeting a single destination strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (157.17.162.14, 157.17.164.44, 157.17.26.64, 157.17.162.27, 157.17.51.248, 157.17.232.175, 157.17.102.51, 157.17.104.200) targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.228.4.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the targeted host for service impact and apply host-based protections.
- Consider deploying anomaly-based detection rules to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests in the future.
