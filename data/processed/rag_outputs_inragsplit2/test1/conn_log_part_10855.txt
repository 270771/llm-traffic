Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the relevant entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 from the source IP 52.250.47.198 to different destination IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern appears to be isolated echo requests rather than a volumetric flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests from the same source IP or others.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 52.250.47.198 for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity, as multiple echo requests to different destinations may indicate probing behavior.
