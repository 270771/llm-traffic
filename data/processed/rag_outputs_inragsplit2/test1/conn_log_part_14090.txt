Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 54.193.126.151.
  3. Notify upstream providers or network owners of the source IP range to investigate potential compromised hosts.
  4. Monitor the target host for service degradation and consider temporary isolation if impact is severe.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
