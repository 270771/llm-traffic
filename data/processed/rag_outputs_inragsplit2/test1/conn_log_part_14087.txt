Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the instruction referencing known anomalous IPs and ping flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.51.195, 133.247.185.29, 133.247.51.184, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 54.193.126.151 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts participating in the attack.
