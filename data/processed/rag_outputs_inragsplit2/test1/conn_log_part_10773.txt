Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have a type field of 0 in the destination port column, but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request) in the given snippet. Without ICMP type 8, these are not ping requests.  
- Only two ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known malicious actors or match heuristic 20.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connection states are OTH (other), which often means incomplete or unusual connection states but do not alone indicate flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by extracting the actual ICMP type from packet payloads if possible.  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious activity.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
