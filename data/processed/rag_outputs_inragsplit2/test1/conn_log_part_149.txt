Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values of either 0, 3, or 11, but none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types observed (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as a high volume of ICMP error messages could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these logs for deeper analysis.
