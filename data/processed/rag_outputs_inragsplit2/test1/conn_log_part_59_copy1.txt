Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All provided Zeek conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious ICMP activity or known anomalous IPs related to ping floods.
- The traffic consists of multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts but not ICMP flooding.

Since no ICMP traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present. The observed TCP SYN attempts could be indicative of reconnaissance or scanning activity, which typically aligns with heuristic 1 (TCP SYN scan) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance," if heuristics were available.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts from IPs such as 167.249.133.167 and 107.81.9.228 for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to detect any other suspicious patterns.
