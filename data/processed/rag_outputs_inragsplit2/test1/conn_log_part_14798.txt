Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.28, and there is only one instance of it.  
- The other ICMP packets are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are present to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns over a longer time window.
