Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets sent in rapid succession from single source IPs (notably 143.224.94.6 and 133.16.14.149) to multiple destination IPs within a short time window. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: high volume of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming target hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs related to ping floods), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 143.224.94.6, 133.16.14.149
  - Destination IPs: 133.26.144.0 through 133.26.144.13, 23.179.46.5, 23.87.20.0, 23.70.184.2, 104.115.52.4, 23.189.108.5, among others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8 (echo request).

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs (143.224.94.6 and 133.16.14.149).
2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs to identify potential compromised hosts.
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic sources for possible upstream filtering.
4. Harden affected hosts by disabling ICMP echo replies if not required, or configure firewall rules to restrict ICMP traffic.
5. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised internal hosts or external attackers.
6. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
