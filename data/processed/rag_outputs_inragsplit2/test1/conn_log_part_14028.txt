Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.206.231.130 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) for ping floods, and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.109.203, 157.17.30.133, 157.17.0.71, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 54.206.231.130 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised or spoofed.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
- Deploy or update DoS mitigation tools and ensure incident response teams are alerted for potential escalation.
