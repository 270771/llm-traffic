Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.25.134.27 from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 157.17.x.x (though type 3 ICMP there is unrelated), all targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.25.134.27.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from multiple sources.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that are participating in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic if it originates externally.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to DDoS mitigation services if the attack persists.
