Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts overwhelm a target with echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (known from standard ICMP flood detection heuristics) which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one host.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range; destination IP 52.236.221.123; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123 at the perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Implement ingress filtering to prevent spoofed ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers for possible mitigation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.
