Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 11 (Time Exceeded), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and only one entry with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is the required minimum to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (none are found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The traffic appears to be a mix of ICMP error messages and occasional echo requests, which is typical network diagnostic or routing behavior, not flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly matches, no further immediate action is warranted. However, monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual source IP behavior is recommended as a next step.
