Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641099665.15xxxx). This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to the same destination IP is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP in rapid succession.  
- The taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Destination IP: 157.187.159.183 (target of the flood)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.247.129.182, 133.247.135.121, 133.247.30.190, 133.247.127.135, 133.247.74.213, 133.247.30.90, 133.247.185.24, 133.247.50.147, 133.247.96.62, 133.247.86.1, 133.247.30.83, 133.247.106.104, 133.247.15.166, 133.247.27.184, 133.247.96.67, 133.247.49.42, 133.247.38.22, 133.247.39.161, 133.247.57.196, 133.247.30.82.  
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 157.187.159.183.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures/rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service disruption and prepare for potential escalation.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools such as scrubbing services or DDoS protection appliances.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if source IPs are spoofed and update firewall rules accordingly.
