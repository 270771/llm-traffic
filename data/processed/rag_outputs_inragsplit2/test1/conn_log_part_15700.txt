Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (code 23), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No known heuristics or taxonomy apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns involving these IPs.
