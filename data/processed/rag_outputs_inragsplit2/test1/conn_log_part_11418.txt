Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from two source IPs: 54.183.76.138 and 18.22.226.126, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, the behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Attackers (sources): 54.183.76.138, 18.22.226.126
  - Targets (destinations): Multiple IPs in the 163.252.x.x subnet
- Ports are not applicable here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (54.183.76.138 and 18.22.226.126).
2. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
3. Notify network operations and affected parties to monitor for service degradation or outages.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking these source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are involved or affected.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
