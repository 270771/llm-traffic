Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting IPs 54.184.243.206 and 54.184.103.226, consistent with a ping flood pattern where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all relevant entries, satisfying the requirement for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.184.243.206 (primary target) and one to 54.184.103.226.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type and multiple sources confirm the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.184.243.206.
- Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the targeted IPs.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack volume escalates.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to legitimate sources only.
