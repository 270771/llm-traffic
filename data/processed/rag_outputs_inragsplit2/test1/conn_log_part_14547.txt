Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 151.21.243.24 to destination 202.100.174.62 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or related alerts.
