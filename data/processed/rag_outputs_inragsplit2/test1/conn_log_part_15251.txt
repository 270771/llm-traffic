Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3, 10, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided logs, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.
- The ICMP types seen (3 = Destination Unreachable, 10 = Router Advertisement, 0 = Echo Reply) do not indicate a ping flood or typical DoS pattern.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include:
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data if available.
- Verifying if any heuristic 20-related IPs appear in extended logs, as that could alter detection criteria.
