Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mixed values of 0 and 8, but the majority of entries with ICMP type 8 (echo request) are fewer than 10 instances. Specifically, only three entries have ICMP type 8 as the source type, and two as the destination type, which does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP echo requests from a single source to a single destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency or volume from any single IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs have been flagged elsewhere.  
- Investigate the sources 203.78.177.156, 130.197.157.16, and 130.197.190.209 if they repeatedly send ICMP traffic, as they may be benign but warrant observation.
