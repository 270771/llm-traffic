Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.127.34.186 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.127.34.186; Destination IPs include 163.252.174.57, 163.252.28.19, 163.252.158.33, 163.252.158.6, 163.252.90.249, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.127.34.186 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or similar sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential mitigation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch recurrence early.
