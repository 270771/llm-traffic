Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 34.25.86.31, within a very short time window. This pattern of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse source IPs to one target matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.179.246, 157.17.207.131, 157.17.68.47, 157.17.207.95, 157.17.9.52, and others, all targeting destination IP 34.25.86.31 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 34.25.86.31.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
