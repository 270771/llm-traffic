Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP, indicating a distributed ICMP Echo Request flood aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (distributed ICMP flood) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 35.169.51.96; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood activity.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 35.169.51.96.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to mitigate distributed sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and apply host-based mitigations such as ICMP rate limiting.
