Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence from 52.237.221.62 to 203.78.176.140.
- The other ICMP entry from 133.247.253.38 to 167.190.186.29 has ICMP type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating known suspicious IPs or behavior.
- No evidence of repeated or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests that characterize a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 matches if such data becomes available.
