Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the minimum 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP messages from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
