Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.230.228.52 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.41.66, 133.247.146.52, 133.247.179.195, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 52.230.228.52 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Monitor the target host 52.230.228.52 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or involvement in a botnet.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
