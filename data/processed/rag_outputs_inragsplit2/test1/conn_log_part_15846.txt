Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood detection. In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 111.94.75.187 and 178.162.156.67). The other entries have ICMP type 0 or other values.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in total, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and replies without volumetric flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or match known threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of flooding emerges over time.
