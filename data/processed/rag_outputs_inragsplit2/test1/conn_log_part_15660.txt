Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy applies here due to lack of anomalies. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to detect potential ping floods.
