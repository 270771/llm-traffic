Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types present are 1, 8, and 0. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There are only two entries with ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.
- The traffic does not show repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entry with ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and the third with type 0 (Echo Reply) appear isolated and do not form a pattern of attack.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated requests from the same source IP.
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with IPs in the logs for further analysis.
