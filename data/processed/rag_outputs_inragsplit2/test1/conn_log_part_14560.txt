Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are at least 7 distinct connections from source IP 54.9.51.14 to different destination IPs within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the presence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 163.252.67.98, 163.252.67.28, 163.252.79.221, 163.252.13.139, 163.252.245.241, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources of similar traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
