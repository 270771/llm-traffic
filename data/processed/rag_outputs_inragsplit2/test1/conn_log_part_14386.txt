Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 133.247.49.34 to 104.8.85.197, and it appears only once in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types is recommended to detect evolving threats.
