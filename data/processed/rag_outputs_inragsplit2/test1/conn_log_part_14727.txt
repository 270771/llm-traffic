Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.237.221.62 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "ICMP Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.237.221.62; Destination IPs include 203.78.178.94, 203.78.188.102, 203.78.188.94, 203.78.171.216, 203.78.182.243, 203.78.178.169, 203.78.182.101, 203.78.183.139, 203.78.185.196, 203.78.179.89, 203.78.186.195, 203.78.189.166, 203.78.191.232, 203.78.183.41.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.237.221.62 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and whitelist critical management IPs if needed.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Implement network-wide ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
