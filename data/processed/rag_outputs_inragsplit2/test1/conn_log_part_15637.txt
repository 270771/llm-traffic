Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify network operations and security teams to prepare for potential collateral impact on targeted destination IPs.
