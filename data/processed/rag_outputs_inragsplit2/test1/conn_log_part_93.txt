Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of either 3 or 11, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request (ping) packets.
- The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicates network diagnostic or error messages, not ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (in fact, zero), so the threshold for ping flood detection is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches exist to override the count requirement.

Since no ping flood is detected, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error and control messages.

Next steps:
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure no underlying network issues.
- Monitor for any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets that might indicate a developing ping flood attack.
