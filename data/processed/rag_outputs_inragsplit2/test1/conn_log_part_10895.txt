Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times from source IP 18.76.108.217 to different destination IPs (202.194.48.54, 202.194.48.62, 202.194.36.228). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the count requirement.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 18.76.108.217 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Verify if the ICMP traffic pattern changes to meet ping flood criteria or if other attack types emerge.
