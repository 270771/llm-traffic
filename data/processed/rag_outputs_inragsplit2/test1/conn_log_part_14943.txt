Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. Here, only two entries have ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry has type 3, which is not related to ping requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.
- The traffic pattern does not match typical ping flood behavior, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume.
- Investigate if the IP 139.179.133.57 repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests to multiple destinations, as this could be a precursor to a ping flood.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
