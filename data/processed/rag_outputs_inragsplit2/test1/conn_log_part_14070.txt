Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 34.33.149.154 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP without known exceptions. This matches the observed data.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x range and one from 202.124.53.30, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.33.149.154. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.33.149.154.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor the target host for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up forensic analysis.
