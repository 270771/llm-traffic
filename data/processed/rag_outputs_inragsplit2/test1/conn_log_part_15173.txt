Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward the single destination IP 34.44.165.118, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.136.127, 157.17.71.218, 157.17.101.2, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.44.165.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 34.44.165.118.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
