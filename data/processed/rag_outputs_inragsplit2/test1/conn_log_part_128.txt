Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances (specifically 22) of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the same source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: a single source rapidly sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the classic heuristic for ping flood detection involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one source to many destinations, fitting heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) by common taxonomy standards.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs including 203.65.115.102, 163.21.102.221, 163.21.0.21, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
