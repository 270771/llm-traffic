Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 35.130.188.37 to 203.78.186.54, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is well below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 packets may warrant investigation for possible traceroute or network issues but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual network behavior is observed.
