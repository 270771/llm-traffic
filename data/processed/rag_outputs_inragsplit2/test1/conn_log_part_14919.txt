Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 11, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP connections, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if any new anomaly records or heuristic context become available to reassess.
