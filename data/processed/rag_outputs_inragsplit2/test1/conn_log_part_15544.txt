Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 3, 8, 0, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (157.17.39.165 â†’ 16.161.126.169). The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 3, 11) correspond to Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, and Time Exceeded, which do not indicate ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other anomaly sources, but currently, no ping flood or related ICMP attack is detected.
