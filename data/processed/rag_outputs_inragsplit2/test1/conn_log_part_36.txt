Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) from multiple source IPs within the 133.7.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.7.0.0/16 range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the promptâ€™s mention), which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood attacks. The taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.7.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host (52.190.120.127) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
- Alert incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
