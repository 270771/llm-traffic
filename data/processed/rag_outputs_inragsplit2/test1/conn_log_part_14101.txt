Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple (over 10) ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the IP 54.166.249.180 from a wide range of source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.43.193, 133.247.145.209, 133.247.11.30, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.166.249.180 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.166.249.180.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or peers to filter malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source if possible.
