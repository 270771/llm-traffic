Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.186.116.19) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request flood detected").
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.186.116.19; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.186.116.19 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
3. Conduct a threat intelligence check on 54.186.116.19 to determine if it is a known malicious actor.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place to prevent recurrence.
