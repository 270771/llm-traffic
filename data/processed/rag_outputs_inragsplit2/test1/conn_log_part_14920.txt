Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.198, and there is only one instance of it.  
- The other ICMP packets are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not ping requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 packets may warrant routine network troubleshooting but do not indicate flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Collect more data to identify any emerging patterns or anomalies.
