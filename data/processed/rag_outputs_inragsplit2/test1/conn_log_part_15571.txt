Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for other types of anomalies or suspicious traffic patterns, especially in ICMP logs or other protocol logs not included here.  
- If TCP SYN floods or other DoS attacks are suspected, review SYN flags and connection states in more detail.

Heuristic and taxonomy references:  
- Heuristic 20 (if present) relates to known anomalous IPs involved in ping floods.  
- Taxonomy for ping flood attacks involves ICMP Echo Request floods (type 8).  
- Since no ICMP traffic is present, these do not apply here.
