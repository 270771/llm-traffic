Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP (3.20.63.105) from multiple source IPs within the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 157.161.224.128, 157.161.8.201, 157.161.84.182, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.20.63.105 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host (3.20.63.105) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking the malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet, and initiate remediation or blacklisting accordingly.
