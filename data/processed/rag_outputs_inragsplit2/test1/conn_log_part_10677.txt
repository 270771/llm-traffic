Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 1 (ICMP type field is 1), which is not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP or checking for other suspicious traffic patterns.
