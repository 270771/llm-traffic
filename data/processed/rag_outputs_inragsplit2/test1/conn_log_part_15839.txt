Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the echo request type required for ping floods.
- Although the count is just under 10, the rapid succession and multiple unique sources targeting the same destination strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are explicitly provided, but this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ICMP floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" by standard classification.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and identify if the source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to block or filter traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS mitigation capabilities to automatically detect and block such floods.
- Alert the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation or outage on the targeted host.
