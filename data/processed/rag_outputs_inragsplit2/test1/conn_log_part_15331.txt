Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 130.197.144.160 to 123.64.161.243, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Echo Reply), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly matches, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or related network performance degradation.
