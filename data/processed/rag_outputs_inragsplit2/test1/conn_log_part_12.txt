Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (129.43.86.1) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting suspicious ICMP flood patterns) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.86.1; Destination IPs range from 203.114.237.98 through 203.114.237.127.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 129.43.86.1 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any additional ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
