Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these packets are part of a known attack pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP type 3 packets typically indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any heuristic 20 or other heuristics become relevant once anomaly data is available.  
- Continue logging and analyzing ICMP traffic for volume and type patterns consistent with flooding or scanning.
