Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one instance with ICMP type 8 is present (source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.70).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is 1, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) could be normal network behavior or related to traceroute-like activity, which is not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
