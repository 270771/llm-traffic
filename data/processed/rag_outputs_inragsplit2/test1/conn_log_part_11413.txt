Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in IDS/IPS systems.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP for possible blackholing or further action.
