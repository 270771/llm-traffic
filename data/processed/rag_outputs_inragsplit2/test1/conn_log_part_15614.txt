Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 1 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomalies, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
