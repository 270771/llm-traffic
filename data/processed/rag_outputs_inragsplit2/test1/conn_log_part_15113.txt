Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly datasets.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out a potential ping flood if the volume of ICMP echo requests increases.
