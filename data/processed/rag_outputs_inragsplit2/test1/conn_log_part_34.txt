Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) from multiple source IPs within the 133.7.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.7.14.6, 133.7.39.252, 133.7.90.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.7.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 52.190.120.127.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider upstream provider coordination to block or mitigate traffic from these sources.
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary use cases only.
