Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood detection.
- The pattern of many sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to one destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this matches a classic ICMP flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.169.111, 133.228.205.210, 133.228.236.56, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 68.104.133.69.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for escalation or changes in attack vectors.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
