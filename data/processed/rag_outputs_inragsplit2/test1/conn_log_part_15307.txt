Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from a single source IP, 54.253.199.134, targeting multiple destination IPs within the 133.102.x.x subnet. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time frame (~1.75 seconds), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood attacks: repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations without legitimate session context.
- The involved IP addresses are source 54.253.199.134 and multiple destination IPs in the 133.102.66.2 to 133.102.79.183 range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from 54.253.199.134 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
