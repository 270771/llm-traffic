Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows 10 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the same destination IP 34.25.86.31 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (157.17.254.8, 157.17.254.17, 157.17.173.109, 157.17.173.126, 157.17.173.15, 157.17.229.62, 157.17.114.109, 157.17.254.3, 157.17.229.193, 157.17.229.4) targeting destination IP 34.25.86.31 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at network perimeter devices to mitigate the flood.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs temporarily.
  3. Monitor the target host 34.25.86.31 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate upstream network devices and logs for possible botnet or compromised hosts generating the flood.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
