Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.79.249 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.79.249 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs in the 133.141.197.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.16.14.149).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 129.43.79.249 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
- Notify affected parties and update incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
