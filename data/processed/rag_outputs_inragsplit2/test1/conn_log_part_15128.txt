Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8 (from the snippet: one entry with ICMP type 0, another with type 11). However, only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = echo reply, 11 = time exceeded) do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) may be normal network behavior or traceroute-like activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate if the source IPs (157.17.48.182, 133.228.208.8) have any prior history of suspicious activity.
