Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances total, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the count threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which typically involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristics or anomalies, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
