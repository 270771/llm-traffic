Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The connections target primarily two destination IPs: 52.158.11.176 and 3.121.216.42, indicating multiple sources are sending numerous ICMP echo requests to these targets.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources to a single destination) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Source IPs are diverse within the 157.17.x.x range, suggesting a distributed pattern typical of a ping flood.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting IPs 52.158.11.176 and 3.121.216.42.
- Block or throttle traffic from suspicious source IPs in the 157.17.x.x subnet that are sending excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases.
