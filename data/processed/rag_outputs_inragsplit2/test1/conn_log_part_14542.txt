Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only two entries with ICMP type 8 (lines 1 and 2), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) could be normal network behavior or traceroute activity, which is not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.170.237 and 157.17.49.222 if they repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
