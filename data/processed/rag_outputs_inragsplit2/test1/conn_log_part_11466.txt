Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these requests from many different source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.228.x.x range and some others (e.g., 202.202.x.x) targeting destination IP 52.181.17.215. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.181.17.215.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
