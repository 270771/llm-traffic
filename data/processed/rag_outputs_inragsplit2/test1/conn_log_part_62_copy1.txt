Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 163.76.120.97 to 163.21.32.70, and it appears only once.
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the count rule.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Other observations:
- The ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic from 203.65.114.222 could indicate network scanning or traceroute-like activity, which may warrant further investigation.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the best classification for this traffic is normal ICMP error and control messages, not a flood.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for potential reconnaissance behavior due to high volume of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify such anomalies in the future.
