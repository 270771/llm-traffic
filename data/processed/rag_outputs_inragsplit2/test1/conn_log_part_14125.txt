Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or other anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have any history of suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly datasets.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate against heuristic 20 or other heuristics once context is provided.
