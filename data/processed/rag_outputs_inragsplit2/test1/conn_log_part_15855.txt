Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log may not log ICMP by default.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for other anomalies or suspicious traffic patterns, especially from IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts seen here.
