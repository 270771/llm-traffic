Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one victim, overwhelming it.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.157.249, 133.247.157.11, 133.247.157.246, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the victim host (35.169.51.96) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
  5. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
