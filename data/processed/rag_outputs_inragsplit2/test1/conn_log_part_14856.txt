Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without additional heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the volume of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs (139.179.133.57, 163.171.168.73) for any other suspicious activity or alerts in other logs.
