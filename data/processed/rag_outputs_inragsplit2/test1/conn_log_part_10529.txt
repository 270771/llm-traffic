Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.186.100.117 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided. By default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" as per common network attack classifications.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 54.186.100.117; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.186.100.117.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs if they are internal or under your control.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up forensic analysis.
