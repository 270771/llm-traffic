Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.127.34.186, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IP 35.127.34.186. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.127.34.186.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent attacking source IPs.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter attack traffic if volume escalates.
  5. Review and harden host firewall rules on 35.127.34.186 to drop unsolicited ICMP Echo Requests.
