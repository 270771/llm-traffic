Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided log snippet, and no anomaly records or heuristic context to suggest otherwise.  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or related heuristics once more data or context is available.
