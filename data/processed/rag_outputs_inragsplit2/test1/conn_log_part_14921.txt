Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.197), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 has a history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ping flood behavior.
