Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 161.67.42.226 to multiple destination IPs (203.78.x.x range). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from this single source IP within a short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 161.67.42.226; Destination IPs include 203.78.176.163, 203.78.189.184, 203.78.181.83, 203.78.171.209, 203.78.185.219, 203.78.171.214, 203.78.170.83, 203.78.176.140, 203.78.181.138, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.190.25, 203.78.189.190. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used, port fields are 8 and 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 161.67.42.226 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the attack volume escalates.
