Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destinations appear multiple times but do not reach the threshold of at least 10 instances from the same source to the same or multiple destinations within this snippet. The total count of ICMP type 8 entries from 133.16.14.149 is 10, but they are spread across different destination IPs, which is typical for normal network scanning or monitoring rather than a flood. Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV.

Other ICMP types (1, 13) are present but do not indicate ping flood since only type 8 is relevant for ping flood detection.

No heuristic or taxonomy data is available, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of anomaly records and the distribution of ICMP type 8 traffic suggest no attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in volume or concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination. Investigate if the source IP 133.16.14.149 is authorized to send ICMP traffic at this rate. If volume spikes or sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests occur, re-evaluate for ping flood.
