Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.34.186) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests overwhelming the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.11.29 through 133.247.173.162 range; destination IP: 35.127.34.186; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (35.127.34.186) for service degradation and consider isolating it from the network if impact is severe.
- Conduct a source traceback and coordinate with upstream providers or the source network administrators to stop the attack at origin.
- Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood mitigation steps.
