Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.115.224.159, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet are sending these echo requests in rapid succession, indicating a coordinated flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 157.17.102.46, 157.17.102.48, 157.17.52.62, etc.) targeting destination 3.115.224.159 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 3.115.224.159.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.
