Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 35.169.51.96 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.54.214, 157.17.185.2, 157.17.61.58, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 35.169.51.96 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify network operations and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
