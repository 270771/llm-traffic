Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one IP, exceeding the threshold of 10 instances.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 130.197.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges; destination IP 54.178.233.150; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood traffic.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.178.233.150.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services hosted on 54.178.233.150.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up actions.
