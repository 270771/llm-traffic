Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (timestamp 1641099668.439914), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The single ICMP Echo Request could be normal network behavior or a benign ping.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (139.179.133.57) to the destination (203.78.173.116).  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP if repeated ICMP Echo Requests are observed, as it may indicate reconnaissance or a developing attack.
