Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.80.126.221 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.80.126.221 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
  3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Notify upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external.
  5. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
