Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 139.179.133.57 and 203.78.177.156).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (1, 11, 3, 13) indicate different ICMP message types such as destination unreachable, time exceeded, or parameter problem, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of various ICMP types may warrant further investigation into network health or misconfigurations but does not indicate a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP error messages (types 3, 11, 13) for possible network issues or scanning activity.  
- Obtain or define heuristic and taxonomy context to improve anomaly detection accuracy.
