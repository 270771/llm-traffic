Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP, 35.130.188.37, targeting multiple destination IPs within the 203.78.x.x range. This pattern of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.130.188.37; Destination IPs include 203.78.189.133, 203.78.180.51, 203.78.180.145, 203.78.189.138, 203.78.190.207, 203.78.151.198, 203.78.190.198, 203.78.170.126, 203.78.191.199, 203.78.151.197, 203.78.191.240, 203.78.170.65, 203.78.182.19, 203.78.181.10, 203.78.179.68, 203.78.179.88.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.130.188.37 at the network perimeter firewall to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS systems.
- Consider deploying network-level ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection to prevent recurrence.
