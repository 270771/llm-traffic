Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest other attack types.

No known heuristics or taxonomy apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
