Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from one source.
- The involved IP address is 163.171.168.73 (source), targeting multiple destination IPs such as 163.252.115.252, 203.78.164.3, 163.252.240.46, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or other sources.
- Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source is external and persistent.
