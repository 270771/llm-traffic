Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 37.135.249.194 to 203.78.187.167), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume and mixed ICMP types suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 37.135.249.194 or destination 203.78.187.167 appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
