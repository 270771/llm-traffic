Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 45.32.19.188 to 203.78.205.116). The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- The other ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods and may indicate normal network error messages.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No attack is present. The traffic does not match ping flood patterns or any other known attack based on the given data. Further investigation is not required unless additional logs show increased ICMP type 8 traffic or anomalous IP behavior.
