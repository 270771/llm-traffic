Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP port 0 (standard for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP ranges if they are known malicious or external.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
