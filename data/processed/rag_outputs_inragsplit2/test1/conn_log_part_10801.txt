Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range all targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no ports involved (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 35.183.65.24.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
