Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved; no such IPs or anomalies are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP logging in Zeek to ensure visibility of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as multiple TCP SYN (S0) entries from 167.249.133.167 indicate possible scanning or connection attempts, which may warrant further analysis under heuristic 6 (likely related to TCP SYN scans).
