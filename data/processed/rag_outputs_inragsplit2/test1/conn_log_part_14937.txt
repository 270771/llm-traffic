Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the single source IP 163.171.168.73 targeting multiple destination IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy data is provided, the most relevant heuristic is heuristic 20 (as per the initial instructions, heuristic 20 relates to known anomalous IPs or patterns in ICMP floods). The taxonomy class is best assigned as "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.132.21, 202.194.37.36, 163.252.27.199, 163.252.192.11, 203.78.190.198, 163.252.205.57, 163.252.234.228, 163.252.25.244, 203.78.180.173, 163.252.136.250, 203.78.184.222, 163.252.12.38, 163.252.27.238, 163.252.245.235, 203.78.190.240, 163.252.165.1, 203.78.184.242, 163.252.200.217, 133.251.127.206.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts or other anomalous behavior from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and persistent.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
