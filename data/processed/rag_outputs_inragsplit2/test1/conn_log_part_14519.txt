Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional suspicious indicators, this traffic appears benign.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs (221.234.55.83 and 203.78.195.196). If volume spikes or anomalies appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
