Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present here. The ICMP type 3 message typically indicates network or host unreachable conditions, which is normal network behavior rather than an attack. Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 3 messages spike abnormally, as that could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
