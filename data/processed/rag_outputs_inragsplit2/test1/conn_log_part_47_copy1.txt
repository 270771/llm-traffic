Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values 0, 3, and 8. Only one record has ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is required for ping flood detection.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in the snippet, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.
- The source IP 203.65.114.222 is sending multiple ICMP packets, but these are mostly type 3 (destination unreachable) or type 0 (echo reply), not type 8.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which would show a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 packets suggests normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity, as it is the most active sender here.
- Collect more data or anomaly context to confirm if any heuristic applies.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
