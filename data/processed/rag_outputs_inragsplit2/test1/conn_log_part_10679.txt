Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 1, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types correspond to Time Exceeded (type 11) and Echo Reply (type 1), which are normal ICMP message types used in network diagnostics and error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
