Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected parties owning the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
