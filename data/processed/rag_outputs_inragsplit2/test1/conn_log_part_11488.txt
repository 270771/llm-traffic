Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources to a single target) and fits the taxonomy class of ICMP-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs including 133.228.161.194, 133.228.168.61, 133.228.168.57, 133.228.161.195, 133.228.214.70, 133.228.165.53, 133.228.72.193, 133.228.72.207, 133.228.199.246, 133.228.168.106, 133.228.189.254, 133.228.119.193, 133.228.57.112, 133.228.220.1, 133.228.199.198, 133.228.234.61, 133.228.99.249, 133.228.251.200, 133.228.251.193, 133.228.141.201 targeting destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 3.83.92.175.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host 3.83.92.175 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
- Prepare for potential escalation by correlating with other logs for signs of multi-vector DoS attacks.
