Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 3, 11, or other types, with only two instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) observed (from 52.26.24.28 to 203.65.103.15 and from 13.43.166.59 to 203.65.103.15). The threshold for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated requests from the same source IPs. Investigate the sources 52.26.24.28 and 13.43.166.59 if ICMP echo requests persist or increase, as they are the only sources sending echo requests here.
