Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or repeated ICMP traffic spikes.
