Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The majority of ICMP traffic entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or other types, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641790826.463823), and there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 overall.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold for detection.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which requires multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests from a source to a destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages suggests normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity since it appears frequently but mostly with non-type 8 ICMP messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, re-evaluate with that context.
