Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs (all in the 133.247.x.x and one 218.59.249.48 range) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.229.78.71 within a very short time window. This pattern of multiple sources sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests, which matches the known ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from 133.247.0.0/16 and 218.59.249.48 targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
