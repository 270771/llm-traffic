Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log are 8, 3, and 3. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (first entry), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other two entries are ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which are unrelated to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 messages may indicate network issues but do not constitute an attack here.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 if repeated ICMP echo requests persist.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
