Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the log snippet are 3, 8, and 13. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 128.253.31.181 to 163.252.83.249). The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 13 = Timestamp) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. However, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages could warrant investigation into possible network issues or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 128.253.31.181 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
