Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no further connection establishment (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP-based anomalies.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture Echo Requests and Replies.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
