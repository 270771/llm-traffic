Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero or very low as indicated by the zeroes in relevant fields).
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which is below the threshold for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Collect and analyze full ICMP type fields in future logs to confirm packet types.
- Investigate if any other anomalies appear in related logs or anomaly feeds.
