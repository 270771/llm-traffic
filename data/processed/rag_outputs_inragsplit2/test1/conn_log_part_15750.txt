Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or a higher volume of ICMP traffic, this does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based DoS patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and increased frequency to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any anomalies if anomaly data becomes available, especially focusing on heuristic 20 if it appears later.
