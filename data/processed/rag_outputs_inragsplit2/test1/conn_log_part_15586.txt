Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.160.152.89) from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous source IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.119.243, 133.228.127.252, 133.228.57.7, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the target host (16.160.152.89) for resource exhaustion or service degradation.
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse within the network.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
