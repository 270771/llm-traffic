Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the IP 54.184.243.206, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies were explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, but the volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to a single destination IP strongly align with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) typically used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x and 130.197.x.x ranges; destination IP is 54.184.243.206. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.184.243.206.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16 and 130.197.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP ranges.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
