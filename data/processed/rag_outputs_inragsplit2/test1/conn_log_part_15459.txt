Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.161.126.169 from multiple different source IPs. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to a single target matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the observed behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 1: ICMP Echo Request flood; taxonomy class: DoS/DoS Flood).
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 203.78.184.244 (though that one is ICMP type 3, not type 8), all targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the key indicator is the ICMP type 8 field.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules on intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
  3. Monitor the target host 16.161.126.169 for service degradation or signs of compromise.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack.
  5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to assist with upstream filtering.
