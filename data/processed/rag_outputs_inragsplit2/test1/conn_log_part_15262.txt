Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 0 and 128, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from or to these IPs.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other security systems or threat intelligence feeds.
