Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one occurrence is logged. Since the ICMP type is not explicitly 8 (echo request), and there are fewer than 10 instances, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single OTH (other) connection state entry. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate threat is evident.

Next steps: Investigate additional ICMP traffic logs to check for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or multiple connections from the same source IP. Also, verify if any heuristic 20-related IPs appear in extended logs to rule out stealthy ping floods.
