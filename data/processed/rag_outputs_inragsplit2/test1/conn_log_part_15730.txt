Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows only two entries with ICMP type 8 (echo request), with counts of 14 and 112 packets respectively. While 112 packets is above the threshold of 10, there is no indication of repeated or sustained flooding from a single source IP targeting a single destination IP.  
- Other ICMP types present (3 and 11) are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and other ICMP messages without signs of volumetric flooding or attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume from single sources to single destinations.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 sending 112 echo requests to 8.86.211.249 for any unusual behavior or repeated patterns over time.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
