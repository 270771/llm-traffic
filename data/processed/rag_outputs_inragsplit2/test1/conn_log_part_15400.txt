Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from IPs 47.92.212.151 and 203.78.177.156). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability or scanning activity, but this is not a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns over time.
