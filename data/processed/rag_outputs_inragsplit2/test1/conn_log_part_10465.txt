Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 47.246.124.32 to 203.78.186.59 with a single instance (count=1), which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or correlating with other logs for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.
