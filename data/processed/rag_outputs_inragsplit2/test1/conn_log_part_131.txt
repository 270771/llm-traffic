Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.002 seconds total). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where an attacker overwhelms targets with rapid ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source in a short interval, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; Destination IPs include 203.65.100.58, 163.21.220.30, 163.21.64.22, 203.65.113.96, and multiple others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
  3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic volume escalates to mitigate at the ISP level.
