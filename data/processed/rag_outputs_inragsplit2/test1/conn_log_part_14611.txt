Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.157.8, 157.17.61.59, 157.17.66.234, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify potentially compromised hosts within the source IP range that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
