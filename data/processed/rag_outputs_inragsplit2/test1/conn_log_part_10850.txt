Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP types in the log snippet are 0, 1, 3, 11, and 13, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only single instances of each ICMP type, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types seen (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination.  
- Investigate if any future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect other attack types.
