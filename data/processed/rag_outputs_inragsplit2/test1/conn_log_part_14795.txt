Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 35.119.5.36 to 163.252.71.140, and there is only one instance of it. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request and a single ICMP error message is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any IPs appear repeatedly with ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold in a larger dataset.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
