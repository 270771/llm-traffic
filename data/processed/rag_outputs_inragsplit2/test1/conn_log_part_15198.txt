Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no indication of type 8 (echo request) or multiple repeated packets. Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or any known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but is insufficient alone to indicate flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.78.181.77 to 67.37.105.13. Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
