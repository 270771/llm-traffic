Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values 0, 3, or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP connections logged, far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious IPs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to better classify future suspicious traffic.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages correspond to network issues or scanning activity.
