Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.115.224.159. This matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x and 52.158.x.x ranges are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.115.224.159 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests to 3.115.224.159 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blacklisting.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation such as traffic scrubbing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
