Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence from 161.67.42.226 to 202.100.171.198. This does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly context, this traffic appears normal or benign.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if 161.67.42.226 or 202.100.171.198 appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of ICMP flooding emerges.
