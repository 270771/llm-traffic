Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13, 1, and 10. None of these are type 8, which is required for a ping flood (ICMP Echo Request).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types seen correspond to:  
- Type 13: Timestamp request  
- Type 1: Destination unreachable  
- Type 10: Router advertisement  

These do not match typical ping flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or other anomalies in different logs.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies if they arise.
