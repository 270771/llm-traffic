Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 1, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristics and taxonomy context are unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential flooding or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate if any other protocols or ports show anomalous behavior.
