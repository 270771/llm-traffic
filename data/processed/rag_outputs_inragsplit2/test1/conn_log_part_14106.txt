Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 4 distinct entries with type 8 are observed targeting the same destination IP 54.166.249.180 (from src IPs 133.247.229.48, 133.247.86.119, 133.247.228.78, and 133.247.148.28). This count is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (1, 0, 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests and replies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unknown or suspicious in other contexts.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify any emerging patterns.
