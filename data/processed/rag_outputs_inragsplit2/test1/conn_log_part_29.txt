Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP packets with type 8 (echo request) to a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) in a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which is the only type relevant for ping flood detection.
- The volume exceeds the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, confirming the attack without any known anomalous IP exceptions.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (commonly associated with volumetric ICMP flood attacks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.16.x.x range targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor the destination host (52.190.120.127) for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle ICMP traffic if the attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools that can dynamically respond to such volumetric attacks.
