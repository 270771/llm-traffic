Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8 respectively. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) is not relevant to ping floods, as only type 8 indicates ping requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if repeated echo requests occur.  
- Investigate if the source IP 157.17.48.182 or destination 3.118.117.235 have any prior suspicious activity.
