Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is indicated by the 11th column (ICMP type/code). The first entry shows ICMP type 0, and the second entry shows ICMP type 84, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with types other than 8, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns, which require multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic volume.
- Collect more detailed heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
