Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 61.1.51.193 to 54.26.117.119, and there is only one such instance in the snippet, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 61.1.51.193 if repeated ICMP Echo Requests increase significantly.
