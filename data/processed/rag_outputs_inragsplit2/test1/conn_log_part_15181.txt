Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (54.229.78.71) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are Echo Requests, which are used in ping floods.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from standard ping flood detection heuristics) which flags multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many sources targeting one host.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack" due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.229.78.71.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic upstream if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing if the attack escalates.
