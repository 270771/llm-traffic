Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs 157.17.188.205 and 203.78.179.25 for unusual behavior or repeated error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies if they arise.
