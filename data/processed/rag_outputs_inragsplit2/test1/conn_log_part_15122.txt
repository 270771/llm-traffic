Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other datasets.
