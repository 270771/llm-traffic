Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.228.4.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 202.194.17.61 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.228.4.24. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are internal or known to be compromised.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for signs of lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
