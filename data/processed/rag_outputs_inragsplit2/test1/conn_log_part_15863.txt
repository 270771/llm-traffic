Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 133.247.137.149) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24. Additionally, engage upstream providers to filter or block offending source IPs. Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS mitigation capabilities targeting ICMP floods.
