Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (from 157.17.48.189 to 44.61.16.153).  
- The other ICMP entry has type 3, which is not relevant for ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is not met here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP Echo Request does not constitute an attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which could indicate early-stage reconnaissance or flooding.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
