Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
