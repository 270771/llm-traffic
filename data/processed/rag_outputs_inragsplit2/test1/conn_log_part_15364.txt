Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present. The other entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and only one ICMP type 8 packet is logged.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic references are found in the anomaly CSV.  
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 packets may indicate normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.177.156 or destination 24.195.4.1 appear in future anomaly reports or match known heuristics once available.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
