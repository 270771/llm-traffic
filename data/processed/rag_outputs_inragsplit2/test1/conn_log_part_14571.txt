Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of 1 or 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero; thus, the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP traffic appears to be sporadic and low volume, consistent with normal network behavior or other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, echo reply).

Next steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP type 8 packets increase significantly or if anomalies appear in future logs.
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential ping floods early.
- Correlate with other network logs or IDS alerts for comprehensive threat detection.
