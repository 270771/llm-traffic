Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating primarily from IP 133.16.14.149 targeting numerous distinct destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include source IP 133.16.14.149 and multiple destination IPs such as 23.222.79.252, 165.1.152.130, 2.213.218.3, 104.66.131.251, 165.1.129.60, 23.189.53.250, 104.119.65.248, 23.230.241.255, 23.178.128.251, 104.119.193.250, and 65.119.142.122. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host and mitigate potential impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
