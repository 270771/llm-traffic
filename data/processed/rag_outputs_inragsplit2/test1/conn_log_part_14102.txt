Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), specifically targeting the IP 54.166.249.180. There are more than 10 such instances within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.163.213, 133.247.20.70, 133.247.57.148, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.166.249.180. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target IP 54.166.249.180 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
