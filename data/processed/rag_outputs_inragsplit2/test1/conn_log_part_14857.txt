Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source in a short time frame.
- The involved IP address is the source 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.246.230, 203.78.164.13, 163.252.234.248, etc.). ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or other sources.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
