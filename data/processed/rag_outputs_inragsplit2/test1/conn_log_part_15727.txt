Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 133.228.170.168 and 133.247.49.34). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious behavior.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
