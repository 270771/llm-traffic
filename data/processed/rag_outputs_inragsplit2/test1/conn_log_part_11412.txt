Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (as per your instructions) related to known anomalous source IPs performing ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; Destination IPs include 163.252.13.105, 163.252.184.26, 163.252.75.57, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential takedown or filtering.

This targeted and high-volume ICMP echo request traffic confirms an active ping flood attack.
