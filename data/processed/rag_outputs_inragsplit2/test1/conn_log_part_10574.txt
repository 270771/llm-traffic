Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.183.65.24 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP: Source IP 35.183.65.24 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or devices that may be generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
