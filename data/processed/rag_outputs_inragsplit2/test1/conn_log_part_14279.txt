Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP echo request (type 8) packets sent to a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances targeting the same destination IP.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.34.244, 133.247.184.92, 133.247.50.149, etc.) targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (echo request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 157.187.159.183.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or participation in a botnet; consider blacklisting or blocking these IPs if confirmed malicious.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider engaging upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if the attack volume escalates.
