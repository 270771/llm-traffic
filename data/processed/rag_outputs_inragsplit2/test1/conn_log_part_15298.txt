Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet show ICMP types 6 and 4, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are fewer than 10 instances of type 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Checking for other ICMP types that might indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Gathering more comprehensive logs or anomaly data to correlate suspicious activity.
