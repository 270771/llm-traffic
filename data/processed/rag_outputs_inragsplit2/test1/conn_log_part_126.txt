Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances (over 20) of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the same source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds), indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; Destination IPs include 163.21.114.46, 163.21.24.20, 163.21.210.57, 163.21.65.55, 203.65.121.246, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases or spreads.
