Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood, are absent.
- No anomalies or suspicious IPs related to ICMP traffic are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances of such traffic, the criteria for detecting a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, which could be normal scanning or benign traffic.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or DoS attempts.
