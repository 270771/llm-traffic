Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 3 or 11, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP error messages could warrant investigation into network issues or misconfigurations but does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) to rule out routing or connectivity problems.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
