Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No heuristic or taxonomy applies here due to lack of matching data. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
