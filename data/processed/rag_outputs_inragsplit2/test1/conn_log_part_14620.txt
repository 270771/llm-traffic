Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single host, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (157.17.230.129, 157.17.109.214, 157.17.212.69, 157.17.212.96, 157.17.239.120, 157.17.45.231, 157.17.239.172, 157.17.250.173, 157.17.250.56, 157.17.230.198, 157.17.189.153) targeting destination 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader DDoS activity.
