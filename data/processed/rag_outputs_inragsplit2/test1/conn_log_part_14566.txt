Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11, which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record is type 8 (echo request), but there is only 1 instance of it, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data become available that show repeated ICMP echo requests or other suspicious patterns.
