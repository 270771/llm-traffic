Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All provided Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries exist in the snippet, which is mandatory to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, not flooding.

Since no ICMP echo requests are detected, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. The absence of anomaly data and heuristic context prevents further classification, but the logs suggest possible reconnaissance or scanning activity (heuristic typically related to SYN scan detection).

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts for potential scanning behavior.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture echo requests for future detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.
