Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.22.191.77 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. Specifically, there are at least 11 instances of ICMP type 8 packets directed at 3.22.191.77, satisfying the threshold of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets for ping flood detection.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: many ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly from multiple sources to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most relevant heuristic is heuristic 20 (as per the instructions, heuristic 20 relates to known anomalous IPs or patterns in ping floods). The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.165.155, 133.247.165.217, 133.247.107.202, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 3.22.191.77 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
