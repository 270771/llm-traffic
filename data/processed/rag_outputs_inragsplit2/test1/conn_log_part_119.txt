Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets observed are very few (only 2 entries: one from 157.161.40.85 to 34.58.63.244 and one from 54.248.150.12 to 203.65.103.15).
- The majority of ICMP traffic in the log is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or other types, not type 8.
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages may indicate network scanning or misconfiguration but does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the sources of repeated ICMP type 3 messages (e.g., 203.65.114.222) for potential network issues or reconnaissance activity.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that might indicate a developing ping flood.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
