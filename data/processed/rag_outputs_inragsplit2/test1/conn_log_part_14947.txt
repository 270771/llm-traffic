Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.214, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The heuristic for ping flood requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination 203.78.173.214 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
