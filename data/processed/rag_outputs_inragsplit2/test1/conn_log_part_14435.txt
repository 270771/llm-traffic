Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 0 and 8, but the entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are fewer than 10 instances. Specifically, only one record shows ICMP type 8 as the source port (52.158.11.176 â†’ 163.252.37.43), and the others have ICMP type 8 as the destination port or do not clearly indicate multiple repeated Echo Requests from the same source.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination, the traffic does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if any IPs begin to exhibit suspicious behavior matching heuristic 20 or other known attack patterns.
