Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and one IPv6 source (excluded as it uses ICMP type 128/129, not type 8), targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in the network IDS/IPS.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  5. Notify network operations to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
