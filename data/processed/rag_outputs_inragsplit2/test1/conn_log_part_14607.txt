Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection log entry. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns or anomalies.
