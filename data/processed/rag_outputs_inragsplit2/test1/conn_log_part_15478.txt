Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances cannot be met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connections appear normal with no signs of flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to confirm the absence of ICMP echo requests.
- Enable or review anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to catch potential ping floods.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics once available, which may indicate known anomalous IPs involved in ping floods.
