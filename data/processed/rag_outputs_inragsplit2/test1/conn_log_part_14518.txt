Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as the current snippet only shows TCP/UDP connections.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other anomalies or suspicious patterns in TCP/UDP traffic that may indicate different attack vectors.
