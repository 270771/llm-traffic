Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although there are multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request), the total count of such instances is exactly 9 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the provided CSV.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 3 entry (Destination Unreachable) is a normal network response and does not indicate flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of anomalies suggests normal or benign ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated patterns from the same source IPs. Investigate if any of the source IPs begin to exceed the threshold or if new anomaly records appear.
