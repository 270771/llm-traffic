Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly "3" (Destination Unreachable) or "11" (Time Exceeded), not "8" (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- Only one entry shows ICMP type "8" (Echo Request), and it is a single instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages suggests normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Investigate the source IP 15.146.150.124 that sent the single ICMP type 8 packet to 203.65.103.15 for any unusual behavior.
- Collect more data or anomaly context to better correlate suspicious activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
