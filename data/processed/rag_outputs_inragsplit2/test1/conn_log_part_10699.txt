Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.206.231.130, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.206.231.130. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to block or throttle excessive ICMP type 8 traffic. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and block or quarantine the attacking source IPs. Notify upstream providers if attack volume escalates. Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
