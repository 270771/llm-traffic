Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 11, 128, and 8. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 3.89.103.26 to 203.78.148.105), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 128 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP echo requests beyond the threshold.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems if available to identify emerging threats.
