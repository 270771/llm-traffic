Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts in the monitoring system.
- Monitor for other suspicious TCP/UDP anomalies since many TCP connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity. This could relate to heuristic 6 (SYN scan) if such context were available.
