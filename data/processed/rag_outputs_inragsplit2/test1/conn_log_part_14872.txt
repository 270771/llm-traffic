Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.101.165.68, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.97.126, 133.247.101.165, 133.247.144.59, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.101.165.68. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 18.101.165.68.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host and consider isolating it if service degradation occurs.
  4. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and update firewall rules accordingly.
  5. Review upstream provider or ISP filtering options to mitigate volumetric ICMP floods.
