Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these echo requests to multiple destination IPs indicate an attempt to overwhelm targets with ICMP traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to multiple destination IPs on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the attack persists or escalates.
