Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field (the 6th and 7th fields after IPs and ports). Here, the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). The entries show ICMP traffic but do not confirm type 8.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request (type 8) traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in logs to better identify ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in source/destination IP behavior.
