Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one ICMP record with type 8 (echo request) is present (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.209).  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 (time exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends echo requests.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to correlate with potential threats.
