Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (143.224.94.6) to multiple destination IPs within the 133.26.144.0/24 subnet.
- All ICMP packets are type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests to many hosts strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 is referenced in the instructions as related to known anomalous IPs, but none are found here).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IP: 143.224.94.6 (ICMP type 8 sender)
- Destination IPs: Multiple hosts in 133.26.144.0/24 subnet
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 143.224.94.6 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to internal hosts.
