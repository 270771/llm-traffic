Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (157.17.176.79, 157.17.176.205, 157.17.232.1, 157.17.194.120, 157.17.224.163, 157.17.54.134, 157.17.171.168, 157.17.171.174, 157.17.231.212, 157.17.175.211) all targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate upstream network devices for possible source spoofing or amplification.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
