Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP events, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network or host unreachable errors, which are normal network behavior rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the hosts involved (202.194.58.107, 167.84.162.152, 133.228.250.199, 146.218.244.59) report connectivity issues, as ICMP type 3 can indicate network problems.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
