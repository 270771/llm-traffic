Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP anomaly is detected.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out by network devices.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests in future logs.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP-related alerts to ensure no ping flood attempts are missed.
