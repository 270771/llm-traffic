Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The conn.log snippet shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target. The presence of multiple unique source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession strongly indicates a distributed ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) if those IPs were flagged, but since none are found, the default heuristic for ping flood detection applies: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from multiple sources targeting a single destination.  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Destination IP: 52.236.221.123 (target of the ping flood)  
- Source IPs: 157.17.169.38, 157.17.169.199, 157.17.114.23, 157.17.58.249, 157.17.25.198, 157.17.17.66, 157.17.230.129, 157.17.17.178, 157.17.75.6, 157.17.114.196, 157.17.75.74  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or blocking these IPs if confirmed malicious.  
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.  
5. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts and adjust firewall rules accordingly.  
6. Ensure the target host has appropriate ICMP rate limiting configured to prevent resource exhaustion.
