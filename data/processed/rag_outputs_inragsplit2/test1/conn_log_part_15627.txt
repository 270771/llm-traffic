Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; Destination IPs include 163.252.7.151, 163.252.129.105, 163.252.7.244, 163.252.145.153, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.221.141.21 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet for signs of degradation or service disruption.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external to coordinate blocking or filtering.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
