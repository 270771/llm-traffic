Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in your instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.237.39, 163.252.181.247, 163.252.83.30, 163.252.63.249, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
5. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
6. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
