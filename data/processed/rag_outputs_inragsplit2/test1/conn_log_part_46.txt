Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. While there are multiple ICMP type 8 entries, the total count of such entries from the same source IP to the same destination IP does not reach the threshold of at least 10 instances per source-destination pair to indicate a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 packets are distributed across multiple source IPs (e.g., 35.71.8.235, 133.16.14.149, 52.190.42.37) and multiple destination IPs, with no single source IP repeatedly sending a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets to one destination.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would lower the threshold.
- Some ICMP packets have types other than 8 (e.g., type 3, 1), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP activity or low-level scanning/pings.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned. However, if investigation is warranted, focus should be on monitoring any source IP that begins to send a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination, as that would meet the ping flood criteria.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic volume per source-destination pair.
- Set alerts for any source IP exceeding 10 ICMP type 8 packets in a short time window to the same destination.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in other protocols.
