Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically indicate traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP type 11 traffic patterns or other anomalies.
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to confirm if this is benign or part of a reconnaissance activity.
