Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detection of ping flood patterns.
- Without ICMP traffic, no other ICMP-based attacks can be inferred.
- The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative attack classification can be applied here.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs specifically capturing ICMP traffic (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable or review IDS/IPS alerts for ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from single sources.
