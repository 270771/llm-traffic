Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The majority of ICMP traffic entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 from source IP 18.112.90.42 to multiple destination IPs, indicating multiple pings sent in a short time frame. However, the volume and distribution do not clearly indicate a flood, as the count is just around 10 and spread across different destinations. Also, no known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override the threshold.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest this traffic is malicious or part of a ping flood attack. The last entry with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 133.228.163.78 is a normal response and does not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume from the same source IP to a single destination IP, which would better indicate a ping flood. Investigate if 18.112.90.42 is generating unusually high ICMP traffic over a longer period or if other logs show signs of network degradation or DoS symptoms.
