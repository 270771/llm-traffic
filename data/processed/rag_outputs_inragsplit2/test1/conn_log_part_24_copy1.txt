Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.239.183.175) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP message types.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this meets the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances targeting the same destination IP.
- Most likely heuristic: Heuristic 20 (related to known anomalous IPs or ping flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Destination IP: 54.239.183.175 (target of the flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.161.250.253, 157.161.58.149, 157.161.157.76, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are 0 or irrelevant.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.239.183.175.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor network and host performance for signs of degradation or service impact.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with ICMP flood detection and mitigation capabilities.
- Alert incident response team to investigate potential compromise of source hosts or botnet involvement.
- Document and log all mitigation steps and traffic patterns for future forensic analysis.
