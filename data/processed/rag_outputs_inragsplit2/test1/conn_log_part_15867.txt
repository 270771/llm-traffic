Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.228.4.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and destination IP 54.228.4.24. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used, no ports are relevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Monitor network and host performance metrics on 54.228.4.24 for signs of service degradation or failure.
