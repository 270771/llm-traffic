Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified (the type field is missing or marked as "-"), and only one packet is recorded. A ping flood requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are not present here. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without ICMP type 8 or multiple repeated packets, this traffic does not match ping flood or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Collect more connection log data to identify repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Verify ICMP type fields are properly logged to enable accurate detection.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume from or to these IPs for further investigation.
