Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries except one have ICMP type 0 or 11, not type 8 (Echo Request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8, which is insufficient to meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which requires multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet from 52.103.181.209 to 203.65.103.15 for legitimacy, but it alone does not indicate an attack.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
