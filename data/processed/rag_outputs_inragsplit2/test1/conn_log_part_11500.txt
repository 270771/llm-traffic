Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.249.88.154) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm the network or hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source targeting many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.88.154; Destination IPs include 163.252.9.182, 163.252.12.59, 163.252.99.211, 163.252.99.114, 163.252.99.168, 163.252.9.117, 163.252.244.122, 163.252.244.6, 163.252.244.79, 163.252.213.1, 163.252.220.5, 163.252.213.190, 163.252.213.154, 163.252.220.6, 163.252.150.91, 163.252.150.102, 163.252.150.93.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.249.88.154 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or resource exhaustion caused by the flood.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or related suspicious activity.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
- Consider engaging upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the offending IP if the attack persists.
