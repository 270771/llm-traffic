Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11; none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- The traffic appears to be various ICMP error messages (type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded), which are normal network control messages, not a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out ping flood, and no other suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.65.114.222.
- Investigate the cause of multiple ICMP error messages from this IP to various destinations, as it may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
