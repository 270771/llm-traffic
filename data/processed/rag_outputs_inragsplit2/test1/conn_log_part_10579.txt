Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~same timestamp). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where a host overwhelms multiple targets with echo requests.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type and code fields confirm echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
