Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short timestamp window, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.117.38, 133.247.95.167, 133.247.37.157, etc.) are sending ICMP echo requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25), suggesting a distributed ping flood targeting these hosts.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (high volume ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.117.38, 133.247.95.167, 133.247.37.157, etc.)
- Destinations: 54.214.205.182, 3.115.159.25, and one instance to 23.23.133.3

Ports:
- ICMP does not use ports; the field is 0 as expected.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if business operations allow.
