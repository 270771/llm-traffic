Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.161.126.169. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the targeted host.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP ranges if attack persists.
