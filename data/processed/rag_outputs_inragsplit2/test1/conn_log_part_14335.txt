Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP echo request traffic from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if they are legitimate hosts or internal assets.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other similar ICMP floods or related anomalies.
- Notify upstream providers or the ISP about the abusive source IP to coordinate mitigation.
- Implement or tune existing DDoS protection mechanisms to detect and mitigate volumetric ICMP floods in the future.
