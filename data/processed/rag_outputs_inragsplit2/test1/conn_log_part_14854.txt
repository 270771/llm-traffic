Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 52.237.221.62 to destination 203.78.170.83, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated in the snippet. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Verify if the ICMP type 3 message indicates network issues or misconfigurations.
