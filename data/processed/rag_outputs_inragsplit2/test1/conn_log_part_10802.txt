Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.35.164, 133.247.143.224, 133.247.31.190, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.183.65.24.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attempts.
