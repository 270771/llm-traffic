Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 70.108.180.172, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.
- Other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential slow or low-rate ICMP attacks.
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
