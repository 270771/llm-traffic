Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8 to indicate an echo request (ping). In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries show ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 3.21.148.176 and 13.58.1.2). The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is only 2, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood attack unless anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest such exceptions.

Most ICMP traffic here is type 3 (destination unreachable) or type 11 (time exceeded), which are not indicative of ping floods but could be related to network scanning or other ICMP-based diagnostics.

No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available to assign a heuristic number or taxonomy class. Given the data, no ping flood or other clear attack pattern is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.
