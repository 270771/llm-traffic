Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.30.218.60) from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.240.227.178, 133.240.121.246, 133.240.37.235, etc.) targeting destination 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP echo request.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 3.30.218.60.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other network logs.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
