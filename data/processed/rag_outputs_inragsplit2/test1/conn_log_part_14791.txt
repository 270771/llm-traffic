Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.119.5.36) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.119.5.36; Destination IPs include 163.252.50.2, 163.252.13.107, 163.252.247.142, 163.252.79.254, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 35.119.5.36 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or similar sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
