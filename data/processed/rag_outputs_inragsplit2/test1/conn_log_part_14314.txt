Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears in multiple entries from source IP 3.89.103.26 to various destination IPs, but only 5 instances are present in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the count requirement.  
- Other ICMP types (e.g., type 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to multiple destinations.  
- Investigate the source IP 3.89.103.26 for unusual behavior or reputation issues.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential emerging threats.
