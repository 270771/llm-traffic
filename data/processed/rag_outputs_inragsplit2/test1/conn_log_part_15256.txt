Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only two ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets directed at 202.194.58.107, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators. The other ICMP entries are type 3 or unspecified types, which do not match the ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IP, and collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential flooding. Investigate the sources 15.130.145.131 and 54.193.88.34 if their ICMP traffic volume increases or if other suspicious behavior is observed.
