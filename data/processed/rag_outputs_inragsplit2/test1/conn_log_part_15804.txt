Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or indicate an attack.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence sources.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
