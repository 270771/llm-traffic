Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.35.69, 133.247.29.250, 133.247.57.199, etc.) targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the echo request nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation and consider isolating it if the attack persists.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate potentially compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
