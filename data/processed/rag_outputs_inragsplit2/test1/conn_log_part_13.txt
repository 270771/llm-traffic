Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (129.43.86.1) sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where a host overwhelms multiple targets with echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 from the same source, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.86.1; Destination IPs include 203.114.237.32 through 203.114.237.59 and others in that subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 129.43.86.1 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or subnet.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Notify network operations to check for any service disruptions on the targeted IP range.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems to automate future detection and mitigation.
