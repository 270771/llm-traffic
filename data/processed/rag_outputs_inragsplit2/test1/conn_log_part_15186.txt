Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all relevant entries, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time frame from multiple source IPs (all starting with 133.247.x.x) to a single destination IP strongly indicates a coordinated ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range; destination IP 54.229.78.71; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns targeting 54.229.78.71.
- Monitor the affected host and network for signs of service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for potential mitigation.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled.
