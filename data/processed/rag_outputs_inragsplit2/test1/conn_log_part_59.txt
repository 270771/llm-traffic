Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to many different destination IPs. There are well over 10 such instances within a very short time window (~2 seconds), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or explicit heuristics are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the attacker; destination IPs include 72.248.164.255, 23.179.213.252, 104.65.48.255, 23.70.189.253, 23.76.96.2, 104.81.84.253, 23.81.49.253, 104.122.86.241, 23.189.110.3, 208.73.31.252, 104.127.204.7, 204.108.68.241, 104.121.232.250, 23.210.173.250, 23.94.120.4.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to ensure no internal hosts are compromised and generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
