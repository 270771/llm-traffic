Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 203.78.177.156 to 67.133.135.249), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) entries do not indicate ping flood activity.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports matching heuristic 20 are present to override the instance count rule.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other ICMP-related anomalies.
