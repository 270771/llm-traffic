Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (ICMP code 0) from source 61.1.51.193 to destination 15.185.99.42, but the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. Given the lack of multiple ICMP Echo Requests and no known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No immediate attack is detected. Further monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and types is recommended to detect any escalation or other ICMP-based anomalies.
