Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.206.231.130 from multiple different source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.8.105, 157.17.22.134, 157.17.110.190, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 157.17.0.0/16 to the victim IP 54.206.231.130.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking sources.
- Monitor the victim host for service degradation or outages and prepare to apply host-based firewall rules to drop ICMP Echo Requests if necessary.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate potentially compromised hosts within the 157.17.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Document and alert the security operations team for ongoing monitoring and incident response.
