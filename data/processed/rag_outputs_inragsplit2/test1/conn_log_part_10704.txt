Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 115.47.156.131 to 133.102.59.166), which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same or related IPs.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP echo request is part of a larger pattern in other logs or timeframes.  
- Verify if the source IP 115.47.156.131 or destination IP 133.102.59.166 have any prior history of suspicious activity.
