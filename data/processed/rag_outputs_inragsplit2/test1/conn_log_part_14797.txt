Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.30, and there is only 1 instance of this type.  
- The other ICMP packets are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp), which do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, so this does not match the ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for related anomalies.
