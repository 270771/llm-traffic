Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic within a very short time window, originating from multiple source IPs (e.g., 44.61.12.164, 133.247.135.209, 157.17.110.39) targeting a small set of destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.243.187, 52.42.116.124, 54.212.29.159). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies such as ping floods. The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"Network Denial of Service" (DoS)**.

Involved IP addresses and ports:  
- Source IPs: 44.61.12.164, 133.247.135.209, 133.247.43.193, 157.17.110.39, 157.17.110.62, and others in the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges.  
- Destination IPs: 163.252.243.187, 52.42.116.124, 54.212.29.159, 163.252.237.196, 163.252.237.228, 163.252.234.147, 163.252.234.10, 163.252.93.72.  
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter traffic from the attacking IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further volumetric ICMP anomalies and adjust firewall rules accordingly.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP traffic anomaly detection tools to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.
