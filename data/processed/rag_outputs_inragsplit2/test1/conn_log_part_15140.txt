Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type is not provided explicitly in the Zeek conn.log snippet, but the connection state is OTH (other), and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instances are visible.  
- Only a single ICMP connection record is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP connection record. The OTH state may indicate an incomplete or unusual connection but is insufficient to classify as an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by collecting more ICMP traffic logs to check for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Enable detailed ICMP type logging in Zeek to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in source/destination IPs that could trigger heuristic 20 or other known heuristics once available.
