Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies, no evidence supports a ping flood or any other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable or review anomaly detection rules for ICMP type 8 traffic to catch future ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics once available, which may indicate suspicious IPs related to ping floods.
