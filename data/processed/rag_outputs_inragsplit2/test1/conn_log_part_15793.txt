Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) commonly used in network security, and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.16.3, 163.252.4.215, 163.252.67.98, 163.252.140.137, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or mitigating the attack.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
