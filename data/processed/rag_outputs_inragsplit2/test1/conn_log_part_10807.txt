Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from many sources to one destination.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.127.57, 133.247.163.204, 133.247.163.208, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 is critical here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.183.65.24.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation.
- Monitor the target host and network for service degradation or further attack vectors.
