Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

No heuristic or taxonomy data is available to assign here. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
