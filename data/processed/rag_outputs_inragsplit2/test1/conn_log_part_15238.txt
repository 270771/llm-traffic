Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic or anomaly data present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically indicate traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 packets or higher volume from these IPs.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies related to these IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to better classify future suspicious ICMP traffic.
