Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.254.250.38 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily source 54.254.250.38 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP 54.254.250.38 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
