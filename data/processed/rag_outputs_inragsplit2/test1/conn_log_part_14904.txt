Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 8 in the source port field, but these do not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) in the expected ICMP type field. The conn.log snippet does not explicitly show ICMP type 8 in the relevant field for these entries.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries total, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information if possible to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts for suspicious activity.
