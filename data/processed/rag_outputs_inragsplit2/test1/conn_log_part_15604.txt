Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 0 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one record shows ICMP type 8, and the other is type 0 (Echo Reply).  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, with only 1 instance of type 8, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack pattern is evident from the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
