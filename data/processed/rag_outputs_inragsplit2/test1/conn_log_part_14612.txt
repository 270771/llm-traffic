Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 161.67.57.135, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood.
- The volume exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances, confirming the attack without needing anomaly exceptions.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 157.17.188.83, 157.17.60.6, 157.17.160.75, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
  
Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 161.67.57.135.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
- Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if the attack volume increases.
