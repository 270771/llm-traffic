Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.72). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests without legitimate reason.
