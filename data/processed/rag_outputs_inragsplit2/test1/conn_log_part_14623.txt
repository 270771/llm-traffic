Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.188.75, 157.17.254.5, 157.17.49.67, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
