Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 52.17.245.190 to 203.65.103.15, and there is only one such instance in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 11 or missing type fields, which do not correspond to ping requests.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated in the data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over a longer time window.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify suspicious IPs or behaviors.
