Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two instances from IPs 183.249.233.225 and 163.171.168.73, each with a count of 1 packet. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The third ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The low volume and lack of repeated ICMP echo requests suggest normal or benign ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches once available.  
- Verify if ICMP traffic patterns change to meet ping flood criteria (â‰¥10 echo requests) before raising alerts.
