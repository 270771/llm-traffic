Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Since ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, this traffic does not indicate a denial-of-service or flooding attack.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of anomalies. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
