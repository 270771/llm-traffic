Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating primarily from 54.183.76.138 and some from 18.22.226.126, targeting many different destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern where an attacker sends numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 18.22.226.126; multiple destination IPs in 163.252.0.0/16; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 18.22.226.126 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and increase logging for these source IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of these source hosts.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services to protect critical infrastructure.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, allowing only legitimate diagnostic use.
