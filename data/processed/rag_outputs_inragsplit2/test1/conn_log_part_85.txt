Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" based on standard cybersecurity taxonomies.
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97; Destination IPs include multiple 163.21.x.x addresses and one 203.65.112.181; ICMP protocol, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
