Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple anomalous source IPs targeting a single destination with ICMP type 8) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.19.5, 133.247.71.173, 133.247.224.57, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation service to filter or absorb the flood traffic.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP range that may be participating in the attack.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
