Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating primarily from IP 18.22.226.126 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets exceed the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the presence of a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source IP 18.22.226.126 (primary attacker), secondary source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 113.6.50.51 also sending ICMP type 8 packets; destination IPs are multiple hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 18.22.226.126 and other suspicious sources.
- Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
- Notify affected network owners of the targeted IP range to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the attacker IPs if they are external and non-critical.
