Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 50.239.214.145 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.0.0/16 range sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to destination IP 50.239.214.145. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.17.0.0/16) to the target IP 50.239.214.145 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet or compromised hosts within the source subnet.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source hosts for compromise.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures to prevent recurrence.
