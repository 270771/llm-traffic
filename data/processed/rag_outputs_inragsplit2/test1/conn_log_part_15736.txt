Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.22.191.77 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.75.159, 133.247.185.88, 133.247.237.186, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter for traffic destined to 3.22.191.77. Engage upstream providers to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range. Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests. Notify the affected party to prepare for potential service degradation.
