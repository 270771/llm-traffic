Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 69.47.68.228 within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type used here, confirming these are echo requests, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 130.197.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 69.47.68.228. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall. Monitor the target host 69.47.68.228 for service degradation and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised and coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic.
