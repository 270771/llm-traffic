Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting suspicious ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating traffic from this source.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS systems to catch future attempts early.
