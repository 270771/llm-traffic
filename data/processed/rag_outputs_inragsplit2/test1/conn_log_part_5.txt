Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but do not reach the threshold of at least 10 instances from a single source IP to multiple destinations, except for IP 133.16.14.149 which shows multiple ICMP type 8 packets but mostly one per destination, and no clear flood pattern (high volume to a single or few targets).  
- The IP 107.54.37.94 shows multiple ICMP type 8 packets to different destinations in quick succession, but only 6 instances are visible, below the threshold of 10.  
- Other ICMP types (1, 3, 13) are present but are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) packets suggests normal network diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet volume from any single source IP to multiple destinations.  
- Investigate IP 133.16.14.149 and 107.54.37.94 for unusual ICMP activity patterns if volume increases.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for heuristic 20 or other known attack signatures once heuristic context is available.
