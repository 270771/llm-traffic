Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.47.69.34 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.65.158, 133.247.65.28, 133.247.105.207, etc.) all targeting destination IP 69.47.69.34 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 69.47.69.34.
- Notify network operations to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
