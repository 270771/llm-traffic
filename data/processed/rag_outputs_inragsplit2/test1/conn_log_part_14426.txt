Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Only one instance is present, below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP type 3 packet, which typically represents a destination unreachable message.

No heuristic or taxonomy applies here due to lack of data.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 3 messages increase abnormally, as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity.
