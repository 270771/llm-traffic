Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 4 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance per ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types (4 = Source Quench, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not match typical flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP traffic from the same IPs.
