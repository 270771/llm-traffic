Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.152.76.54) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.134.51, 133.247.19.5, 133.247.246.176, etc.) all targeting destination IP 54.152.76.54 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor the target host (54.152.76.54) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if possible.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate potentially compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Enable logging and alerting for further ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS mitigation capabilities.
