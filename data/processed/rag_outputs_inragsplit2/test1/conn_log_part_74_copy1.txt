Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 in the Zeek conn.log snippet (field 11 is 0), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the data. The traffic appears to be sporadic ICMP replies or other ICMP types, not a flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic to confirm it is legitimate (likely Echo Reply).  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to better classify future anomalies.
