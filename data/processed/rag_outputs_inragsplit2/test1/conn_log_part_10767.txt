Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (44.53.133.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic, which can be assigned heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.53.133.97; Destination IPs include 163.252.133.254, 163.252.220.5, 163.252.187.88, 163.252.187.72, 163.252.94.1, and many others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 44.53.133.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict ICMP traffic to only necessary hosts or networks.
