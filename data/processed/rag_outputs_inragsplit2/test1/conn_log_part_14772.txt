Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

No other attack type is evident from this single ICMP entry. Without multiple repeated echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 139.179.133.57 to the destination 203.78.173.45. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the connection state OTH for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
