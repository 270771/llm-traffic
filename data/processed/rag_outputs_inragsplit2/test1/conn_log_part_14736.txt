Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood detection. Here, only two entries have ICMP type 8.
- The requirement is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to consider it a ping flood, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and no such IPs are indicated.
- The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 5, which are not relevant to ping flood detection.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated in the provided data.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or repeated suspicious IPs is recommended as a next step.
