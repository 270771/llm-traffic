Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; none indicate ICMP traffic.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- There are no repeated ICMP type 8 instances (minimum 10 required) or any anomalous source/destination IPs flagged by heuristic 20.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show single TCP or UDP attempts with no flooding or scanning pattern.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ICMP traffic.  
- Enable or review anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to catch potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 matches or other known indicators of ICMP-based attacks.
