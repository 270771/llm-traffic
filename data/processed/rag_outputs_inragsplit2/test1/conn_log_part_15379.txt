Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, further monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and types is recommended to detect any escalation.
