Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the general heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination indicate a ping flood (heuristic 20 is referenced in the instructions as relevant to known anomalous IPs, but none are found here).
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (133.247.157.211, 133.247.157.234, 133.247.157.254, 133.247.79.32, 133.247.39.158, 133.247.151.121, 133.247.51.181, 133.247.17.116, 133.247.79.73, 133.247.185.73, 133.247.45.57, 133.247.45.249, 133.247.17.123, 133.247.79.77) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.193.126.151.
- Monitor the affected host and network for signs of service degradation or denial of service.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from known malicious regions.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
