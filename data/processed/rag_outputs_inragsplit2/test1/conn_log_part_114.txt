Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.30.218.60 from multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.161.37.209, 157.161.233.143, 157.161.195.83, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" as the most likely labels.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor the target host 3.30.218.60 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
