Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single conn.log entry shows an ICMP packet with type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP echo request. Further investigation would require more data points or repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.254. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, reassess for ping flood activity.
