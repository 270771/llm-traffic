Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window (~0.005 seconds). This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: ICMP type must be 8, and at least 10 such instances should be present unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved. Here, both conditions are met (type 8, >10 instances, no heuristic 20 IPs).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.0.186, 133.247.35.4, 133.247.20.223, etc.) targeting destination IP 13.86.47.233 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the victim IP.
- Conduct network segmentation to isolate the victim host and prevent lateral movement.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
- Monitor for collateral effects and adjust firewall policies to maintain availability while blocking attack traffic.
