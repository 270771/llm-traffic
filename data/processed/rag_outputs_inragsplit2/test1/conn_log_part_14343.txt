Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source").
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 13.242.241.56; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for collateral impact on destination IPs and network performance.
- Conduct further investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack at source.
