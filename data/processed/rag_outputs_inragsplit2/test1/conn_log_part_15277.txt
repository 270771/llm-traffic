Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 128, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (source IP 82.26.149.149 to destination 202.194.9.210). This single occurrence does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (128 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the single ICMP Echo Request if it is unusual in the network context, but it does not currently indicate an attack.
