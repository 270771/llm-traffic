Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 2 and 1, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving known suspicious IPs or increased ICMP Echo Requests.
