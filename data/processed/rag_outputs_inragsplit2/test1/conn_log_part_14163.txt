Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.220.233.141 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm the network or hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations within a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; Destination IPs include 163.252.50.1, 163.252.50.2, 163.252.145.254, 163.252.38.198, 163.252.239.41, 163.252.239.175, 163.252.239.179, 163.252.50.30, 163.252.247.142, 163.252.77.1, 163.252.180.92.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP and related addresses.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any hosts impacted by this flood.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IP is from an untrusted region.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
