Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.
