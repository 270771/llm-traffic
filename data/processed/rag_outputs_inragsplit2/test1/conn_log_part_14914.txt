Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) must be 8. In the snippet, there are only 3 entries with ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 114.175.15.85, 210.122.61.236, and 139.179.133.57). This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (1, 3, 13) correspond to echo replies, destination unreachable, and timestamp requests, which are not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 1 (echo reply) is normal in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated unreachable messages that could indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, correlate with these logs for more precise detection.
