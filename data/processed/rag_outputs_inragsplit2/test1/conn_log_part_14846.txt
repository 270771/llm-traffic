Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 could be related to traceroute or routing issues, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.204.255 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
