Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type present in the snippet is type 8 (echo request) in one record, but there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP record shows type 128, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination IP 203.78.173.119 appear repeatedly with ICMP echo requests in future logs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
