Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (as per your instructions: known anomalous src or dst IPs related to ping floods) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs in the 163.21.x.x and 203.65.x.x ranges.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
