Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP echo request (type 8) packets sent to the single destination IP 68.104.133.69 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets targeting one host is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.177.247, 133.228.82.124, 133.228.213.4, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 68.104.133.69.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact on the targeted host.
