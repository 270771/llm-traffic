Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times in the snippet (from source IPs 157.17.55.112, 157.17.106.198, and 157.17.114.57 to destination 161.67.57.135). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which do not qualify as ping flood indicators.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types. The traffic pattern does not match known ping flood heuristics (e.g., heuristic 20) or taxonomy classes.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source(s) to the same destination(s). If the count rises above 10 in a short time window, re-evaluate for ping flood. Additionally, investigate the sources of ICMP type 0 and 11 packets for potential other ICMP-based anomalies.
