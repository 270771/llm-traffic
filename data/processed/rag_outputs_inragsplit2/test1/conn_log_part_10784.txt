Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.233.57, 157.17.238.95, 157.17.191.0, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.179.180.7.
- Monitor the affected host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic if the attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
