Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The only ICMP type value visible is "0" in the 11th field, which does not correspond to type 8.  
- There are only 3 ICMP connection entries from the same source IP (203.65.114.222) to different destinations, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connections are marked as OTH (other) state, which is common for ICMP traffic that does not establish a session.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type values in more detail if raw packet captures are available to confirm the ICMP message types.  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
