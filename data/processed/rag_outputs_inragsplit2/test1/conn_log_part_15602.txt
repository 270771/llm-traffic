Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 3 message typically signals network or host unreachable conditions, which is normal network behavior rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages or other unusual traffic patterns from these IPs could be considered as a next step.
