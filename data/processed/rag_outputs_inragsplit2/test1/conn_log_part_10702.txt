Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to better classify future suspicious traffic.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or scanning activity.
