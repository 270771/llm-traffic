Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 133.228.165.138 and 68.104.133.69. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 203.78.179.25 to 1.248.245.140) is type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The single ICMP echo request is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in bursts exceeding the threshold.  
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, correlate with IP reputation or known attack signatures.
