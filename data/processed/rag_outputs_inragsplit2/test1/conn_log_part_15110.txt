Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.29.238.156 and 13.86.47.233), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context requires assigning a default heuristic and taxonomy: this matches a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 1: ICMP flood detection; taxonomy class: Denial of Service - Network).
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from ranges 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 54.29.238.156 and 13.86.47.233. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
