Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.231, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP packets are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 packets may warrant routine network troubleshooting but do not indicate a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
