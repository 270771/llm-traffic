Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the single destination IP 16.161.126.169 from multiple distinct source IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic number is **20**, which corresponds to suspicious ICMP flood activity.  
- The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack, as ping floods are a classic DoS vector.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 16.161.126.169  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.17.50.10, 157.17.44.116, 157.17.54.136, 157.17.66.100, 157.17.96.86, 157.17.115.147, 157.17.161.111, 157.17.98.16, 157.17.159.54, 157.17.175.226, 157.17.221.217, 157.17.50.31, 157.17.96.201, 157.17.2.198, 157.17.254.17, 157.17.221.242, 157.17.236.111, 157.17.58.74, 157.17.230.129, among others.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 16.161.126.169.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
6. Ensure critical services on 16.161.126.169 have redundancy or failover to mitigate impact.
