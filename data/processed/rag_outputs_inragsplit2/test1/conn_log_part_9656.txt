Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.61.26.217) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) typically classified under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.247.x.x range and one from 61.1.51.193, all targeting destination IP 44.61.26.217 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 44.61.26.217.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16 and 61.1.51.193) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  5. Notify the affected system owners and prepare for potential escalation if service degradation occurs.
