Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types correspond to:  
- Type 1: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  

These are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP error messages (type 1) which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
