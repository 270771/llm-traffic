Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.220.233.141) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria specify at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 are needed to confirm a ping flood, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if 54.220.233.141 is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IP is from an untrusted region.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs if attack traffic persists to coordinate mitigation.
