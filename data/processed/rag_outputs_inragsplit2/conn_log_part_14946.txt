Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection log entry. Further investigation would require more data points or anomaly records to identify potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data for correlation.
