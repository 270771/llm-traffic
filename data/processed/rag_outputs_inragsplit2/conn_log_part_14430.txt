Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional anomalies, this traffic appears benign or normal ICMP probing.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (52.158.11.176) to the destination (163.252.70.132). If counts exceed 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood activity.
