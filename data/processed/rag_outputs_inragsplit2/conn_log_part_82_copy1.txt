Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations.
- Taxonomy class is likely "Denial of Service (DoS)" given the nature of ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.21.3.210, 163.21.24.42, 163.21.222.42, etc.). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source is external and persistent.
