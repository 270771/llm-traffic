Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 3 typically signals network issues or unreachable hosts, not flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be made. To investigate further, monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP within a short time frame and check for any anomaly records indicating suspicious behavior.
