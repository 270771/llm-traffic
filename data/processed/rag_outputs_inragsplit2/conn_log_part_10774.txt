Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance appears once in the snippet (from 133.247.49.34 to 193.20.135.157).  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomaly or heuristic information is available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or related alerts if they appear.
