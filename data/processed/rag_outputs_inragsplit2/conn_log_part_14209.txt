Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 7 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern appears to be multiple hosts pinging a single destination (18.36.162.241), but the volume is insufficient to classify as a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP Echo Requests to the destination IP to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they continue to send frequent pings, as multiple sources targeting one host could indicate reconnaissance or a slow-rate DoS attempt.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out an attack pattern once the count exceeds the threshold or anomalies are detected.
