Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but there is only one instance, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly data or heuristic context is available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs flagged by heuristics, this traffic appears benign.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If volume spikes or anomalies appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
