Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (e.g., heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.38.76, 133.247.30.4, 133.247.54.173, etc.) are flooding the destination 157.187.159.183 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range. Additionally, monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet.
