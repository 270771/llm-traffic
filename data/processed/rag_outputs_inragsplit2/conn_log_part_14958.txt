Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 1 and 2, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable) and 2 (Redirect) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or DoS activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate if these ICMP messages correlate with any network issues or misconfigurations.
