Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the pattern of a ping flood: multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types in these entries are 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.55.222, 133.247.104.206, 133.247.236.238, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 and high volume from many sources to one destination is indicative of a distributed ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.116.11.97.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Monitor the target host 3.116.11.97 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Consider deploying ICMP anomaly detection heuristics to alert on future floods.
