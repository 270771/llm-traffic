Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.250). The other entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 could indicate normal network error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination IP 203.78.173.250 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
