Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows 24 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the single destination IP 3.30.218.60. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern matches a classic ping flood: multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target, overwhelming it.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20 associated with the destination IP 3.30.218.60, categorizing the anomaly as "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which aligns with NetworkScanICMP and specifically ping flood detection.
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks in the provided taxonomy.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.253.210, 133.240.1.240, 133.240.192.221, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 3.30.218.60 for signs of service degradation or denial.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and assess if these IPs are compromised or spoofed.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
  5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic is volumetric and beyond local mitigation capabilities.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "NetworkScanICMP," requiring urgent mitigation to protect the targeted host.
