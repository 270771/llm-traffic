Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records or types are shown.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which matches a SYN flood pattern, not a ping flood.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.
- No heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies or ICMP type 8 packets are detected.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on 89.3.89.164:8080 further by reviewing connection attempts and firewall logs.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods in the future.
