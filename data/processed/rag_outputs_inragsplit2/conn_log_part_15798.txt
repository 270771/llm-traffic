Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.74.6, 163.252.18.118, 163.252.129.78, 163.252.178.43, 163.252.186.110, 163.252.181.225, 163.252.234.129, 163.252.8.52, 163.252.129.106, 163.252.8.45, 163.252.8.78, 163.252.234.64, 163.252.181.89, 163.252.181.136, 163.252.129.83, 163.252.234.10, 163.252.133.254, 163.252.150.98, 163.252.164.1, 163.252.235.177.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP Echo Requests from this IP or similar patterns from other sources.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Notify affected destination IP owners if internal to your network or coordinate with upstream providers if external.
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network monitoring tools to alert on similar future events.
6. Review and update incident response playbooks to include rapid containment of ICMP flood attacks.
