Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 50.239.214.145 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.14.73, 157.17.172.167, 157.17.237.183, etc.) targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 50.239.214.145 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
  5. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
