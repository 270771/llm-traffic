Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity (ICMP type 11). Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific attack classification applies here.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
