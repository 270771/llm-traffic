Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack pattern. Assigning heuristic 20 (based on the instruction referencing known anomalous IPs) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is connectionless.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation on the destination IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other hosts targeted by this source.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source IP and consider upstream provider notification or blacklisting.
