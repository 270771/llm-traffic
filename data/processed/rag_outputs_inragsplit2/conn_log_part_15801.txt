Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack. Assigning heuristic number 20 (commonly used for volumetric ICMP floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" is appropriate.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for collateral impact on destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Engage incident response to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
