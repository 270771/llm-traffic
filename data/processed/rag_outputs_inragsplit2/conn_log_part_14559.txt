Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), but none mention heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the many TCP connections showing SYN flags (S0) but no ICMP traffic.  
- Therefore, the traffic matches a SYN flood or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm if any firewall or IDS rules are triggered by these SYN anomalies and adjust thresholds accordingly.
