Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x and 203.78.x.x ranges. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 163.171.168.73 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  3. Monitor network for further ICMP flood attempts and implement anomaly-based detection rules.
  4. Notify network operations and potentially affected parties to prepare for service degradation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if attack persists.
