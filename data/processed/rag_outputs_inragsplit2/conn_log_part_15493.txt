Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown in the snippet, but the Zeek conn.log entries with ICMP protocol and type 8 (Echo Request) are present only 6 times from source IP 13.208.10.201 to various destination IPs. This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to qualify as a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types other than 8 (e.g., type 11 or 0), which do not count toward ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears to be normal echo requests and other ICMP messages without volumetric flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 13.208.10.201 for unusual ICMP activity if it persists or increases.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context data to improve detection accuracy.
