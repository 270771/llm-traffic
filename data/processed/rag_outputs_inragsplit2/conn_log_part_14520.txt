Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and other suspicious TCP traffic.  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies related to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) as they indicate potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Review network logs for ICMP traffic separately to confirm no ping flood attempts are occurring.  
- Monitor source IPs such as 185.58.127.74 and 89.3.89.164 flagged in anomalies for further suspicious behavior.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10) and TCP heavy hitter activity (heuristic 999).
