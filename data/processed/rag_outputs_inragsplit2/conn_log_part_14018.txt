Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 35.173.100.241 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 157.17.29.254, 133.247.180.3) flooding the destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor and block further traffic from suspicious source IPs (133.247.0.0/16 subnet and others identified).
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP ranges.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood thresholds and anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and harden network infrastructure to prevent amplification and ensure availability of the targeted host 35.173.100.241.
