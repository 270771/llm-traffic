Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here due to the volume and type of ICMP traffic.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct further investigation on the source IP to determine if it is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify upstream providers if the attack persists to coordinate broader mitigation.
