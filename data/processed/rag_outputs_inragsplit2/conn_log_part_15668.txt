Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field (field 11), which is `11` in both entries. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded," not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries total, both with type 11, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports matching heuristic 20 are present.
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate other ICMP activity such as traceroute or network issues (ICMP type 11 is often related to TTL expiration).

No heuristic or taxonomy from anomaly CSV applies here due to lack of data.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs (202.194.17.61 and 133.247.252.81) for unusual ICMP type 11 activity if it persists or increases.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
- Collect more detailed logs or anomaly data to correlate with other suspicious activity.
