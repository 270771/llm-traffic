Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the log snippet are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (139.179.133.57 â†’ 203.78.173.106), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) may suggest normal network diagnostic or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP type 8 packets in larger volumes.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
