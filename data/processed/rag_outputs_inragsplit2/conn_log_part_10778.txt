Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.47.69.34) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.140.32, 133.247.61.168, 133.247.76.187, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.47.69.34 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host (69.47.69.34) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within your network or upstream providers.
