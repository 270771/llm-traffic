Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the Echo Request used in ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but this behavior aligns with a classic ping flood attack (heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP floods).
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and destination IP 52.236.221.123; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Conduct traffic filtering to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges. Monitor for further volumetric anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Additionally, verify the target hostâ€™s availability and performance impact, and prepare for potential escalation to upstream providers if attack volume increases.
