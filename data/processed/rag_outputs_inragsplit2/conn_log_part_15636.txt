Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~same timestamp). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where a host overwhelms multiple targets with echo requests.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.82.223, 163.252.81.196, 163.252.27.227, 163.252.27.231, 163.252.202.195, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify network operations to check for any service degradation on the targeted destination IPs.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS for early detection of similar attacks.
