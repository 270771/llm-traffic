Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly 0 or 8, but the key criterion is that ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood detection.  
- There are multiple entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP 16.160.152.89, but the total count of such entries is fewer than 10 (only about 8 distinct entries with type 8 to that IP).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known malicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source IP, but rather multiple distinct source IPs sending single ICMP type 8 packets, which could be normal network scanning or benign activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume from single or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unknown or suspicious in other logs.  
- Correlate with other network logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be applied at this time.
