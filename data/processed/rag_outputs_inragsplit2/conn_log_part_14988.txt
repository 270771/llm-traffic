Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 124.190.25.100 to 133.102.213.152 and from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.228). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (type 3) are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ping flood activity.
