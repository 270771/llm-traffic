Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 11 (Time Exceeded) and only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 indicates traceroute or TTL expiration activity, not a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could focus on the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 packets to verify if there is unusual traceroute or network scanning activity, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no heuristics or taxonomy data are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Next steps: monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic and correlate with other logs to detect potential flooding or reconnaissance.
