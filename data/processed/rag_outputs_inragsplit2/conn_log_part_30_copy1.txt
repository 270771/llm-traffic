Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175. This volume and pattern of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and categorizes the anomaly as "ntscICecrqICecrprp," a NetworkScanICMP class consistent with ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.230.50, 133.240.230.152, 133.240.220.0, etc.) are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 54.239.183.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other network logs to detect potential coordinated attacks.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP type 8 floods.
  5. If the destination IP is a critical asset, isolate it temporarily to prevent service disruption.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, supported by both the log data and anomaly records.
