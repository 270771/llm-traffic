Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (50.239.214.145) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one IP in rapid succession.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 50.239.214.145; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 50.239.214.145.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact on the target host and prepare mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
