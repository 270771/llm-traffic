Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The only anomaly present (heuristic 10) relates to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN floods, not ICMP ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attack detection, which matches the anomaly record found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by reviewing TCP SYN packet rates and sources.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks not visible in the current logs.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests to catch ping floods early.
