Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code field "11" in the source port column, not type 8 (Echo Request). There is only one instance of ICMP traffic, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection log entry. The ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data and anomaly records for comprehensive analysis.
