Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one packet is logged. Since the ICMP type is not indicated as 8 (echo request), and there are fewer than 10 such instances, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), which does not indicate a flood pattern.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection record. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (203.78.182.16) or to the same destination IP (93.89.161.148) to detect potential future ping floods.
