Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- All relevant ICMP entries have type 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood.
- The volume of ICMP type 8 packets (well above 10) from multiple source IPs to the same destination IP strongly indicates a coordinated ping flood.
- No anomaly records explicitly reference heuristic 20 or related taxonomy, so by default, this matches a generic ping flood heuristic (assign heuristic 20) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.221.242, 157.17.50.10, 157.17.96.201) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (no ports).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger distributed attack.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
