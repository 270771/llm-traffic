Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 packets to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
