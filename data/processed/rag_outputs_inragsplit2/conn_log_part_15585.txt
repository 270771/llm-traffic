Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are flooding destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 16.160.152.89.
- Monitor the victim host (16.160.152.89) for service degradation and consider isolating it from the network if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims and sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Notify upstream providers and coordinate for traffic filtering if attack volume escalates.
