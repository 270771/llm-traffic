Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) related to TCP port 8080, not ICMP traffic.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.
- The traffic patterns show single connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), typical of scanning or SYN flood attempts, but no ICMP flooding.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by monitoring source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect any emerging ping flood attacks.
