Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.159.39, 157.17.251.130, 130.197.163.33) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.175.248.229 and 69.46.227.121), indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame strongly match known ping flood attack patterns.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting one or few destinations) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 157.17.x.x and 130.197.x.x ranges, plus 3.231.100.178.
- Destinations: Primarily 52.175.248.229 and 69.46.227.121.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic if the volume escalates.
- Conduct a forensic review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if business operations allow.
