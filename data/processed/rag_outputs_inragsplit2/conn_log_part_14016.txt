Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting two main destination IPs: 35.173.100.241 and 34.25.86.31.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to the same destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges.
  - Destinations: 35.173.100.241 and 34.25.86.31.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
4. Conduct source IP reputation checks and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
6. Review and harden network perimeter defenses against ICMP-based DoS attacks.
