Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times in the snippet (lines with ICMP type 8). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- One ICMP packet with type 1 (Echo Reply) is present, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and replies without volumetric flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the source or destination IPs become flagged in future anomaly reports or match known heuristics.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of flooding emerges over time.
