Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, no further investigation is warranted specifically for ping floods.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets emerges.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other security systems or threat intelligence feeds.
