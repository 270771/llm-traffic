Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, the hallmark of ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" apply.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 65.234.113.148 are flooding the destination IP 34.25.134.27. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets. Notify the network operations team to investigate and potentially block offending IPs upstream. Monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
