Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 15.130.145.131 and 54.193.88.34 to 202.194.58.107). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries either have different types or only single occurrences.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP Echo Requests could be normal network diagnostics or low-volume scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IP.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other threat intelligence sources.
