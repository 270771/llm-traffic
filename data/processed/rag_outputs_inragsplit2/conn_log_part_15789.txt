Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- All these connections have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from a single source.
- Taxonomy class is likely "Denial of Service" (DoS) due to the nature of ICMP flood attacks overwhelming network resources.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.254.193, 163.252.79.221, 163.252.246.160, 163.252.246.147, 163.252.188.88, 163.252.165.1, 163.252.174.125, 163.252.174.202, 163.252.106.62, 163.252.220.5, 163.252.254.55, 163.252.188.49, 163.252.37.241, 163.252.127.169, 163.252.25.253, 163.252.81.203, 163.252.81.198, 163.252.127.41, 163.252.47.239, 163.252.27.95.
- Ports are ICMP type 8 (no ports in ICMP, but type field is relevant).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP floods or other DoS attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IP is from an untrusted or suspicious region.
