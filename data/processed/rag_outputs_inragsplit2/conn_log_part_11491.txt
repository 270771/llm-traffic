Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting a single destination, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.164.200, 133.228.185.247, 133.228.249.55, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 3.83.92.175 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.
  5. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
