Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 within a very short time window (~1641099665 seconds). This pattern of multiple ICMP type 8 packets flooding a single target is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from multiple sources targeting a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.28.143, 133.247.39.76, 133.247.184.195, etc.) are flooding destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 157.187.159.183.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood (133.247.28.143, 133.247.39.76, etc.).
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact on the targeted host.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
