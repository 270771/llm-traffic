Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.22.191.77, which is a classic indicator of a ping flood attack pattern.
- The ICMP type 8 presence in multiple rapid connections from many different source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range) to a single destination IP strongly suggests an ICMP Echo Request flood.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches the heuristic that requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to confirm a ping flood.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions), which relates to known anomalous source or destination IPs involved in ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from 133.247.0.0/16 subnet, targeting destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the Echo Request.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 3.22.191.77 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block the malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to specifically detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
