Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one host rapidly.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and destination IP 16.161.126.169. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity.
  5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if business operations allow.
