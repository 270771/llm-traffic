Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3, 10, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided logs, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.
- The ICMP types seen (3 = Destination Unreachable, 10 = Router Advertisement, 0 = Echo Reply) do not indicate a ping flood or similar volumetric ICMP attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed based on this data. However, monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume and checking for heuristic 20 (if available) in future logs is recommended to detect potential ping floods.
