Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.127.10, 163.252.127.1, 163.252.192.71, 163.252.145.155, 163.252.81.198, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
