Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows 10 distinct ICMP connections all with type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the same destination IP 34.25.86.31 within a very short time frame. This matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to a single destination strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests indicating a ping flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source IPs are 157.17.254.8, 157.17.254.17, 157.17.173.109, 157.17.173.126, 157.17.173.15, 157.17.229.62, 157.17.114.109, 157.17.254.3, 157.17.229.193, 157.17.229.4; Destination IP is 34.25.86.31; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/protocol.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 34.25.86.31 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Conduct a network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts. Consider blacklisting or blocking the identified source IPs if confirmed malicious. Alert the incident response team to monitor for further DoS activity and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic shaping or upstream filtering with the ISP.
