Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP, indicating a distributed flood rather than a single host, increasing the attack's impact.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting distributed ICMP floods) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 52.236.221.123; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
