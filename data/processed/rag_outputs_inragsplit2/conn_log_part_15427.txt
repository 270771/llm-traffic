Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 0, 3, 11, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise or indicate known suspicious IPs related to heuristic 20.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed correspond to:  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  

These are normal ICMP control messages and do not indicate flooding or denial-of-service behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if unusual volumes are detected over a longer period, as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Enable logging and monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
