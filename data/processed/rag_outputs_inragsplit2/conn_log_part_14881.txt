Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1, 3, or 8. However, the majority of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are only 2 instances (lines with src IPs 139.179.133.57 and 133.247.49.34). This is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (1 and 3) correspond to destination unreachable and echo reply or other control messages, not ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show repeated or high-volume ICMP echo requests from a single source to a destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 1 (host unreachable) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or transient errors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 1 messages if network connectivity issues are suspected.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
