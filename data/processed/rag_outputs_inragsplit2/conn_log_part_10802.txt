Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is:
  - ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request).
  - At least 10 instances of such packets targeting the same destination.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to resource exhaustion via ICMP flooding.
- Involved IPs:
  - Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.247.35.164, 133.247.143.224, 133.247.31.190, etc.)
  - Destination IP: 35.183.65.24
  - Ports: ICMP does not use ports; indicated as 0 in logs.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.183.65.24.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network and host performance metrics on 35.183.65.24 for signs of degradation or service impact.
5. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement and consider blacklisting or further forensic analysis.
6. Inform incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
