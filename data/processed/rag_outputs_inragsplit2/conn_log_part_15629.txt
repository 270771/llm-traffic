Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; Destination IPs include 163.252.4.131, 163.252.42.86, 163.252.176.117, 163.252.42.89, 163.252.99.215, 163.252.248.143, 163.252.238.75, 163.252.125.34, 163.252.3.62, 163.252.176.92, 163.252.176.125, 163.252.188.127, 163.252.99.242, 163.252.238.62, 163.252.99.227.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.221.141.21 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
- Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and alerts to detect and mitigate future ping flood attempts proactively.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
