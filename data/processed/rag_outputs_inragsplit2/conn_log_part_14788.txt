Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- The source IP 35.119.5.36 is sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~same timestamp), consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.119.5.36; Destination IPs include 163.252.249.65, 163.252.249.177, 163.252.249.235, 163.252.60.6, 163.252.140.92, 163.252.237.40, 163.252.234.174, 163.252.58.193, 163.252.140.6, 163.252.237.124, 163.252.176.92, 163.252.237.235, 163.252.245.253, 163.252.240.47, 163.252.240.125, 163.252.78.237, 163.252.140.91, 163.252.245.247, 163.252.164.203.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.119.5.36 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Investigate the source host 35.119.5.36 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the attack persists.
