Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (~0.005 seconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single host) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs:  
  - Destination: 157.187.159.183 (target of the flood)  
  - Sources: 133.247.15.195, 133.247.182.29, 133.247.189.36, 133.247.72.108, 133.247.96.230, 133.247.182.225, 133.247.38.5, 133.247.14.254, 133.247.106.1, 133.247.191.1, 133.247.182.88, 133.247.182.135  
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet, and coordinate with upstream providers or CERT teams for mitigation.
