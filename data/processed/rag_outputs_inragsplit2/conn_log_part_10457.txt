Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets, this single ICMP type 11 instance does not match ping flood criteria. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No other attack is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify any emerging patterns.
