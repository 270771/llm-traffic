Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 35.130.188.37 to destination 203.78.190.60, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or related to other issues but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceed the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.130.188.37 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
