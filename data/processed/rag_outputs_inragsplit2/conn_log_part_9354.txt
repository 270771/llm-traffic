Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances originating from a single source IP (54.254.250.38) targeting many different destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to multiple targets matches the classic signature of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- The involved IP address is 54.254.250.38 (source) flooding ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.0.0/16 range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted subnet 163.252.0.0/16.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack at source.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
