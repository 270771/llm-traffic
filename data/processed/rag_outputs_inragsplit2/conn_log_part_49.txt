Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 143.224.65.254 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.210.95.x range within a very short time frame. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to multiple hosts matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- The anomaly CSV identifies a suspicious connection from 133.16.14.149 related to ICMP errors under heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood detection. Although this IP is not the main source in the bulk of the log, heuristic 20 confirms the taxonomy class "icmp_error" related to ping flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.65.254 flooding ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to destination IPs 163.210.95.16, 163.210.95.17, 163.210.95.18, 163.210.95.19, 163.210.95.21, 163.210.95.24, 163.210.95.25, 163.210.95.26, 163.210.95.27, 163.210.95.28, 163.210.95.29, 163.210.95.30, 163.210.95.31, 163.210.95.57, 163.210.95.58, 163.210.95.59, 163.210.95.60, 163.210.95.61, 163.210.95.62, 163.210.95.63.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets confirm the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 143.224.65.254 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network devices and hosts in the 163.210.95.0/24 subnet for signs of service degradation or outages.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP 143.224.65.254 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle malicious ICMP traffic if the attack volume escalates.

This attack aligns with heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error" indicating a denial-of-service attempt via ICMP flooding.
