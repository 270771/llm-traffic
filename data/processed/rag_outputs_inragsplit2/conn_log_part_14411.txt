Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.115.224.159) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.115.224.159 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.115.224.159.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for escalation or lateral movement.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 3.115.224.159.
