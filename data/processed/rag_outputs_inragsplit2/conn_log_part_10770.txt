Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 72.63.32.62, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for related anomalies.
