Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP 54.184.243.206 in a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the echo request used in ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 54.184.243.206; ICMP protocol, type 8 (echo request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the conn.log shows ICMP traffic with no ports.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) targeting 54.184.243.206.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests matching this pattern.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking sources.
4. Conduct a forensic investigation to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary use cases only.
