Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the conn.log snippet shows only two entries with ICMP type codes 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for ping floods and there are fewer than 10 instances of type 8, the traffic does not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors that might indicate other network issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
