Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 could be related to traceroute or TTL expiry, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify patterns over time.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in source/destination IPs if they appear.
