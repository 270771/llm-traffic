Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from a single source IP (3.231.100.178) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic signature of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records were found, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.231.100.178; Destination IPs include 163.252.83.24, 163.252.145.254, 163.252.28.62, 163.252.10.201, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood relevance.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.231.100.178 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting on internal routers to mitigate future floods.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
