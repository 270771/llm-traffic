Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown in the snippet, but the protocol is ICMP (proto 11). The ICMP type for echo request (ping) is 8, which is not indicated here.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack indicators.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and no repeated or high-volume ICMP echo requests are evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in detail if available to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP echo requests from or to these IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs or anomaly data to detect potential low-volume or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
