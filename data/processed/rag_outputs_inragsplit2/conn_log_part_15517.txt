Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but indicates a possible network issue or scanning activity related to unreachable destinations. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific attack classification can be assigned.

Further investigation should focus on monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Also, review network device logs for ICMP type 3 messages to understand the cause of unreachable destinations.
