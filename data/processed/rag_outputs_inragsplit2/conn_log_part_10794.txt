Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8 to indicate echo requests used in ping floods. In the provided conn.log snippet, only a few entries show ICMP type 8, and there are fewer than 10 such instances. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or other heuristics. The traffic does not show the volume or pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated requests from the same source IPs. Investigate if any of the involved IPs (e.g., 157.17.50.157, 157.17.58.186, 157.17.39.11, 157.17.39.204) show suspicious behavior in other logs or alerts.
