Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.193.126.151 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.193.126.151; Destination IPs include 133.251.127.248, 133.251.112.237, 133.251.127.224, 133.251.113.41, 133.251.127.191, 133.251.115.0, 133.251.113.64, 133.251.126.16, 133.251.115.250, 133.251.112.101, 133.251.114.228.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.193.126.151 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or targeted by the attack.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
