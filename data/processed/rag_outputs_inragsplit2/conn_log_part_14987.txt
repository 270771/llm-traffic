Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is consistently 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping). However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the pattern escalates to a ping flood.  
- Investigate the sources 139.179.133.57 and 1.65.180.129 if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.
