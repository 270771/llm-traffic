Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with any network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies or heuristic matches if they arise.
