Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. A ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
