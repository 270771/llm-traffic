Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request).  
- The snippet shows only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 11, type 0) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or other heuristics.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests and other ICMP messages without volumetric flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets (133.247.30.99, 133.247.49.34) for any unusual behavior or reputation issues.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs are involved in other suspicious activities.
