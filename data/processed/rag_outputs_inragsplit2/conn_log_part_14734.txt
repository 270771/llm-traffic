Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping), but there are only 2 ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry has ICMP type 128, which is not type 8, so it does not contribute to a ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entry shows a single echo request, and the second is a different ICMP type, possibly router advertisement or neighbor solicitation, but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data become available that might indicate suspicious behavior.  
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become known, re-evaluate with that context.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
