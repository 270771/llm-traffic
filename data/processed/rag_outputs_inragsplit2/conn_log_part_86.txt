Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of either 3 or 11, none have type 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are not indicative of ping floods but may relate to network troubleshooting or other issues.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. However, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages could warrant investigation into possible network misconfigurations or scanning activity.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual behavior given its repeated involvement.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts unrelated to ping floods.
