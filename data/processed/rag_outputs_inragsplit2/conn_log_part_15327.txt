Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, ICMP type 8 appears only 3 times (lines with src IPs 130.197.157.16 and 130.197.190.209 sending to 54.16.160.215, and 61.148.107.160 to 133.102.23.97).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (such as heuristic 20) are present to override this threshold.  
- No anomaly records are found in the CSV to suggest suspicious IPs or ports related to this traffic.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity or alerts in other logs.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect possible denial-of-service symptoms.
