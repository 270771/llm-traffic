Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Additionally, there are not at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations.

No immediate attack is detected. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
