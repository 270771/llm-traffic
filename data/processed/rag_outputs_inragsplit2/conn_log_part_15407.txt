Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets indicating flooding behavior. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious activity.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP attack heuristics.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If multiple such packets appear (â‰¥10), re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate any ICMP type 3 messages if they increase significantly, as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity.
