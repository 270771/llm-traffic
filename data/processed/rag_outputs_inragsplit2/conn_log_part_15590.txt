Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs including 133.228.27.185, 133.228.140.118, 133.228.140.225, 192.179.223.198, 133.228.188.6, 133.228.179.194, 192.179.222.38, 133.228.187.26, 133.228.76.222, 133.228.191.249, 133.228.9.232, 133.228.119.198, 133.228.255.245, 133.228.184.55, 133.228.186.247, 133.228.186.249, 133.228.57.115, 133.228.232.1, 133.228.174.0, 133.228.127.253, 133.228.232.6; destination IP is 16.160.152.89; ICMP does not use ports.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 16.160.152.89 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to drop or limit ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious external sources.
