Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `1` (ICMP code), not `8` (Echo Request), which is required for identifying ping floods.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, both with type 1, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if more extensive logs show ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
