Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (ICMP code 0) from source IP 61.1.51.193 to destination 15.185.99.42, but the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. Given the lack of multiple ICMP Echo Requests and no known suspicious IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple such packets appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
