Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235) from multiple source IPs, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Monitor the targeted IPs for service degradation and consider temporarily blacklisting the attacking source IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts participating in the attack and isolate them.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
