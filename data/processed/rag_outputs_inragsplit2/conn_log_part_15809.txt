Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types present in the log snippet are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, and no indication of repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 0 corresponds to Echo Reply, which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, especially repeated Echo Requests from a single source.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP type 8 with counts exceeding 10 or matching heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
