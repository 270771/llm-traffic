Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP records, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network or host unreachable errors, which are normal network control messages rather than attack traffic.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors that might indicate network issues or other attack vectors.
