Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.179.203, 133.247.34.249, 133.247.179.195, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.193.126.151.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent attacking IPs.
5. Alert the affected system administrators to prepare for potential service degradation or outages.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack as per standard detection heuristics.
