Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be type 8 (Echo Request). In the provided logs, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (last line), and it is a single instance.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 3) indicate different ICMP messages such as Destination Unreachable, not related to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The majority of ICMP traffic appears to be normal or unrelated control messages.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.65.114.222.
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet from 54.188.203.211 to 203.65.103.15 for legitimacy.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
