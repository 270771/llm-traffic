Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs including 163.21.65.53, 163.21.211.221, 133.250.64.29, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies on critical infrastructure to mitigate impact.
