Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 traffic (from 203.78.177.156 to 67.133.135.249), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without further evidence or heuristic context, no immediate security incident is detected.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
