Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) entries. The only ICMP-related entries have protocol number 17 (UDP) or 6 (TCP), and no ICMP type field indicating type 8 is present.  
- The heuristic for ping flood (heuristic 20) requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets unless anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. Neither condition is met here.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which is TCP SYN flood related, not ICMP ping flood.  
- The taxonomy class for heuristic 10 is "ptmp" (partial TCP flood), indicating a SYN attack, not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly with source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further for potential SYN flood or TCP-based DoS attack, as indicated by heuristic 10.  
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) traffic spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Confirm if any other ICMP types or unusual UDP/TCP traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other attack vectors.
