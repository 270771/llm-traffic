Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8, 0, and 11. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 222.88.115.42 to 133.102.35.50) and one instance of type 0 (Echo Reply) from 130.197.147.191 to 3.215.122.104. The count of ICMP type 8 packets is well below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (0 and 11) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated OTH (other) connection states.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
