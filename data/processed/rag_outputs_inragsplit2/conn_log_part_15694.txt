Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values 11, 3, and 11 respectively, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only three ICMP connections logged, far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or other anomaly indicators, no further investigation into ping floods is warranted.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Collect more detailed ICMP packet-level data to detect potential flooding.
- Investigate if heuristic 20 or other heuristics become relevant once anomaly data is available.
