Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) or another non-type 8 ICMP message (since the ICMP type field is not explicitly 8), and only one instance is present. There are no multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single OTH (other) connection state with ICMP traffic. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple ICMP Echo Requests appear (â‰¥10), re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs for accurate detection.
