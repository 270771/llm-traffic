Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.166.249.180. This matches the classic pattern of a ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) due to the volume and distribution of source IPs targeting one destination with ICMP type 8.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.162.62, 133.247.169.131, 133.247.80.175, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.166.249.180 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 54.166.249.180.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
  4. Notify the upstream ISP or hosting provider of the attack source IPs for possible mitigation.
  5. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
