Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), a necessary condition for ping flood detection.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as port scans or TCP floods, as the protocol is ICMP and the connection state is OTH (other), indicating no established TCP connection.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- If more than 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination appear, re-evaluate for ping flood using heuristic 20 (if available) or similar heuristics related to ICMP flood detection.
