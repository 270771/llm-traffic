Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show only 1 instance each of ICMP type 8 (echo request) from source IP 203.65.114.222 to two different destination IPs.  
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present.  
- Both entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code 11 in the 4th field, not type 8, which is required for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present. No further investigation is required based on this data alone. If additional logs show increased ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs, reevaluation would be warranted.
