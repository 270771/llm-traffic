Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No known heuristics or taxonomy apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
