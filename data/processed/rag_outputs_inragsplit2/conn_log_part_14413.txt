Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.115.224.159, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests from various source IPs flooding one target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x and 52.158.x.x ranges, all targeting destination IP 3.115.224.159 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.115.224.159.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a forensic review of the targeted host for any signs of compromise or service degradation.
