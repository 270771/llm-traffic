Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. Here, there are only 3 instances with ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.201 and 203.78.173.203, and from 51.121.111.183 to 133.102.229.107).
- The total count of ICMP type 8 instances is 3, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or unrelated errors.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to see if the count exceeds 10 within a short time window.
- Investigate the source IPs 139.179.133.57 and 51.121.111.183 if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests.
- Collect more data or anomaly context to better classify any suspicious activity.
