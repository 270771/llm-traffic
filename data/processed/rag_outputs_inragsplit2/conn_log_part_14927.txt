Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The majority of ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping) packets.
- There are more than 10 instances (at least 13) of ICMP type 8 directed at the same destination IP 3.116.11.97 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession targeting a single destination.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP protocol (port fields are not applicable for ICMP).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 3.116.11.97 for service degradation or availability issues.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of similar ICMP floods.
- If possible, engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Log and alert on continued ICMP echo request surges to enable rapid incident response.

Heuristic and taxonomy assignment:
- Heuristic: ICMP Echo Request Flood (commonly heuristic #20 in many taxonomies).
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
