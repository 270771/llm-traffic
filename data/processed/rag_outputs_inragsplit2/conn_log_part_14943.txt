Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood detection. Here, only two entries have ICMP type 8.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly matches, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 for unusual ICMP activity if it persists or escalates.
