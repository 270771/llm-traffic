Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.33.149.154, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and multiplicity of unique source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.145.56, 133.247.20.47, 133.247.145.194, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.33.149.154 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.33.149.154.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for broader attack patterns.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
