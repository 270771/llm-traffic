Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 203.78.187.167 to 213.144.37.254, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 13 (Timestamp Request), which does not qualify as a ping flood since only type 8 is relevant.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if the source IPs have any history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.
