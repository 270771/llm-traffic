Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic signature of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to overwhelming ICMP Echo Requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.96.174, 133.247.0.209, 133.247.168.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 35.183.65.24.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
