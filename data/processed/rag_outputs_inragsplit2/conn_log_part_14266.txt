Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.34.186) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed flood rather than a single host, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 35.127.34.186; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor and log further ICMP traffic to detect escalation or changes in attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if attack volume increases.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
