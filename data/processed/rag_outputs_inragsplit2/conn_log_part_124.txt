Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests to degrade network performance.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" based on standard ping flood detection criteria.
- Involved IP: Source IP 124.121.97.181 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.21.199.207, 163.21.3.252, 133.118.139.251, 203.65.114.248, etc.). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for signs of congestion or packet loss on affected subnets.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential collateral impact.
