Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are sending ICMP type 8 packets to two main destination IPs: 44.50.62.61 and 34.44.165.118.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of flooding ICMP Echo Requests.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; targets 44.50.62.61 and 34.44.165.118; ICMP type 8, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the affected destination IPs (44.50.62.61 and 34.44.165.118) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Prepare incident response to restore normal network operations and communicate with affected stakeholders.
