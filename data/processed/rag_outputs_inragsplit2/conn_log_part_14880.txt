Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only one ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request) with a count of 1 instance (first log line).
- The other ICMP entries either have no type 8 or have missing type fields.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not present here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume.
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
