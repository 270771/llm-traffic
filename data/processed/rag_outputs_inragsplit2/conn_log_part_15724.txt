Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the data to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection termination but is not sufficient evidence of an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP type 8 with high frequency.
