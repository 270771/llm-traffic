Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.115.224.159 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 3.115.224.159 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 3.115.224.159 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
  4. Conduct a forensic review of source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures for this pattern to alert on future occurrences.
