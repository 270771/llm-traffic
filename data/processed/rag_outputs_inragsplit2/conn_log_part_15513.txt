Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets may be related to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in a broader log timeframe to rule out slow or distributed ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in source/destination IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
