Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.237.221.62) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (157.17.151.193, 157.17.231.254, 157.17.191.234, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.237.221.62.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare to isolate it if the attack escalates.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or mitigate traffic from the attacking IP range.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
