Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type present, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of sources targeting one destination strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting distributed ICMP flood attacks) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP 161.67.57.135; ICMP protocol, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic if possible.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automate future responses.
