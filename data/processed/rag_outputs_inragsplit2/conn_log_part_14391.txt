Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to TCP port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs flagged under heuristic 20. Neither condition is met here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm or rule out any ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated failed connection attempts that could indicate evolving attack patterns.
