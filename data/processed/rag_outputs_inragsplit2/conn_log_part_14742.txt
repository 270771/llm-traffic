Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type observed in the logs is 11 (Time Exceeded) and 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 and 0 packets could be normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies or heuristic matches.  
- Investigate if the IPs involved have any history of suspicious activity in other datasets.
