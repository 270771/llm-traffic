Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping floods.  
- However, there are only 7 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known threats or match heuristic 20.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or other anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these source IPs have prior suspicious activity or appear in threat intelligence feeds.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
