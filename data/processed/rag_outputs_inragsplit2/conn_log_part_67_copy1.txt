Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 in the Zeek conn.log snippet (the 4th field after source IP is always 11 or 3, but the ICMP type field is the 7th field which is `icmp` protocol, and the ICMP type itself is not explicitly shown as 8 in any record). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these are not ping requests but likely Echo Replies or other ICMP types.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (none actually), so the threshold for ping flood detection is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP traffic or possibly unrelated ICMP messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the exact ICMP type values if available in more detailed logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.65.114.222 to multiple destinations, which could indicate scanning or flooding.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once heuristic context is available.
