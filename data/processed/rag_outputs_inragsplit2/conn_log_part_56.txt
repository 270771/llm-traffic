Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. Counting these entries, there are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from 133.16.14.149, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP flooding anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; multiple destination IPs including 104.76.138.4, 23.238.7.252, 2.212.163.4, 23.77.161.2, 104.104.255.250, 104.119.102.1, 23.87.140.7, 104.93.164.250, 23.227.209.251, 104.125.253.247.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network devices for abnormal ICMP traffic volume and alert on spikes from this or other IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to identify if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Implement ICMP traffic filtering policies to restrict unnecessary ICMP Echo Requests within the network.
5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include rapid mitigation steps for ICMP-based DoS attacks.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy classification.
