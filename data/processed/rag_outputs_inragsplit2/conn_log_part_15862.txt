Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.228.4.24, originating from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination from multiple sources, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 59.41.190.221) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are internal or under your control.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to detect possible amplification or follow-up attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact and mitigation steps.
