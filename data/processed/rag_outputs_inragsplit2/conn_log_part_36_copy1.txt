Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting a single destination IP 69.8.91.205 from multiple source IPs within the 133.227.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood, which matches the anomaly taxonomy class "NetworkScanICMP" (prefix "ntscIC") seen in the anomaly CSV. Although the anomaly CSV record references a different IP, the heuristic 20 is the most relevant here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.227.22.5, 133.227.115.19, 133.227.219.162, etc.) are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 69.8.91.205. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.227.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 69.8.91.205 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.
  4. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the "NetworkScanICMP" taxonomy class.
