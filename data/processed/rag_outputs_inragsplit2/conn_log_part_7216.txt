Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 50.239.214.145, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelming a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood.
- The volume of ICMP echo requests (more than 10) from multiple source IPs to the same destination IP strongly indicates a coordinated ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.29.190, 157.17.141.126, 157.17.125.125, etc.) targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 is critical.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 50.239.214.145.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor the target host and network for signs of service degradation or outages.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP echo replies on the target host to mitigate impact.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
