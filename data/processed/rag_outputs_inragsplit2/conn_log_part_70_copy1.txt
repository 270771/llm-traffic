Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0, 3, or 11, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, failing the threshold of at least 10 instances for a ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity or other protocols.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
