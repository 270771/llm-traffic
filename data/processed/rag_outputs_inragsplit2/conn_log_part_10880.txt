Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.42.116.124 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations within a short time frame.
- The involved IP address is the source 52.42.116.124 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the echo request nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation or network congestion on affected destination IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected parties and update incident response documentation accordingly.
