Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this fits heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.228.161.194, 133.228.168.61, 133.228.168.57, etc.) flooding destination 3.83.92.175. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used, no ports are relevant for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
