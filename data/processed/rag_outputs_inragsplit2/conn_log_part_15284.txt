Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 1 (ICMP type field is 1), which is not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP type 1 packet. ICMP type 1 corresponds to "destination unreachable" messages, which are normal network control messages.

No heuristic or taxonomy data is available, so no further classification can be made. However, given the data, no further investigation into ping floods is warranted. If suspicious activity is suspected, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies would be the next step.
