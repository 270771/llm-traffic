Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is the 17th column; values are 20, 1, 1, and 2 respectively), so none correspond to an ICMP Echo Request (type 8), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (1, 2, 20) correspond to destination unreachable, redirect, or other control messages, which are not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity patterns or other protocols.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to check for other attack vectors or anomalies.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
