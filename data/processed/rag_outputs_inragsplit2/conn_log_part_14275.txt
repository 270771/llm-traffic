Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.35.69, 133.247.29.250, 133.247.57.199, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 157.187.159.183.
- Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare incident response to maintain availability.
