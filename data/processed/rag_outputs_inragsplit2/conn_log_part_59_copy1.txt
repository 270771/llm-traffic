Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly record references a suspicious source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting port 23 (Telnet), categorized under heuristic 999 as 'mptmp' (likely multi-port or multi-target scanning), not related to ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the suspicious activity from 107.81.9.228 on port 23 further for potential Telnet scanning or brute force attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy related to ICMP ping floods is triggered, no immediate ICMP-specific response is required.
