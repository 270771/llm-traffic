Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The only anomalies present relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and an unknown anomaly (heuristic 999), neither of which indicate ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the anomaly for source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.  
- Heuristic 999 is an unspecified or unknown anomaly, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on 89.3.89.164:8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to capture ICMP traffic explicitly for future detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect emerging ping flood attacks.
