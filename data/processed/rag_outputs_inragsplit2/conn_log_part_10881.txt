Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests").
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP: Source IP 52.42.116.124 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation or mitigation steps.
