Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.36.162.241) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.124.138, 133.247.128.143, 133.247.189.36, etc.) targeting destination 18.36.162.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor the target host (18.36.162.241) for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if available.
