Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Additionally, there are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is below the threshold for detection.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors could be useful for early detection of other network issues.
