Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.104.17, 163.252.79.221, 163.252.195.184, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or null-route traffic from the offending IP if the attack persists.
