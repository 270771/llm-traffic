Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two: from 47.92.212.151 to 163.252.174.117 and from 203.78.177.156 to 196.85.140.62. This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability or misconfigurations but does not constitute a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages if they persist or increase.
