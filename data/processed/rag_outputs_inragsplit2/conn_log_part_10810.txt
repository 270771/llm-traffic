Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.54.169, 133.247.20.116, 133.247.97.215, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 is critical here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (35.183.65.24) for performance degradation and consider temporarily isolating it if service impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in coordinated ICMP flooding.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering.
