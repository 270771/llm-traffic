Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.181.17.215 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks), which flags high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.228.x.x subnet and a few others (202.202.x.x) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct network traffic filtering to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate attack sources.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as DDoS protection services.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.

This is a clear and active ICMP ping flood attack targeting 52.181.17.215.
