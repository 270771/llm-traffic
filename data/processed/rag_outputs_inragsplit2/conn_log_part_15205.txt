Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.187.198 to destination 37.142.118.5, with a single instance (count = 1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 133.228.62.233 to 96.75.46.185) is ICMP type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The heuristic for ping flood requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP type 8 packet is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
