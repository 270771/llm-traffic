Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), so the traffic is ICMP ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, this traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly datasets.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
