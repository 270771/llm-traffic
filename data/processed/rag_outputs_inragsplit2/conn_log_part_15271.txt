Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs (S0 state, SYN sent but no completion).  
- Taxonomy class for heuristic 10 is "ptmp" (partial TCP connection attempts), indicating SYN flood behavior rather than ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN flood indicated by heuristic 10 on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic separately to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if the SYN flood is causing service degradation and consider rate limiting or blocking offending IPs.
