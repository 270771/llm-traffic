Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 11 is Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack indicators.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies is recommended as a next step.
