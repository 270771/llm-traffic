Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, which aligns with the known requirement for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this pattern fits heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.16.x.x range targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as traffic anomaly detection systems.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
- If possible, apply geo-blocking or source IP reputation filtering to reduce attack surface.
