Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets or network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.14.252, 163.252.7.232, 203.78.178.187, 133.251.127.198, among others. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts or other suspicious activity from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, allowing only legitimate diagnostic use.
