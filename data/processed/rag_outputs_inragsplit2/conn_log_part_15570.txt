Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 9 and 1, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since ICMP type 9 (Router Advertisement) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) are normal control messages, these entries do not match typical attack patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate if these ICMP messages correlate with any network issues or misconfigurations.
