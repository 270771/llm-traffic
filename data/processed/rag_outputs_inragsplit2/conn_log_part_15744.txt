Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 4 times in the snippet (lines with ICMP type 8: 133.247.137.138 → 3.22.191.77, 133.247.137.149 → 3.22.191.77, 157.17.234.185 → 185.54.215.191, 133.247.79.75 → 3.22.191.77). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 13, 0) are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination typical of ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The OTH (other) connection state and low counts suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the sources 133.247.137.138, 133.247.137.149, 157.17.234.185, and 133.247.79.75 if they repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
