Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.228.4.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances exceeds the threshold of 10, confirming the volume criterion for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records explicitly mention heuristic 20 (Ping flood), but based on the heuristic context, this traffic fits heuristic 20 perfectly.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible coordinated DDoS activity.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.

This is a clear case of heuristic 20 (Ping flood) under the taxonomy class of ICMP-based Denial of Service attacks.
