Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly indicated as type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP connections per source IP is very low (only single instances per IP), far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and no payload or packet count indicates flooding behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets, possibly legitimate or benign scanning.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields explicitly in the full logs to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for heuristic 20 or other suspicious indicators once available.
