Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.201.198, 163.252.251.210, 163.252.192.102, 163.252.38.248, 163.252.132.10, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and servers for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS system.
- Consider deploying network-level ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies to prevent similar attacks in the future.
