Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse source IPs targeting one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.19.234, 157.17.18.160, 157.17.165.140, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP protocol (port field is 0 as expected for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood if they are internal or known malicious.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns to automate mitigation.
