Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records or type 8 packets appear in the provided data.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies; instead, they show anomalies related to TCP ports and other heuristics (e.g., heuristic 999, 10, 504).  
- Heuristic 20 specifically stands for ping flood detection, which is absent here. The anomalies present are categorized as 'mptmp' with heuristics unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalous TCP traffic from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination port 23 (Telnet), which is flagged under heuristic 999 (other) and may indicate suspicious activity such as scanning or brute forcing.  
- Review traffic for SYN flood (heuristic 10) or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as some anomalies suggest SYN attack heuristics.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to detect any potential ping floods not captured here.
