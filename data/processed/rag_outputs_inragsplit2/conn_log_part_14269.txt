Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets targeting 35.127.34.186, the total count of such packets in this snippet is 11, which meets the minimum threshold of 10 for a ping flood. However, the traffic appears to be from multiple distinct source IPs, each sending only a single packet (count=1 per entry), indicating no rapid repeated requests from the same source. This pattern does not match a typical ping flood, which involves high-frequency ICMP echo requests from one or few sources.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.

Since no ping flood is detected, no attack is present here. The traffic may represent normal network scanning or benign ICMP echo requests.

Recommendation: Monitor for any increase in frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from individual sources. Investigate if any source IPs begin sending multiple echo requests rapidly, which would indicate a developing ping flood attack. Without heuristic or taxonomy data, further investigation should focus on traffic volume trends and correlation with other network anomalies.
