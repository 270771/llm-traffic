Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or other anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs later match heuristic 20 or other suspicious patterns.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other threat intelligence sources.
