Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types seen (1 = Echo Reply, 13 = Timestamp Request) do not match typical flood attack patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs or ICMP types with heuristic 20 if it becomes available.
