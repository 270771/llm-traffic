Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.30.130, 157.17.3.51, 157.17.226.201, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.161.126.169. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Engage incident response to investigate potential botnet or compromised hosts within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services to protect the target IP.
  5. Notify network operations to verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
