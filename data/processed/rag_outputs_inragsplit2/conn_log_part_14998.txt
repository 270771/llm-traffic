Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this.  
- The other ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods and does not indicate flooding behavior.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no anomaly records or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or anomalies.  
- Investigate if any IPs involved have prior suspicious activity in other datasets.
