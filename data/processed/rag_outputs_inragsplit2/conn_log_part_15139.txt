Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomalies or heuristic matches are present.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 3 typically signals network issues or unreachable hosts, not flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages or a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets is recommended to detect potential future issues.
