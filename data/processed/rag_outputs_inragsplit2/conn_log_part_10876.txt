Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the provided logs, there are only two entries with ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 1, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs 157.17.194.39 and 133.247.71.129 if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in high volume.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
