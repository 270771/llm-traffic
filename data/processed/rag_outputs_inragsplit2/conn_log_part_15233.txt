Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present (count = 1), which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP connection entry. Without multiple repeated echo requests or known suspicious IPs flagged by heuristics, this traffic appears normal.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If counts rise above 10 or anomalies appear, re-evaluate for ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
