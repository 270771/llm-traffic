Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (unknown), but none reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which aligns with the TCP SYN flags seen in the conn.log entries (S0 state with SYN flags).
- Therefore, the traffic matches a SYN flood pattern rather than a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy explanation:
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by many TCP SYN packets without completing the handshake.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' (partial TCP message pattern) is consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged in anomaly_782 for potential SYN flood activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request traffic to detect possible ping floods in the future.
- Correlate with firewall and IDS logs to confirm SYN flood signatures and apply rate limiting or blocking rules accordingly.
