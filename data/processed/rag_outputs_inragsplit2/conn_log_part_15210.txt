Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 11, 11, and 10, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The ICMP types 10 and 11 correspond to "Timestamp Reply" and "Time Exceeded" messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages (types 10, 11) which could indicate misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
