Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP types in the log snippet are 0, 1, 3, or 11, but none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP connections, each with a count of 1, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests or known suspicious IPs.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate accordingly.
