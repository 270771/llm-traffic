Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are echo requests, the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- The absence of anomaly records or heuristic context requires assigning heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) as the most likely heuristic.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under denial-of-service attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 16.161.126.169 with ICMP echo requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 16.161.126.169.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and possible blocking.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Engage incident response to assess if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
