Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance per ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 0 (Echo Reply), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 3 (Destination Unreachable) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP error messages (types 3 or 11) that could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
