Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.116.11.97) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.101.171, 133.247.42.126, 133.247.117.48, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood, and the heuristic number can be assigned as 1 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) in absence of explicit data.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 3.116.11.97.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing if the attack escalates.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
