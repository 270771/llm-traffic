Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection. However, there are only 3 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 from the same source IP (35.130.188.37) to different destinations, totaling fewer than 10 instances.  
- Other ICMP types present (11, 3) are not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic volume and frequency do not match typical ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) are normal network control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning here.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or IDS alerts for suspicious ICMP activity.  
- Verifying if these ICMP messages correspond to legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.

No immediate security response is required based on this data.
