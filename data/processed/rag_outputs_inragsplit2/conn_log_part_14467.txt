Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 133.247.237.137 to 186.173.19.202 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or scanning but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.237.137 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data when available to detect evolving patterns.
