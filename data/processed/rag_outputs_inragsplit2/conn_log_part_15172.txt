Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (34.44.165.118) within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641099670.69). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts overwhelm a target with echo requests.
- Since all ICMP types are 8 (echo request), it confirms the traffic is ping-related. The volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet targeting destination IP 34.44.165.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP echo request.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 34.44.165.118.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to monitor for service degradation on the target host.
4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack volume escalates.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses and take remediation actions accordingly.
