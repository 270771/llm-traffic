Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 54.166.249.180 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 20 is commonly associated with ICMP flood detection).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (130.197.139.92), targeting destination IPs 54.166.249.180 and 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the echo request nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
