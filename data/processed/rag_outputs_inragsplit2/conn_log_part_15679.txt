Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), both unrelated to ICMP ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by anomaly_782 (heuristic 10) involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, as SYN floods can cause denial of service.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if any other anomalies related to ICMP appear, especially with ICMP type 8 packets.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood activity (heuristic 10), which targets TCP SYN flags, not ICMP.
