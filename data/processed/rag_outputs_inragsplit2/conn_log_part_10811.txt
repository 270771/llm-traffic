Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 35.183.65.24, from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP traffic.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic applicable here is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions, heuristic 20 relates to known anomalous src or dst IPs in ping flood detection). The taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under denial-of-service attacks.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Destination IP: 35.183.65.24 (target)
- Source IPs: Multiple from the 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 130.197.156.246
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.183.65.24.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider enabling ICMP rate limiting on the host firewall.
