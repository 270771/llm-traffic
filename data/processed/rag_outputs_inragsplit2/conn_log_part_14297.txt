Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IP 52.175.248.229 from many different source IPs, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.250.88, 157.17.168.130, 130.197.150.36, etc., all targeting destination IP 52.175.248.229 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.175.248.229.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network performance and logs for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic before it reaches the network.
