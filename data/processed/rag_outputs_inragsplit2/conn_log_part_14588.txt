Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence from 203.78.177.156 to 85.238.142.6. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
