Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.173.100.241 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.94.58, 133.247.252.184, 133.247.245.115, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 35.173.100.241 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a forensic review of the affected host and network to assess impact and identify any lateral movement or secondary effects.
