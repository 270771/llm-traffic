Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; they mostly indicate SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999).
- The heuristics confirm that ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs flagged under heuristic 20, neither of which are present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The SYN attack heuristic (10) is noted in anomalies but unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.

Heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack detection, and taxonomy 'ptmp' indicates partial TCP message patterns, unrelated to ping floods.
