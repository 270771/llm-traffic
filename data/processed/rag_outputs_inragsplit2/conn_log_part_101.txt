Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the single destination IP 3.20.63.105 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, with the anomaly targeting destination IP 3.20.63.105. The taxonomy class is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which falls under NetworkScanICMP, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are flooding 3.20.63.105 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.20.63.105.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  3. Monitor for further anomalous ICMP traffic and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block ping flood patterns.
  5. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack per heuristic 20 and NetworkScanICMP taxonomy.
