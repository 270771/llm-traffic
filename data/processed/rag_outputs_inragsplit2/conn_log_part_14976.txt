Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8 respectively. Only the second entry is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection.  
- There are only 2 instances total, and the threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified here.  
- The first entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if either IPs (202.194.17.61 or 139.179.133.57) appear in future anomaly reports or match known threat intelligence.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
