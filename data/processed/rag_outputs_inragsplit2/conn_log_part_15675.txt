Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type that is not explicitly stated as type 8 (echo request). The log entryâ€™s ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-", so we cannot confirm it is type 8. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic from source IP 133.228.62.233 to destination IP 129.222.30.2, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest this is a known attack pattern. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or matching heuristic 20 conditions, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection record. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns from these IPs. Specifically, collecting more connection logs over time to detect volume-based anomalies or correlating with other logs for heuristic matches would be advisable.
