Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. All entries are UDP or TCP, with no ICMP type indicated.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records, and no anomalies related to ICMP or ping floods are present.  
- The anomalies listed (heuristics 10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods. Heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack, and heuristic 999 is a custom heavy hitter classification.  
- No evidence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP is found, which is the threshold for ping flood detection unless heuristic 20 is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) further, as multiple TCP SYN attempts are visible in the logs (flag S set, state S0).  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods early.  
- Verify if any of the suspicious IPs in the anomaly CSV (e.g., 89.3.89.164 on port 8080) are involved in other attack types or lateral movement attempts.
