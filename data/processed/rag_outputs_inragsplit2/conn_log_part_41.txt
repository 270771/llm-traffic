Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from several source IPs, notably 13.22.70.201 and 133.16.14.149, sending at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a short time frame. This matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with abnormal ICMP traffic patterns typical in ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 13.22.70.201, and others sending ICMP type 8 packets.
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.210.170.22, 163.210.183.6, 23.91.142.4, and others.
  - Ports are not applicable for ICMP but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 133.16.14.149 and 13.22.70.201.
  2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flooding and correlate with other logs to detect possible lateral movement or secondary attacks.
  3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic sources for potential upstream filtering.
  4. Harden internal hosts by disabling unnecessary ICMP responses if possible.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis on affected hosts to ensure no compromise beyond the DoS attack vector.

This conclusion is supported by heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class indicating abnormal ICMP traffic consistent with a ping flood attack.
