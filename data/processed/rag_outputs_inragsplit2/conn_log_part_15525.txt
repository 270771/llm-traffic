Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood, but monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or other suspicious activity is recommended.
