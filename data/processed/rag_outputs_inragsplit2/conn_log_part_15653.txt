Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.169.51.96 within a very short time window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single host, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.165.153, 157.17.175.183, 157.17.27.210, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 35.169.51.96. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the destination host 35.169.51.96 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or involvement in a botnet.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting 35.169.51.96.
