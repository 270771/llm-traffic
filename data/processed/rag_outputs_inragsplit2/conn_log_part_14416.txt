Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a single source IP (52.158.11.176) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short time frame (~0.007 to 0.012 seconds per connection), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.158.11.176 flooding multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.158.11.176 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify any collateral impact on targeted hosts.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected network segments.
