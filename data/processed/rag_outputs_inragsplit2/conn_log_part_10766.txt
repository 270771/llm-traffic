Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from a single source IP (44.53.133.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time frame, matching the threshold for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard network security heuristics, this pattern aligns with a volumetric ICMP Echo Request flood (heuristic 20 commonly relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.53.133.97; Destination IPs include 163.252.249.235, 163.252.249.56, 163.252.21.198, 163.252.143.181, 163.252.212.57, 163.252.180.73, 163.252.143.249, 163.252.40.184, 163.252.40.185, 163.252.249.177.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 44.53.133.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this or other sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and consider disabling ICMP Echo Requests if not required for legitimate network operations.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
