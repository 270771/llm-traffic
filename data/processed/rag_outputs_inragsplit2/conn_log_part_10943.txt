Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.173.100.241 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to suspicious ICMP echo request floods) and fits the taxonomy class of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.115.248, 157.17.25.198, 157.17.8.40, etc.) are flooding ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.173.100.241. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host 35.173.100.241 for service degradation.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse and consider blacklisting or blocking them upstream.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
