Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 52.236.221.123 and 163.252.82.193.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate known suspicious IPs or behavior matching heuristic 20.  
- No anomaly CSV data or heuristic context is available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of a single ICMP echo request and an ICMP error message is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any new anomaly records appear related to these IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential emerging patterns.
