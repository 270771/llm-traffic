Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 133.247.49.34 and 184.246.188.3.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential slow or low-volume ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
