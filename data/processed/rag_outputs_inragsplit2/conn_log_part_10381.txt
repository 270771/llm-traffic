Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.22.151.10) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.17.32, 133.247.74.240, 133.247.11.162, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 18.22.151.10. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host (18.22.151.10) for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP range if it is not part of legitimate traffic.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
