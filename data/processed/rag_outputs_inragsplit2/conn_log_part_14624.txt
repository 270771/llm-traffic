Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless overridden by known anomalous IPs (none found here). The volume and distribution of ICMP type 8 packets strongly indicate a ping flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.195.104, 157.17.151.193, 157.17.52.114, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), port fields are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Most likely heuristic: Heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection by volume and type).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
4. Conduct a forensic review of source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed.
5. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
