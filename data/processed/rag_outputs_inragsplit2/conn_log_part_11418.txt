Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating primarily from IPs 54.183.76.138 and 18.22.226.126 targeting a wide range of destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic #20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 18.22.226.126; multiple destination IPs in 163.252.0.0/16; ICMP protocol, type 8 (echo request), port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
  3. Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider of the malicious source IPs for possible mitigation.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS protection services.
  5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include rapid response to ICMP flood attacks.
