Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is represented by the source port column for ICMP traffic (commonly the ICMP type). Here, the values are 11 and 8 for the two entries. Only the second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping).  
- However, there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 is a Time Exceeded message, which is not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or match known suspicious IP lists.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of ping flooding emerges.
