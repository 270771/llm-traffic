Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP without legitimate response patterns. This fits heuristic #20 (assumed for ICMP flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and one from 202.202.88.226, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or secondary attacks.
  4. Notify the affected system owners and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or outage.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
