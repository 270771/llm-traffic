Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP Destination Unreachable messages, which can be normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential scanning or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Investigate if these ICMP Destination Unreachable messages correlate with any service disruptions or misconfigurations.
