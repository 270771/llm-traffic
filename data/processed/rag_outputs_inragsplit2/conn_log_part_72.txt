Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The source IP 143.224.94.6 is repeatedly sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 133.26.144.0/24 subnet, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood. Although this IP is involved in some ICMP traffic, the main flood source appears to be 143.224.94.6 based on volume.
- The taxonomy class relevant here is "icmp_error" under the "Other" category, matching the anomaly record and heuristic 20 for ping flood.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the repeated ICMP type 8 packets and OTH (other) connection state confirm the nature of the traffic.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 143.224.94.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor for collateral impact on the targeted subnet 133.26.144.0/24 and ensure critical services remain available.
3. Investigate the source host 143.224.94.6 for compromise or misuse, including checking for malware or botnet involvement.
4. Correlate with other network logs and anomaly detection systems for signs of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) activity.
5. Notify upstream providers if the attack volume escalates or persists to coordinate broader mitigation.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error" (Other), confirming a classic ICMP ping flood attack pattern.
