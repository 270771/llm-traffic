Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log entries is `8` (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as ICMP type mismatches or port scans.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out a ping flood if the volume increases.
