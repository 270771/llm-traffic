Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.9.51.14) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-frequency ICMP echo requests from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP for potential wider mitigation.
4. Investigate internal logs for any impact on targeted hosts and ensure no lateral movement or exploitation occurred.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place to automate future responses.
