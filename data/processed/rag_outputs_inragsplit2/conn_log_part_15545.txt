Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic volume increases.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in larger quantities.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
