Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.237.185.15 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all relevant entries, satisfying the requirement for ping flood detection.
- The number of instances (over 20) exceeds the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present in the snippet.
- Although the anomaly CSV mentions an anomaly with IP 157.17.197.36, it is unrelated to the current destination IP and uses heuristic 999, which does not apply here. Therefore, the most likely heuristic for this ping flood is heuristic 20 (common for ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "DoS" (Denial of Service).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 157.17.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.17.25.198, 157.17.44.112, 157.17.197.36) targeting destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) to the target IP 54.237.185.15.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet or compromised hosts within the source subnet.
- Engage network operations to verify the criticality of the target host and consider temporarily isolating it if service disruption is detected.
- Deploy or update DoS mitigation tools and ensure upstream providers are informed to assist with traffic filtering if the attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IPs to identify infection vectors or lateral movement within the network.
