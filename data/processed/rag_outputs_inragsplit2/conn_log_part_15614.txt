Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 1 is an Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, neither of which alone signify flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if more ICMP type 8 packets appear in logs.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or repeated requests from the same IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
