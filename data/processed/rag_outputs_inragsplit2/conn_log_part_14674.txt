Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo requests) must be 8 to indicate a ping flood. In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IP 180.168.238.107 and 157.17.231.174).
- The total count of ICMP type 8 entries is only 2, which is below the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11) do not correspond to echo requests and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs that would override the count threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or unrelated issues.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if network connectivity issues are suspected.
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
