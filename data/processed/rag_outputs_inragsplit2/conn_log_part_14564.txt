Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating predominantly from IP 54.9.51.14 targeting a wide range of destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet, with at least 20 distinct instances observed in a very short time window (~0.01 seconds). This pattern of high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the general heuristic that a ping flood involves at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations or a single destination in rapid succession.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14 is the primary attacker; destination IPs include multiple hosts in the 163.252.0.0/16 range. Other sources like 35.130.188.37 and 73.152.84.127 also send ICMP type 8 packets but less frequently.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8 (echo request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor for additional ICMP flood attempts from other IPs such as 35.130.188.37 and 73.152.84.127.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in the attack.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
