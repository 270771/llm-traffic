Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 203.78.178.13) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services on the target host.
  4. Engage incident response to investigate potential botnet involvement or compromised hosts in the source IP range.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
