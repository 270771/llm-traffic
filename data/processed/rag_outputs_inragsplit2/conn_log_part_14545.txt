Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  
- The connection states are "OTH" (other), and the traffic volumes (72 and 112 bytes) are low and isolated, not indicative of flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, this traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have any prior history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential flooding or other ICMP-based attacks.
