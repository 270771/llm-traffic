Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple source IPs. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 161.67.57.135.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on the targeted host.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
