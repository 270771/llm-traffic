Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from IPs 131.176.198.190 to 129.235.234.57 and 133.247.49.34 to 104.8.122.4).  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11, 13) are present but these correspond to Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, and Timestamp respectively, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if they persist, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate for potential threats.
