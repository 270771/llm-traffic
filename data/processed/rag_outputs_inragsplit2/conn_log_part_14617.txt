Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8 except one unrelated ICMP type 1 entry, which does not affect the conclusion.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and one 133.251.x.x subnet are flooding ICMP echo requests to destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests to 161.67.57.135 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or throttle the identified source IPs (157.17.111.252, 157.17.14.133, 157.17.103.254, etc.).
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Deploy or tune DDoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate volumetric ICMP floods.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams for further forensic analysis and remediation.
