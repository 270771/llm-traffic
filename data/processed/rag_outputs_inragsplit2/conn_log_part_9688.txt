Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.152.76.54 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- The volume and multiplicity of unique source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated flooding attempt.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.228.204.214, 130.197.174.232) targeting destination IP 54.152.76.54 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.152.76.54.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking source IPs if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
5. Alert the incident response team to investigate the affected host 54.152.76.54 for service impact and potential compromise.
