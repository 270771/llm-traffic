Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the conn.log snippet does not show any ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The first record shows ICMP traffic between 203.78.184.38 and 80.142.66.223 with no indication of ICMP type 8.  
- The second record involves IPv6 addresses and ICMP traffic but again no ICMP type 8 is indicated.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomalies or heuristic matches are present in the anomaly CSV.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP types in more detail if full packet captures or detailed logs are available.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
