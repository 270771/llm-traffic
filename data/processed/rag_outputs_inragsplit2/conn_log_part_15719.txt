Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) not being present, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is met, confirming the ping flood.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and the destination IP 52.236.221.123. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), and ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.236.221.123.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the target host.
  5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.
