Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from source IP 163.171.168.73 to two different destination IPs (202.194.36.1 and 202.194.37.57). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with broader network logs to detect if these IPs show other suspicious behaviors.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.
