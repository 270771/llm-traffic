Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP type must be 8 to qualify as ping flood traffic, and here it is either missing or zero, which does not indicate Echo Requests.  
- The number of ICMP connections from the source IP 203.65.114.222 to various destinations is fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8. Most entries show only 1 packet or 0 packets, except one with 27 packets, but without confirmation that these are type 8, it does not meet the threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be sporadic ICMP with low packet counts, not consistent with flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type field in more detail if available from raw packet captures or extended logs to confirm the ICMP message types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for heuristic matches once available.
