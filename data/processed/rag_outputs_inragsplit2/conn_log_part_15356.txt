Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No further immediate action is required, but monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
