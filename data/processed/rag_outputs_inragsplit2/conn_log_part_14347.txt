Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: ICMP flood).
- Involved IP: Source 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external and coordinate for mitigation.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
