Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly "3" (Destination Unreachable) and one "8" (Echo Request). According to the criteria, only ICMP type 8 packets count toward ping flood detection.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (line with src IP 139.179.133.57 and dst IP 203.78.173.107), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV.  
- The other ICMP types (3) indicate error messages, not echo requests used in ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages suggests normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends echo requests, as it could be a precursor to a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
