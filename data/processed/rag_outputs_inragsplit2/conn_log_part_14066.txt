Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.33.149.154, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.33.149.154. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 34.33.149.154 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Additionally, block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.247.0.0/16 until further investigation. Monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing traffic if attack persists. Notify network operations and incident response teams for further forensic analysis.
