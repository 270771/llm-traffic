Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the Zeek conn.log corresponds to ICMP type 11, Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP payload or packet-level data to confirm if any abnormal ICMP echo request patterns emerge.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing loops.
