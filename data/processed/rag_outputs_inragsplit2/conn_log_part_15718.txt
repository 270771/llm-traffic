Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records or heuristic context requires assigning heuristic 20 by default, which corresponds to detection of ICMP flood attacks in typical taxonomies.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the victim host (52.236.221.123) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
