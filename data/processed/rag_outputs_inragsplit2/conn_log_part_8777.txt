Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets targeting the same destination IPs, specifically 54.212.29.159 and 52.42.116.124, with at least 20+ instances observed in a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from ranges 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 54.212.29.159 and 52.42.116.124. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Engage upstream providers to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources if attack volume persists.
  3. Monitor affected hosts (54.212.29.159 and 52.42.116.124) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
