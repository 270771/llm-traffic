Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from IPs 133.247.170.126 to 54.229.78.71 and 203.78.187.167 to 69.87.118.89, but there are only 2 such instances in the snippet.
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not relevant for ping flood detection.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out a ping flood attack.
