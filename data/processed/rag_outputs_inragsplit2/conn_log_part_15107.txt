Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood attack, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target. The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood in absence of known heuristics.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"Denial of Service (DoS)"** due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.

Involved IPs:
- Victim (destination): 13.86.47.233
- Multiple attackers (sources): 133.247.118.251, 133.247.161.195, 133.247.44.22, 133.247.38.47, 133.247.25.249, 133.247.46.125, 133.247.173.93, 133.247.161.200, 133.247.67.25, 133.247.73.145, 133.247.124.138, 133.247.231.165, 133.247.231.187, 133.247.38.8, 133.247.231.248, 133.247.51.222, 133.247.109.186, 133.247.177.200, 133.247.136.197, 133.247.67.57, 133.247.65.158, 133.247.178.223, 133.247.105.156

Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP addresses if possible.
- Monitor the victim host (13.86.47.233) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for potential upstream filtering.
