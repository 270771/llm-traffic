Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows an ICMP type that is not explicitly stated as type 8 (echo request). The log field for ICMP type is "-", indicating no type 8 packets are present. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is recorded, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.228.62.233) or to the same destination IP (51.217.131.204). If multiple ICMP echo requests accumulate, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate the source IP for any other suspicious activity.
