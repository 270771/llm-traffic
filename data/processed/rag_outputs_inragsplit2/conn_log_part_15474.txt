Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or checking other logs for heuristic 20 matches or related anomalies.
