Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.41, and there is only one instance of it.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 1 (Destination Unreachable) from 203.78.180.123 to 167.58.181.228, which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other anomaly indicators in extended logs.
