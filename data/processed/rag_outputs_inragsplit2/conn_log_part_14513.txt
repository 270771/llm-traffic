Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly `1` or `0` (likely indicating codes or other fields), but the key ICMP type for ping requests is type 8, which is not present in these entries.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- The number of ICMP packets per source-destination pair is very low (mostly 1 or 2), far below the threshold of 10 instances required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not available here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the data. The traffic appears to be sporadic ICMP messages, possibly error or informational messages (e.g., type 3 = destination unreachable, type 11 = time exceeded), which are normal in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types present (e.g., type 3 and 11) to ensure they are expected in the network context.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or volume spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
