Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different source IP (89.3.89.164) and port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood detection, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture ICMP type 8 packets for future detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP traffic or anomalies matching heuristic 20.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack patterns, typically TCP SYN floods or scans.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks involving ICMP type 8 packets.

No evidence currently supports a ping flood attack in the provided data.
