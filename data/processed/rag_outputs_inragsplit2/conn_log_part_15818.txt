Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 69.47.68.228 within a very short time window. This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves overwhelming a target with numerous ICMP Echo Requests.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, satisfying the requirement that only type 8 indicates ping flood.
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 (ping flood) are explicitly listed in the anomaly CSV, but the volume and pattern alone meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances.
- The anomaly CSV shows one anomaly (anomaly_1052) related to source IP 130.197.24.226 on an unknown port to port 443, categorized as 'ptmp' with heuristic 504 (HTTPS traffic). This is unrelated to the ping flood but confirms some anomalous activity on the network.
- Since no heuristic 20 is explicitly assigned in the anomaly CSV, assign heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" based on the observed traffic pattern.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 130.197.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 130.197.154.214, 130.197.25.0, 130.197.21.30, etc.)
- Destination IP: 69.47.68.228
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (130.197.0.0/16) targeting 69.47.68.228.
2. Monitor the affected host (69.47.68.228) for signs of service degradation or denial of service.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misconfiguration causing the flood.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.

Heuristic and taxonomy reference:
- Heuristic 20: Ping flood detection based on ICMP type 8 volume.
- Taxonomy class: ICMP Flood (denial of service via ICMP Echo Requests).
