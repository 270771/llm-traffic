Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) detected on port 8080 and 1433, as these indicate potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are exhibiting heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999) that could indicate other volumetric attacks.

In conclusion, no ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter activity (heuristic 999), which should be further investigated.
