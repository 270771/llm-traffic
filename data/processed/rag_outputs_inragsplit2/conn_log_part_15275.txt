Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The anomalies present relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), which correspond to TCP SYN floods or high-volume suspicious connections, not ICMP floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping floods, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- The anomalies detected are categorized as 'ptmp' (partial TCP message patterns) and 'heavy_hitter' (high volume), none related to ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by analyzing TCP SYN packet rates and sources.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing service degradation due to SYN floods or other TCP-based attacks.

No ping flood is detected at this time.
