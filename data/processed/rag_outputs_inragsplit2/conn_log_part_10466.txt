Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 4th field after source IP is actually the ICMP type; here it is 11, not 8).
- Ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets.
- There are only two ICMP entries total, which is well below the threshold of 10 instances for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate if ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) traffic spikes, which may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data for deeper analysis.
