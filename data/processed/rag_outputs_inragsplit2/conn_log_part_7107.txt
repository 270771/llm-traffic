Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.230.228.52, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources sending ICMP type 8 packets) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.71.178, 133.247.116.141, 133.247.162.62, etc.) all targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks targeting 52.230.228.52.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Monitor the target host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
