Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (from 130.197.147.190 to 16.160.194.189).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to identify emerging threats.
