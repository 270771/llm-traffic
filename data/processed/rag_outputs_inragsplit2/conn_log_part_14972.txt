Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided as type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic does not qualify as ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connection records are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no alternative classification can be assigned confidently.

Next steps:  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs to verify if Echo Requests are involved.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in other anomaly or threat intelligence feeds.
