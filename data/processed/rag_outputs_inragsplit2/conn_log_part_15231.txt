Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps: Investigate further ICMP traffic for volume and type 8 presence. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs to rule out stealthy ping floods or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
