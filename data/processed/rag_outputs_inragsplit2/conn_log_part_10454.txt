Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided in the anomaly CSV for this exact pattern, the behavior aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) indicating volumetric ICMP echo request abuse.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.51.248, 157.17.18.152, 157.17.160.103, etc.) flooding destination IP 44.61.16.153. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0 or unknown.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 157.17.0.0/16 at perimeter firewalls or intrusion prevention systems.
  2. Monitor and alert on continued ICMP type 8 traffic spikes targeting 44.61.16.153.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
  4. Conduct forensic analysis on affected host 44.61.16.153 for service impact and potential compromise.
  5. Update incident response playbooks to include detection and mitigation of distributed ICMP ping floods referencing heuristic 20 (ICMP flood) taxonomy class.
