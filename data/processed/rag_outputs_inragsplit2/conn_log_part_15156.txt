Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.238.213.5) from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (52.238.213.5) for performance degradation or service disruption.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
