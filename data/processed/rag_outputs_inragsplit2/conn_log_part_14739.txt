Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (echo request) targeting a single destination IP (54.23.202.254) within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the echo request used in ping floods, and the volume and concentration of these requests from multiple source IPs strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) or a default heuristic for ICMP flood detection.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.23.202.254 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host and network for signs of service degradation or denial.
  4. Conduct a source traceback to identify if these IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
