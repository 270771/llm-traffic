Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 8, and 11. Only two instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume of ICMP Echo Requests and absence of repeated or sustained traffic patterns typical of flooding means no immediate threat is detected.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (203.78.177.156, 35.130.188.37) appear in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
