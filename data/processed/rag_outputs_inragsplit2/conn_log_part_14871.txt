Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 18.101.165.68. This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.50.189, 133.247.139.227, 133.247.123.99, etc.) all targeting destination IP 18.101.165.68 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 18.101.165.68 for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify network operations and consider blackholing or null-routing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
