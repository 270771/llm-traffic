Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP type 8 packets reaches or exceeds the threshold.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP types or patterns if they persist or increase.
