Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets in a short period, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (157.17.235.180, 157.17.107.31, 157.17.102.23, 157.17.185.27, 157.17.212.96, 157.17.107.57, 157.17.250.56, 157.17.230.129, 157.17.212.69, 157.17.212.98, 157.17.225.7, 157.17.170.237) targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host 52.237.221.62 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required.
