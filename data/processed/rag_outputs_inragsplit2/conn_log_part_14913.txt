Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present, but each source IP sends only a single instance; there are no repeated pings from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets directed at 52.239.117.247 is 10, but these come from distinct source IPs, not multiple repeated pings from one or few sources, which is typical in a ping flood.
- No known anomalous IPs or heuristic matches are present since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided.
- The presence of multiple distinct sources sending single ICMP echo requests may indicate scanning or benign network activity rather than a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP echo requests for possible reconnaissance activity.
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
