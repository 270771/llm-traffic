Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 44.53.133.97 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm the network or hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.53.133.97; Destination IPs include 163.252.3.130, 163.252.221.62, 163.252.180.62, 163.252.8.48, 163.252.8.175, 163.252.215.94, 163.252.192.154, 163.252.242.187, 163.252.242.219, 163.252.181.17, 163.252.40.244, 163.252.189.227, 163.252.189.194, 163.252.125.229, 163.252.220.6, 163.252.251.182, 163.252.184.25, 163.252.102.6.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 44.53.133.97 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or denial of service.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers if the source IP is external to mitigate attack traffic upstream.
