Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 3, 128, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (in fact, zero), the traffic does not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other known attack patterns.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP types observed correspond to:  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable (normal network behavior or error)  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded (common in traceroute or routing issues)  
- Type 128: Echo Reply (response to ping, not an attack)  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors that could indicate scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
