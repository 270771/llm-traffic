Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.181.17.215.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Monitor network and host performance metrics for signs of service degradation.
