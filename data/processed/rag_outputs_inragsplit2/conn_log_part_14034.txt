Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 11, 8, and 10. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 133.247.173.120 to 35.173.100.241). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 10 may warrant routine network troubleshooting or further investigation if unusual volumes are detected, but no immediate threat is evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.173.120 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.
