Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 133.16.14.149 and other sources such as 18.116.76.138 and 54.203.245.209 targeting various destination IPs.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- The involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 18.116.76.138, 54.203.245.209, 157.78.78.187, 52.188.50.100, among others.
  - Destination IPs: 23.79.61.250, 163.210.78.150, 163.210.170.22, 203.114.135.69, 104.70.150.3, 104.78.197.250, 104.88.126.4, etc.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the log shows ICMP protocol and type 8 consistently.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 and other identified suspicious IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP type 8 floods from other sources and apply similar mitigation.
3. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source hosts to determine if they are compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attacks.
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network monitoring tools to automate future detection.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error," confirming a classic ICMP Echo Request flood DoS attack pattern.
