Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 203.78.180.211 to 139.179.133.57 with a single record. The other ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply) from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.190, which is not type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over time.  
- Checking for other types of ICMP abuse or different protocols showing anomalies.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
