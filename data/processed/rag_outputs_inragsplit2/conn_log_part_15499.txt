Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in any anomaly records.  
- The anomalies listed relate mostly to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters, none indicating ICMP or ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen here.  
- The taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'heavy_hitter' relate to port scanning or volumetric TCP anomalies, not ICMP floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets for potential SYN flood or port scanning activity, as indicated by heuristic 10 anomalies.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to catch ping floods early.
