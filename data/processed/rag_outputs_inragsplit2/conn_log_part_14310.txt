Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 11, 128, and 8. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 3.89.103.26 to 203.78.148.105), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 128 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 128 is normal in network diagnostics and does not suggest flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, which may indicate early stages of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
