Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP: Attacker/source IP is 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this and related IPs.
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or mitigating traffic from the attacker IP.
4. Conduct a network-wide review for any impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events early.
