Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175. This satisfies the condition of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a flood of ping requests.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack, and the taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP anomalies, consistent with ICMP echo request floods.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- The traffic pattern matches known ping flood behavior: many ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single victim IP, overwhelming it with ICMP traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.239.183.175.
2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses in the 157.161.0.0/16 subnet involved in the flood.
3. Monitor for any signs of service degradation or denial of service on the target host.
4. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if the attack volume escalates.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is only allowed where necessary.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy NetworkScanICMP), requiring immediate mitigation to protect the targeted host.
