Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records. The anomalies present relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), none of which indicate ICMP or ping flood activity.  
- The anomaly taxonomy classes found are 'ptmp' (point-to-multipoint SYN attack) and 'heavy_hitter', unrelated to ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) on suspicious ports such as 8080 and 1433, as these may indicate scanning or brute force attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any network devices or IDS sensors are filtering or not logging ICMP traffic properly, as absence of ICMP logs may hinder detection.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP connection attempts with SYN flags.  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' indicates point-to-multipoint attack patterns, often related to scanning or SYN floods.  
- Heuristic 999 indicates heavy hitter anomalies, typically high-volume traffic from a source.

No evidence supports a ping flood attack at this time.
