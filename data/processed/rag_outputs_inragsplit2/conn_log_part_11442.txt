Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 5 distinct entries with type 8 are visible (from IPs 210.122.63.39, 210.122.62.161, 210.122.63.43, 210.122.63.105, and one other). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the provided CSV.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The other ICMP types (3, 11) correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are normal network control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be assigned. Next steps: continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets or presence of known suspicious IPs. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related anomalies in other logs.
