Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 4 and 0, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (4 = Source Quench, 0 = Echo Reply) do not match typical attack patterns such as ping floods or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic volume and frequency to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in source/destination IPs if new data becomes available.
