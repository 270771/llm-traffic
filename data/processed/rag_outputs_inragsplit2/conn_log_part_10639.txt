Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.237.185.15 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, as ICMP ping floods aim to exhaust network or host resources.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 202.194.17.63, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.237.185.15.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network and host performance metrics for signs of resource exhaustion.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic closer to the source.
