Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.48 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches a generic ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 69.47.68.48 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.247.0.0/16 if possible.
- Monitor the target host 69.47.68.48 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Conduct a network-wide review to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
