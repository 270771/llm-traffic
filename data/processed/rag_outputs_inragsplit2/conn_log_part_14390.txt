Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.18.10) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.42.126, 133.247.24.25, 133.247.61.98, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.127.18.10 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the echo request (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 35.127.18.10.
- Monitor the target host for signs of resource exhaustion or service degradation.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to trace and mitigate the distributed sources.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified sources if the attack persists.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary use cases only.
