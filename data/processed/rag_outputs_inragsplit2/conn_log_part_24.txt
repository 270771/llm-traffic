Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. Specifically, there are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs (e.g., 23.66.194.4, 104.90.124.246, 78.254.73.189, 23.81.89.252, 104.76.133.234, 23.243.65.255, 92.139.83.249, 95.101.19.7, 104.90.237.3). This volume and pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious with heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack. The anomaly is categorized as 'icmp_error' in the taxonomy, which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding.

- Involved IP addresses:  
  - Source IP: 133.16.14.149 (attacker)  
  - Multiple destination IPs across the internet (victims), ports are irrelevant for ICMP.

- Recommended security response plan:  
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
  2. Monitor for any other hosts exhibiting similar ICMP flooding behavior.  
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to identify compromise or malware causing the flood.  
  4. Implement network-level ICMP rate limiting to prevent future volumetric ICMP floods.  
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact on network performance.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the taxonomy class 'icmp_error' indicating an ICMP-based denial-of-service attack.
