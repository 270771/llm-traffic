Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) from the same source to the same destination, which is a key indicator of a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

The ICMP type 11 indicates a different network condition (likely traceroute or TTL expiration), not a ping flood. Without evidence of repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs flagged by heuristic 20, no ping flood or related attack is detected.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood mitigation. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or anomalies involving these IPs is recommended to detect any emerging threats.
