Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which typically falls under heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include 163.252.104.57, 163.252.184.1, 163.252.228.220, 163.252.170.167, 163.252.104.16, 163.252.24.231, 163.252.222.6, 163.252.18.101, 163.252.200.171, 163.252.200.170, 163.252.24.211, 163.252.129.73, 163.252.129.254, 163.252.129.118. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices for signs of service degradation or packet loss on affected destination IPs.
  3. Conduct a forensic review of the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
  5. Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
