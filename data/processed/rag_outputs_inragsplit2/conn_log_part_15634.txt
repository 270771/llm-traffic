Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source").
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or wider attack patterns.
