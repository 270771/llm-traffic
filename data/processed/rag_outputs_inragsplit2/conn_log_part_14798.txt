Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.28, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the log snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packets are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 1 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability issues but do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 and 1 messages to ensure network stability and proper routing.
