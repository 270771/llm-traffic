Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ping flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPâ€™s network segment to identify if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider notifying upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and persistent.
