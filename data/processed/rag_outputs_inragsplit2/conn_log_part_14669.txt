Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 163.252.9.189, 202.194.17.63) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP port 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
  5. Monitor network and host performance for signs of service degradation or failure.
