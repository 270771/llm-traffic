Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 15 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs include multiple sources from the 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges targeting 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55 on ICMP type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x) targeting the victim IPs.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and consider upstream provider coordination for traffic filtering.
- Deploy or update IDS/IPS signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
