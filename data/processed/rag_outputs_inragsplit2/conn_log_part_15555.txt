Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 is a Time Exceeded message, not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages are part of a traceroute or legitimate network diagnostics.
