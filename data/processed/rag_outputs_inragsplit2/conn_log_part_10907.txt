Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 9 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no known suspicious IPs are indicated.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be multiple ICMP echo requests from a single source IP (54.249.10.152) to various destination IPs, which could be normal network scanning or monitoring activity.

Next steps: Investigate if the source IP 54.249.10.152 is authorized to perform such ICMP traffic volume. Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests beyond the threshold or any matching heuristic 20 anomalies. Collect more data to confirm or rule out a ping flood attack.
