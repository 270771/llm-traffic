Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.23.202.254. This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one target is a classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) from various sources targeting one destination, overwhelming it.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source IP 133.247.49.34 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.23.202.254. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.23.202.254.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host and consider isolating it if service degradation occurs.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to drop excessive ICMP traffic targeting critical assets.
