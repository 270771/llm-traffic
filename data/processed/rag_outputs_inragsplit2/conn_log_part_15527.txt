Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 11, and 3. Only the entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 3 messages may suggest normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.177.156 repeatedly sends echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
