Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.115, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or checking other logs for related anomalies.
