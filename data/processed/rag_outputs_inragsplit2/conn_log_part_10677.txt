Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the data to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 typically indicates network or host unreachable errors, which may warrant further network troubleshooting but do not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages if network connectivity issues persist.
