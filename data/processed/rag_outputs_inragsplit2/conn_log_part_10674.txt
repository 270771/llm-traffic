Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.178.233.150, from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic signature of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most relevant heuristic is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions, related to known anomalous IPs or ping flood detection).  
- The taxonomy class is "Ping Flood" under ICMP-based Denial of Service attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.178.233.150 (destination of all ICMP Echo Requests)  
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 130.197.61.72, 130.197.61.122, 130.197.23.251, etc.)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the victim IP.  
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are external.  
4. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are similarly targeted or involved.  
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged.  
6. If possible, engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in mitigating the attack at a higher network level.
