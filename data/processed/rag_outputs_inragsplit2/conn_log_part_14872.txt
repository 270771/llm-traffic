Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.101.165.68, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.97.126, 133.247.101.165, 133.247.144.59, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.101.165.68 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Monitor the target host 18.101.165.68 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls such as ICMP rate limiting or blackholing suspicious traffic.
  4. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
