Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.229.78.71) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests, consistent with a volumetric ICMP flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 54.229.78.71; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.229.78.71.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to upstream providers if attack volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.
- Deploy or verify existing DDoS mitigation tools and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if necessary.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential compromised hosts within the source IP range.
