Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 218.59.249.253 to 163.252.14.200, but only a single instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 218.59.249.253 appears frequently in other logs or anomaly reports.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
