Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types in the log entries are 0 and 11, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly flags, this traffic does not match ping flood or other known ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any new anomaly records or heuristics become available that might indicate other suspicious activity.
