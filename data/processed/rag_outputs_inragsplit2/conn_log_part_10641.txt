Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.237.185.15, from multiple source IPs. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks), which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.237.185.15. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.237.185.15.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs sending excessive ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation or further attack vectors.
