Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.160.152.89) from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.119.243, 133.228.127.252, 133.228.57.7, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (16.160.152.89) for performance degradation and consider isolating it if service impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate potentially compromised hosts within the 133.228.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or network administrators to assist in blocking or tracing the attack sources.
