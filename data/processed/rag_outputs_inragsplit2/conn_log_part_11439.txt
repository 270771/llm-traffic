Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 18.36.162.241, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 130.197.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 211.156.88.104) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.36.162.241 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 18.36.162.241.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP flood behavior.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs for broader attack patterns.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
