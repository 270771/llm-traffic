Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.166.249.180) within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection (likely heuristic 20) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range flooding the destination IP 54.166.249.180 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (54.166.249.180) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the flood traffic.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
