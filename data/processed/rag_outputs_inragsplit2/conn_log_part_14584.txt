Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but no ICMP traffic entries.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP packets are present in the snippet.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood heuristic 20.
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and an unknown anomaly on port 46280, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- The anomalies here are categorized as 'ptmp' (heuristic 10, SYN attack) and 'mptmp' (heuristic 999, unknown anomaly), neither indicating ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomaly_1442 on IP 45.136.197.42 port 46280 further, as it is marked with heuristic 999 (unknown anomaly) and may indicate suspicious activity unrelated to ping floods.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic specifically to detect any future ping flood attempts.
