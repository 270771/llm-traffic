Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.228.x.x range and one from 61.1.51.193, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.160.152.89. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.160.152.89.
  2. Investigate and potentially block the identified source IPs at the firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying anti-DDoS mitigation services.
