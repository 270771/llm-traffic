Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (timestamps 1641790884.196583 and 1641790885.142982), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Most ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 or are unspecified (“-”), and no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found).  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations or a single destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP, especially 203.65.114.222, which appears frequently as a source.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Enable alerting on ICMP Echo Request rates exceeding normal baselines to detect potential future ping floods.
