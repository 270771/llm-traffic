Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), unrelated to ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are observed here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 in anomaly_782, as SYN floods can cause denial of service.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood attempts are occurring.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods early.
