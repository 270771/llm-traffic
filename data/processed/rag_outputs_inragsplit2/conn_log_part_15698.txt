Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- Only one instance of each ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of 10 required for ping flood detection unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not indicated here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are normal ICMP control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
