Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed or spoofed source pattern typical of ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IPs are:
  - Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.23.105 through 133.247.96.131
  - Destination IP: 54.193.126.151

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host (54.193.126.151) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block the malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to assess the attack scope.
- Prepare incident response to mitigate impact and collect forensic data for attribution.
