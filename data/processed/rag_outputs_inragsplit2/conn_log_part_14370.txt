Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 with ICMP Echo Requests on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so this is standard).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range. Additionally, monitor the target host for service degradation and consider blackholing traffic from the offending IPs if the attack persists. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet.
