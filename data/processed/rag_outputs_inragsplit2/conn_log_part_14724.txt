Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
