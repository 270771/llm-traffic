Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 3 instances are observed targeting the same destination IP (52.237.221.62).  
- The first entry with ICMP type 8 is from 157.17.189.80 to 52.237.221.62, and two more similar entries follow from different source IPs, but the total count of ICMP type 8 packets is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The first log line shows ICMP type 133 from 113.252.133.112 to 133.102.112.228, which is not type 8 and thus irrelevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests at low volume.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate if any of the source IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- If more anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate accordingly.
