Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in a broader dataset to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in source/destination IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
