Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156), consistent with a volumetric ping flood pattern.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed source pattern typical of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs include multiple sources from 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges targeting 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other signs of coordinated DoS activity.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS protection services.
