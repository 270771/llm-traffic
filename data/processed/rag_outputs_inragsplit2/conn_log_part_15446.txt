Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 133.247.49.34) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalies and prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if the attack volume increases.
- Notify affected stakeholders and update incident response documentation to include this event.
