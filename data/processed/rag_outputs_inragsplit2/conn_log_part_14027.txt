Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.206.231.130, consistent with a ping flood pattern where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context means no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided; however, by standard practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources to one target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 133.247.80.53, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so this is standard).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.206.231.130.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for broader attack patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact.
