Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.9.51.14) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14; Destination IPs include 163.252.131.54, 163.252.245.247, 163.252.13.107, 163.252.13.123, 163.252.201.248, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal or external hosts targeted by these ICMP echo requests.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events.
- Consider deploying ICMP rate limiting or disabling ICMP echo requests if not required for legitimate network operations.
