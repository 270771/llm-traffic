Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from multiple source IPs (notably 133.16.14.149, 54.203.204.55, 54.135.122.13, and 52.194.220.98) targeting various destination IPs. This volume and pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 54.203.204.55, 54.135.122.13, 52.194.220.98
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 23.250.107.250, 23.229.216.8, 163.210.78.150, 203.114.135.69, among others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 133.16.14.149.
2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flooding and correlate with other logs to detect possible amplification or distributed sources.
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious IPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the attack closer to the source.
4. Conduct a forensic analysis on affected hosts to ensure no compromise or lateral movement occurred during the attack.
5. Update incident response playbooks to include automated detection and mitigation of ICMP flood attacks based on heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20, supported by both the anomaly record and the volume of ICMP type 8 traffic in the logs.
