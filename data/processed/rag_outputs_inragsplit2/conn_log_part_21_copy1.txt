Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the destination IP 54.239.183.175, indicating repeated ping requests consistent with a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies destination IP 54.239.183.175 as involved in an anomaly categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class for this anomaly is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which falls under the NetworkScanICMP category, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to 54.239.183.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type and repeated requests confirm the pattern.
- The traffic matches known ping flood patterns by exhibiting a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single destination, overwhelming the target with ping traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.239.183.175.
2. Investigate the source IP addresses (157.161.155.60, 157.161.155.250, 157.161.162.129, 157.161.71.225, 157.161.155.43, 157.161.162.8, 157.161.71.232) for potential compromise or malicious activity.
3. Deploy intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
5. Monitor network and host performance metrics on 54.239.183.175 for signs of degradation or service impact.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and classified under NetworkScanICMP taxonomy.
