Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- None of the Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request). All entries are TCP or UDP; no ICMP type 8 packets are present.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which appear here.
- The anomalies listed (heuristic 10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other unspecified anomalies, not ping floods.
- The heuristic taxonomy clarifies heuristic 10 is a SYN attack, which matches some TCP SYN flag entries in the logs, but no ICMP echo requests.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 (anomaly_782) further, as SYN floods can cause denial of service.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any other ICMP types are present that might indicate different ICMP-based attacks.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10) and other unspecified anomalies (heuristic 999).
