Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and only one ICMP echo request is logged, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are evident from the single connection record. Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (58.193.7.116) to the destination (203.78.197.30). If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for a potential ping flood attack. Also, investigate if these IPs have any prior history of suspicious activity.
