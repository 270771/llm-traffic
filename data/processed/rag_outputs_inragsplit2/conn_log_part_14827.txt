Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, 8, and 3.
- Only two instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (133.228.62.234, 139.179.133.57, 58.193.7.117) show repeated ICMP Echo Requests over time.
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics for better detection.
