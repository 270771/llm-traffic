Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, the total number of ICMP type 8 instances in the snippet is 8, which is below the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified in the data.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests without the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency or volume from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if any of the destination IPs report service degradation or network issues.
