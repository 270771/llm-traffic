Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 11, 3, and 0, but no entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- There are no instances of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic observed includes ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 0 (Echo Reply), none of which indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 could warrant further investigation into network issues or reconnaissance activity, but this is not conclusive of an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source or to the same destination.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious IPs or traffic patterns.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are legitimate network responses and not part of a broader reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempt.
