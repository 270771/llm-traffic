Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 0, 8, and 129. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (the first line: src 133.228.186.106 to dst 52.181.47.160).  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 129 = unknown or non-standard) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of OTH (other) connection states and ICMP traffic with types other than 8 suggests normal or unrelated ICMP activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if heuristic 20 (if available) or other heuristics apply.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.186.106 if it repeatedly sends ICMP type 8 packets in larger volumes.
