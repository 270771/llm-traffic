Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP (3.127.149.71), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no alternative taxonomy or heuristic can be assigned.

Next steps: Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from multiple source IPs to the same destination. If the count exceeds 10 or anomaly data becomes available, reassess for ping flood. Also, investigate if these ICMP requests correlate with any network performance degradation or alerts from other sensors.
