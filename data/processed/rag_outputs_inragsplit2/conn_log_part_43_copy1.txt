Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only 2 entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 52.26.24.28 and 13.43.166.59).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 instances is only 2, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (such as heuristic 20) are present to override this threshold.  
- The majority of ICMP traffic here is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or other types, which do not indicate a ping flood but could suggest other network issues or scanning activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no ping flood is detected, no immediate mitigation is required for ping flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of ICMP type 3 messages from 203.65.114.222, as this may indicate network scanning, misconfiguration, or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.  
- Apply heuristic 3 (commonly associated with ICMP unreachable messages) if available, to classify this behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns.
