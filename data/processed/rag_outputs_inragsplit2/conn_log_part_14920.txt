Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.198, and there is only one instance of it.  
- The other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics and taxonomy for better classification.
