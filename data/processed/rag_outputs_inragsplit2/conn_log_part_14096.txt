Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (54.193.126.151) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
  5. Conduct a forensic review to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts to inform further remediation.
