Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.238.213.5, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.140.121, 133.228.208.10, 133.228.217.204, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.238.213.5.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host and consider isolating it if service degradation occurs.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
