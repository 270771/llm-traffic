Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests is 8, and the log shows multiple ICMP type 8 packets targeting 52.236.221.123 from different source IPs.  
- However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- One ICMP packet with type 11 (time exceeded) is present but unrelated to ping flood detection.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to see if the volume crosses the threshold for ping flood detection.  
- Investigate the target IP 52.236.221.123 for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or performance issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
