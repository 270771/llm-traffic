Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IPs (primarily 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55). This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession to a single target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges, targeting destination IPs 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor for potential service degradation on the targeted hosts.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
  5. Conduct a deeper investigation to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
