Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the packet counts and sizes indicate very few ICMP echo requests (type 8) are present. The entries show 1, 12, and 2 packets respectively, none reaching the threshold of at least 10 instances consistently from the same source to the same destination.  
- The first entry has only 1 packet, the second 12 packets but spread across different destinations, and the third 2 packets. This does not constitute a flood pattern from a single source to a single destination.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports (heuristic 20 or others).  
- The traffic pattern resembles sporadic ICMP activity rather than a sustained flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP echo request counts from the same source to the same destination.  
- Collect ICMP type fields explicitly to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in threat intelligence feeds or show other suspicious behavior.
