Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 4 times targeting 35.173.100.241 (from IPs 133.247.86.51, 133.247.86.254, 133.247.107.195, 133.247.104.206).  
- The threshold for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- Other ICMP types (3 and 0) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window or checking for other suspicious traffic patterns.
