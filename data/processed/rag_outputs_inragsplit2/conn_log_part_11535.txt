Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple anomalous source IPs targeting a single destination with ICMP type 8) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.19.5, 133.247.71.173, 133.247.224.57, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation and consider isolating it if impact is severe.
  4. Conduct source IP reputation checks and coordinate with upstream providers to block or trace back malicious traffic.
  5. Review and update incident response plans to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
