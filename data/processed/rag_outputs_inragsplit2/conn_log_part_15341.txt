Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP traffic in the snippet shows types 128 and 11, neither of which is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and none are present here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.
- Investigate any future anomalies with heuristic 20 if such context becomes available.
