Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.254.250.38) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38; Destination IPs include 163.252.16.27, 163.252.147.143, 163.252.16.25, 163.252.126.216, and many others as listed.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on the targeted destination IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
