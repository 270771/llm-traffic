Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.238.213.5) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range flooding the destination IP 52.238.213.5. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host (52.238.213.5) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack volume escalates.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
