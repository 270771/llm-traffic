Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances (specifically 22) of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the same source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs, consistent with a volumetric ICMP flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 124.121.97.181
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 203.65.115.102, 163.21.102.221, 163.21.0.21, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if the source is external.
