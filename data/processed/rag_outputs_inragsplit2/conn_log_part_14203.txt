Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 189.112.133.75 and 35.173.100.241). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 11, 0, 128, and 129, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 0 (Echo Reply) are normal network behaviors.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
