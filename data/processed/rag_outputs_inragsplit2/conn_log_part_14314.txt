Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be type 8 (Echo Request).  
- In the snippet, multiple entries from source IP 3.89.103.26 show ICMP type 8 to various destinations, but there are only 5 such instances, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 0 and 11) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to multiple destinations.  
- Investigate the source IP 3.89.103.26 for unusual ICMP traffic volume if it persists or grows.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
