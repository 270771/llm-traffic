Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.86.31 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.179.246, 157.17.207.131, 157.17.68.47, 157.17.207.95, 157.17.9.52, and others are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 34.25.86.31 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 34.25.86.31.
- Notify network operations to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are part of a larger botnet or coordinated attack.
