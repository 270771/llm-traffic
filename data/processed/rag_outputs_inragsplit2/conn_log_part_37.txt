Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods. Specifically, there are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 18.24.178.88 to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.210.232.15, 163.210.183.6, 163.210.36.249, 163.210.17.249, 163.210.231.251, 163.210.170.22) within a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.

- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack. The anomaly record for source IP 133.16.14.149 is categorized as 'icmp_error' under heuristic 20, supporting the presence of suspicious ICMP traffic related to ping floods.

- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IP: 18.24.178.88 (primary attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple in the 163.210.x.x range
  - Additionally, suspicious IP 133.16.14.149 is noted in anomaly CSV with heuristic 20.

- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.24.178.88 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Block or throttle ICMP traffic from the identified attacker IP to prevent network degradation.
3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies from 133.16.14.149 and related IPs flagged by heuristic 20.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other hosts exhibiting similar ICMP flood behavior.
5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack source IP for potential upstream filtering.
6. Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood detection and mitigation steps.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and falls under the 'icmp_error' taxonomy class, indicating a denial-of-service attempt via ICMP Echo Requests.
