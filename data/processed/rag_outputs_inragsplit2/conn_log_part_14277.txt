Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these requests from multiple source IPs (all in the 133.247.x.x range) to the same destination IP strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 133.247.29.133, 133.247.129.177, 133.247.35.246, etc., all targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (157.187.159.183) for performance degradation and consider temporarily isolating it if service disruption occurs.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet and take appropriate remediation steps.
