Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with ICMP echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request Flood").
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.101.198, 163.252.215.105, 163.252.176.188, 163.252.171.193, 163.252.31.88, 163.252.255.109, 163.252.213.165, 163.252.64.5, 163.252.216.194, 163.252.254.9, 163.252.187.198, 163.252.255.180, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.216.148, 163.252.184.1, 163.252.215.185, 163.252.220.6.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
