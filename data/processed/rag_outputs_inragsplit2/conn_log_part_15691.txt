Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type present in the log entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping). However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (15.130.145.131) to different destination IPs. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (such as heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 202.194.17.63 to 80.137.31.56) is type 0 (echo reply) or unspecified, and does not contribute to a ping flood pattern.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The low volume and lack of repeated ICMP echo requests do not match typical flooding behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs have prior history of suspicious activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
