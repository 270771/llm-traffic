Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (50.239.214.145) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from different source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed source pattern consistent with a volumetric ICMP flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard detection heuristics for ping floods:
  - ICMP type 8 is required (confirmed).
  - At least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 are present (confirmed, >20).
- Assigning heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service" as the most likely labels based on common industry standards.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.228.56.38 through 133.228.252.62 (at least 20 unique IPs).
- Destination IP: 50.239.214.145
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor and log further ICMP traffic to the target IP for escalation.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or mitigate the flood if it persists.
- Consider deploying an ICMP flood-specific mitigation appliance or service.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
- Review and harden network devices to ignore or deprioritize ICMP Echo Requests during the attack window.
