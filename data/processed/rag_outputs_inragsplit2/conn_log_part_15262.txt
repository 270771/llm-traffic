Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 0 and 128, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over time.  
- Checking for other ICMP types that might indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data once available.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
