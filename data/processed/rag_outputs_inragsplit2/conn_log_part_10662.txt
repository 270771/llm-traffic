Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 0, 3, 8, and 10. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 3, 10) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) or type 10 (router solicitation) traffic if it persists or spikes.
