Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from source IP 69.47.68.36 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, as well as other source IPs (157.17.x.x) targeting 34.25.86.31.
- The volume and distribution of these ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends a high number of ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 69.47.68.36, 157.17.74.62, 157.17.98.30, 157.17.63.149, 157.17.212.69, 157.17.207.84
  - Destination IPs: 163.252.246.198, 163.252.9.146, 163.252.40.112, 163.252.233.86, 163.252.90.244, 163.252.47.183, 163.252.75.57, 163.252.125.154, 34.25.86.31, and others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 is consistent across all entries.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 69.47.68.36 and the 157.17.x.x range.
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
4. Notify affected network owners and coordinate with upstream providers to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if business operations allow.

This targeted response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood and reduce the risk of denial of service to the affected hosts.
