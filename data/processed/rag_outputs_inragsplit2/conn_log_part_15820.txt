Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries targeting 52.236.221.123 from various source IPs, the total count of such instances is 7, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs that would override this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the log snippet. The ICMP traffic appears to be isolated echo requests without signs of amplification or other protocol misuse.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the same destination IP. Investigate the source IPs (157.17.168.12, 157.17.168.48, 157.17.142.126, 157.17.162.69, 157.17.7.254, 157.17.168.26, 157.17.162.15) for any unusual behavior or reputation issues. If the count of ICMP echo requests rises above 10 or if anomaly data becomes available, reassess for ping flood conditions.
