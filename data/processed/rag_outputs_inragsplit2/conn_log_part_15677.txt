Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (the 7th column after source IP and port) shows values mostly as 3 or 11, which correspond to ICMP Destination Unreachable (type 3) and ICMP Time Exceeded (type 11), not Echo Request (type 8).  
- Only one record shows ICMP type 1 (Echo Reply), and none show type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.7.211, which appears frequently sending ICMP type 3 messages, to ensure it is not misconfigured or causing network issues.  
- Monitor for any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
