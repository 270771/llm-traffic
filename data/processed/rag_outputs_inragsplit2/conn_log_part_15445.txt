Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard detection heuristics, the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to the same destination IP strongly indicates a ping flood (heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.150.51, 157.17.150.37, 157.17.249.52, etc.) are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 16.161.126.169 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger distributed attack.
- Engage incident response to trace back the source IPs and assess if they are compromised hosts or spoofed.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood filters or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
