Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly used to identify ping floods. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the flooding nature of the traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and network performance.
  3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic persists or escalates.
