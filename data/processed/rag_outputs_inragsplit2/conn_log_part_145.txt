Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the 17th column (ICMP type/code). Here, the values are `2` and `1`, neither of which is `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- Additionally, there are only two ICMP entries total, which is below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic or anomaly data is present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types or suspicious behavior.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Checking for other ICMP types that might indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Gathering more comprehensive logs or anomaly data to identify subtle or emerging threats.
