Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (echo request) entry is a single instance between 133.228.185.129 and 52.236.221.123.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 128/129, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating known suspicious IPs or behavior.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.185.129 for any unusual activity if more ICMP echo requests appear.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
