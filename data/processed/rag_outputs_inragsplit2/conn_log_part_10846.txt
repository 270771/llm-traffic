Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with ICMP types that indicate destination unreachable (type 3) and time exceeded (type 11), not echo requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomalies are indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic and volume spikes is recommended as a next step to detect potential future ping floods.
