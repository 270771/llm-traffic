Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets without known exceptions. This condition is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.49.6, 133.247.59.152, 133.247.86.24, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the attack traffic.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
