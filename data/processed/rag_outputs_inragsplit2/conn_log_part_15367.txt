Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present in the log are mostly 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), with no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries.  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are fewer than 10 instances of type 8 (in fact, none), the traffic does not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may be normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correspond to legitimate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
