Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet count is minimal.

No other attack type is evident from this single log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly context, this traffic does not meet criteria for a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (52.42.116.124) to the destination (163.252.71.171). If counts exceed 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood activity. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
