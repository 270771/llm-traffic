Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97 is the attacker; multiple destination IPs (e.g., 203.65.127.196, 163.21.151.229, 203.65.118.168, etc.) are potential victims.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
