Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.127.34.186 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) from many sources to a single destination in rapid succession.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.247.x.x range, targeting destination IP 35.127.34.186. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 35.127.34.186.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods and prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if attack volume increases.
  5. Ensure the target host has ICMP flood mitigation enabled (e.g., firewall rules, ICMP rate limiting).
