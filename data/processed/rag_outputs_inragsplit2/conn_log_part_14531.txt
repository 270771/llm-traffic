Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.48, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the Echo Request used in ping floods, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.81.162, 133.247.81.90, 133.247.109.57, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 69.47.68.48 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target IP 69.47.68.48 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Notify network operations and consider upstream filtering with the ISP to mitigate the flood.
  5. Implement ICMP rate limiting and logging to detect future floods early.
