Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections with no indication of ICMP type 8 packets or repeated ICMP echo requests.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies; they mostly indicate SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999).  
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping floods, but it is not present in the anomalies.  

No other attack type matching the current data is evident beyond SYN flood attempts (heuristic 10, taxonomy 'ptmp') related to TCP SYN flags on suspicious ports.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by correlating connection attempts from IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74 to determine if a SYN flood or port scan is ongoing.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Validate firewall and IDS rules to ensure SYN flood protections are active and tuned.
