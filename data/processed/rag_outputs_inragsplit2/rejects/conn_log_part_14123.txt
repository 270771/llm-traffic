Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these packets are part of a known attack pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 11 packets could be normal network diagnostic or routing-related messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
