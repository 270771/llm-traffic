Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) entries. All entries are TCP or UDP, and the protocol field does not indicate ICMP type 8.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in any anomaly records.
- The anomalies listed relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10), heavy hitters (heuristic 12 and 999), and other suspicious TCP connections, but none correspond to ICMP ping flood activity.
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping floods, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are present here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomalies with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 12 (FIN attack) further, as these indicate potential TCP-based DoS or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Confirm if any hosts involved in anomalies (e.g., 89.3.89.164, 185.58.127.74) are exhibiting suspicious behavior beyond TCP anomalies.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with TCP SYN flood or scanning heuristics (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter detection (heuristic 12).
