Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and other categories unrelated to ICMP.  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood detection, which is absent here.

No other attack type matching the ping flood pattern is evident. The anomalies mostly relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), indicating possible TCP-based scanning or flooding but not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the TCP SYN anomalies further, especially those flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack), to confirm if a SYN flood or scanning is occurring.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to catch ping floods early.
