Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times from the source IP 69.47.68.36 to different destination IPs (133.251.112.237, 133.251.112.215, 133.251.113.41). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are not type 8 and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and other ICMP messages.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 69.47.68.36 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
