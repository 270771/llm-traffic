Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 1, 3, and 8. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (1 and 3) do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not part of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
