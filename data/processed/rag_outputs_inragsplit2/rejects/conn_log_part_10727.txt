Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, which are normal in traceroute or routing scenarios, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and their frequency to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in other ICMP types if they persist.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
