Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 150.245.195.198 and 133.228.120.184). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 128/129, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 128/129 (ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply) is normal network behavior and does not imply flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the two IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if their volume increases or if other anomalies appear.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
