Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and increased frequency from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-volume or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
