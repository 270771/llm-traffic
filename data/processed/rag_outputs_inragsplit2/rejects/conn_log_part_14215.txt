Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 14 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting two destination IPs: 52.158.11.176 and 3.121.216.42.
- The volume and distribution of these ICMP echo requests from many different source IPs to the same destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ping floods) by inference, as multiple sources are targeting the same destination IPs with ICMP type 8.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.173.124, 157.17.200.202, 157.17.188.178, etc.)
- Destination IPs: 52.158.11.176 and 3.121.216.42
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
