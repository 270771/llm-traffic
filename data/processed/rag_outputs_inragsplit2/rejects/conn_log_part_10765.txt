Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 44.53.133.97 to various destination IPs within a very short time frame, totaling at least 7 distinct entries just from this source alone. Including other sources, there are more than 10 ICMP type 8 instances overall.
- ICMP type 8 is the Echo Request used in ping operations, and a high volume of these requests in a short period matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.53.133.97 is the primary attacker sending multiple ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs (163.252.124.254, 163.252.124.145, 163.252.181.170, 163.252.181.247, 163.252.124.140, 163.252.81.207). Other sources sending ICMP type 8 include 5.85.36.45 and 124.103.155.165.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the nature of the traffic.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 44.53.133.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from other sources and implement threshold-based alerts.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in the attack.
- Engage incident response to investigate the source host for signs of compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services to protect critical infrastructure.
- Document and report the incident according to organizational policies.
