Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1, 8, and 11. Only one entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), and it appears only once.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) entries do not constitute flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or match known threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
