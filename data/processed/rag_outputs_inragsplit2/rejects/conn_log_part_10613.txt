Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries provided are TCP or UDP connections; none show ICMP traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present in the snippet.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.
- The only anomaly noted (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, indicating a SYN flood or similar TCP-based attack, not ICMP ping flood.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve abnormal SYN packets causing resource exhaustion.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 likely refers to partial or temporary anomalies related to TCP SYN floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.
- Collect and analyze ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
