Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP type in the snippet, far below the threshold of 10 required for ping flood detection.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. Given the single ICMP type 1 message, this could be a normal network error or diagnostic message rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if further logs show repeated ICMP type 1 messages that might indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
