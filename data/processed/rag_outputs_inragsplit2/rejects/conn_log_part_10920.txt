Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and other suspicious connections, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 is a catch-all for other suspicious anomalies.
- No heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is triggered here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood indicated by heuristic 10 (anomaly_782) from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if the SYN flood is causing service degradation and consider rate limiting or firewall rules to mitigate it.
