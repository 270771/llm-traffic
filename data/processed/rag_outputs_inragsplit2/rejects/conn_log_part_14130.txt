Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic present shows types 3 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack pattern is evident from the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or multiple repeated packets, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if additional logs show ICMP type 8 traffic or increased volume from these IPs.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) if such context becomes available.  
- Review other protocol logs for suspicious activity since no anomalies are currently flagged.
