Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
