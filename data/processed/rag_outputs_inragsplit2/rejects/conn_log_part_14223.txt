Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances total, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a volumetric ICMP flood, as the count is minimal and no repeated or sustained traffic is evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Correlate with other network or host-based alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.
