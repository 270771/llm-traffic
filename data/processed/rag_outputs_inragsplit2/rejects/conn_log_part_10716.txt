Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 69.47.68.36 to 163.252.71.123).
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if the source IP 69.47.68.36 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
