Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 uses ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The only ICMP type 8 traffic is from 163.76.120.97, which shows multiple echo requests to various destinations, but the total count of these type 8 packets is fewer than 10 instances in the snippet.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the CSV.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) from a single source to a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 messages suggest normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source 163.76.120.97 for unusual scanning or reconnaissance activity, as it sends multiple ICMP echo requests to diverse IPs, which could indicate probing behavior.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
