Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP packets or types are logged here.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, but no such heuristic or matching anomaly is found in the data.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm if ICMP logging is enabled and functioning correctly to capture relevant traffic for ping flood detection.
