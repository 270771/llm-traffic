Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks. The ICMP types present are 1, 13, 0, and others, none of which correspond to ping requests.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, zero instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP traffic appears normal or unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if ICMP type 8 traffic increases or if anomalies appear in future logs.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known indicators once heuristic context is available.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly sources to detect different attack types.
