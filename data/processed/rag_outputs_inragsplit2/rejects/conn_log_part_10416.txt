Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.184.106, 133.247.117.40, 133.247.19.126, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.178.233.150 and 69.47.68.36), indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches were found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this fits the classic ping flood heuristic (likely heuristic 1 or 2 in common taxonomies related to ICMP flood attacks).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and 202.194.17.61 (though the latter sends ICMP type 0, not type 8).
- Destinations: Primarily 54.178.233.150 and 69.47.68.36.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting persistent offending source IPs at firewall or router level.
- Conduct a network traffic baseline analysis to identify any other unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases.
