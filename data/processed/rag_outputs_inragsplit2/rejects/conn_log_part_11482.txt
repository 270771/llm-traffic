Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connections are isolated ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or other suspicious behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (130.197.151.24, 130.197.60.23, 130.197.151.3) or destinations (3.209.176.135, 173.97.102.149) appear in future anomaly reports or show unusual traffic patterns.
