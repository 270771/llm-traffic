Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 0, 1, 1, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found).  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly records, the traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same IPs.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging threats.
