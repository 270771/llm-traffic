Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but there is only 1 instance of type 8 (from 51.121.111.183 to 133.102.229.199). The other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, but no heuristic or anomaly data is available here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports are flagged.  
- The traffic does not match the pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination that would indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly records.
