Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the flooding nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 54.178.233.150; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3 protocol.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the target IP 54.178.233.150.
- Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic if the attack volume is large.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and verify if other hosts are targeted similarly.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider temporary blocking or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from a known malicious region or entity.
