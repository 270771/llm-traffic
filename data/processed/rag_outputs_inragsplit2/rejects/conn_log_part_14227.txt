Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port activity, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets, absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing TCP SYN flood patterns on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080.  
- Enable or check ICMP-specific logging to capture potential ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs to detect emerging ping flood attempts.
