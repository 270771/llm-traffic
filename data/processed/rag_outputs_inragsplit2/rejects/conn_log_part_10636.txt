Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) between 133.247.237.137 and 103.254.165.56. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or related anomalies, this traffic appears to be normal or benign ICMP activity.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. If multiple such entries accumulate rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
