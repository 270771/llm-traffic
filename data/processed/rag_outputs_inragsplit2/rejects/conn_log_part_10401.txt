Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and other suspicious connections, not ping floods.

The anomalies detected correspond to:
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack (ptmp category)
- Heuristic 999: Other suspicious activity on unknown ports (heavy_hitter, mptmp categories)

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if the suspicious TCP traffic is part of a larger scanning or DoS attempt.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood or scanning activity per heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (other suspicious).
