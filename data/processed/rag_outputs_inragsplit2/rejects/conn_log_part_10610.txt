Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets; the ICMP type field is missing or not specified as 8.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
