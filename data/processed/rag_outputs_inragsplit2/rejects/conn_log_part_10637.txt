Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one occurrence is logged. Since no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are present and the count is far below the threshold of 10, this does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed ICMP type and count data, and monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests from or to these IPs to rule out emerging ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
