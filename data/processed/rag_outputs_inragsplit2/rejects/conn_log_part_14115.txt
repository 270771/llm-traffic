Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood packet.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), also not type 8.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, both of types other than 8, and far fewer than the required minimum of 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No known heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here due to lack of data and absence of ping flood indicators.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.109.57 sending ICMP type 1 packets, which may indicate network issues or misconfigurations but not a ping flood.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
