Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `157.17.104.217` to `67.153.72.32` with a single instance, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry from `133.228.62.233` to `159.0.137.47` is type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8, so it does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP `133.228.62.233` sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual, as it may indicate network issues or traceroute activity.
