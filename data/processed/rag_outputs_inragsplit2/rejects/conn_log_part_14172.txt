Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 1, 3, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and no anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.
- The entries show ICMP types related to destination unreachable (type 3), echo reply (type 0), and possibly destination unreachable (type 1), which may indicate network issues or scanning but not flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data.

Next steps:
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 1 messages to rule out network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
