Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 is Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets could be related to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a pattern of repeated ICMP type 11 packets that might indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to check for ICMP type 8 floods or other anomalies.  
- Enable heuristic detection for ICMP floods once heuristic context is available.
