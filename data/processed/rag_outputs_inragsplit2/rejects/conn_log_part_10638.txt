Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are only 3 entries with ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types present (1 and 3) do not correspond to ping requests and thus do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) suggests normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (e.g., 157.17.175.183, 157.17.179.252, 157.17.179.246) show repeated ICMP Echo Requests over time.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
