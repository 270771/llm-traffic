Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present here. The ICMP type 3 message typically indicates normal network error reporting rather than an attack. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate security response is warranted. Further monitoring of ICMP echo requests and volume from these IPs could be done to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
