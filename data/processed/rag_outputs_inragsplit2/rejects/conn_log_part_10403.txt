Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 133.247.17.27 to 18.22.151.10, and it appears only once in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets is normal in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.17.27 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
