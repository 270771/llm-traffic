Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (54.186.116.19) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches the classic ping flood behavior where an attacker sends numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.186.116.19; Destination IPs include 163.252.52.6, 163.252.201.253, 163.252.115.79, 163.252.115.93, 163.252.201.198, 163.252.115.15, 163.252.20.57, 163.252.255.236, 163.252.82.193.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.186.116.19 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential impact on targeted hosts.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or DDoS protection services.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks in the future.
