Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records or types are visible.
- None of the anomalies in the CSV relate to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The anomalies present mostly relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and other suspicious TCP traffic on known or unknown ports.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches anomalies involving SYN flags and suspicious TCP ports.
- No evidence of ICMP echo request floods or repeated ICMP type 8 packets is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
- Continue monitoring anomalies related to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) as they may indicate other DoS attempts.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected based on the provided data. The current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10), which stands for SYN attack taxonomy.
