Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.47.68.36) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the flooding nature.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.58.32, 133.247.164.194, 133.247.44.83, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.47.68.36. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host (69.47.68.36) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and apply network-wide ICMP flood protections.
