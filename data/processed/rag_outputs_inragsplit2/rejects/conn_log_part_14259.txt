Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present here. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate investigation is warranted for ping flood activity. If further analysis is desired, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP over a short period would be the next step.
