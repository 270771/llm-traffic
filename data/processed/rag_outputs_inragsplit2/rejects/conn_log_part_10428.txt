Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the IP 54.178.233.150, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet and 44.51.211.229 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.178.233.150. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 54.178.233.150 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting persistent attacking IPs and investigate upstream providers for possible mitigation.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
