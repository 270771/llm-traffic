Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood. The provided conn.log entries show ICMP traffic but do not specify type 8.  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with 32 packets but no explicit ICMP type 8 indicated.  
- The second entry shows only 1 packet and no ICMP type 8 indication.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.  
- The volume and type of ICMP traffic do not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood detection.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields explicitly in the logs to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
