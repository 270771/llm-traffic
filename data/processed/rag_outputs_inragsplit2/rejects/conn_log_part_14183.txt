Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as ping flood traffic. The provided Zeek conn.log entries do not specify ICMP type 8; the fields indicating ICMP type are either missing or show values inconsistent with type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic in the snippet, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and no repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination are evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs to confirm traffic types.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding threshold counts.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs or similar traffic patterns.
