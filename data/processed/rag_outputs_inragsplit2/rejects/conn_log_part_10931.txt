Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) do not match typical flood or DoS patterns here.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Investigate the source IPs if they appear in other logs with suspicious activity.
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
