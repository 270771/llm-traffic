Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting two main destination IPs: 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to the same destinations match the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is triggered by at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets without known benign exceptions.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions), which relates to suspicious ICMP echo request floods.
- Taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to overwhelming ICMP echo requests aiming to saturate the target.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.175.21, 133.247.51.186, 133.247.228.1, etc.)
- Destinations: 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known to be malicious.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential compromised hosts within the source IP range and remediate accordingly.
