Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present here. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination over time to detect potential ping floods.
