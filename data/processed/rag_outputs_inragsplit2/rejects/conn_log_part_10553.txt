Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). The anomalies relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (unknown/mptmp), neither of which indicate ping flood activity.
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080, as SYN attacks can be precursors or part of other DoS attempts.
- Also review the anomaly with heuristic 999 on destination IP 45.136.197.42 port 46280 for potential multi-port scanning or other suspicious activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts, as current data lacks ICMP records.

No ping flood is detected; the heuristics and taxonomy confirm the current anomalies relate to SYN and unknown multi-port suspicious traffic, not ICMP ping floods.
