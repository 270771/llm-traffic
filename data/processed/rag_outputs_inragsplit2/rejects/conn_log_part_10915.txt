Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed, but monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs could be prudent.
