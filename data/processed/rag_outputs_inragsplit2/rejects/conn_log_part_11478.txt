Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only twice (from 46.150.208.137 to 133.251.201.196 and from 159.171.76.118 to 203.78.187.167). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3 and 0) are present, which are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets may be normal network behavior or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if any network performance issues coincide with these ICMP packets.
