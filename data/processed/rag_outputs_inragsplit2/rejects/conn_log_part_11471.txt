Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance present is zero; the first log entry shows ICMP type 8 in the source port field, but the actual ICMP type field is 19 (not 8). The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is the minimum threshold for detecting a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if more comprehensive logs show repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types.  
- Correlate with other network logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential stealthy or low-rate ICMP attacks.
