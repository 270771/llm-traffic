Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, which are normal in traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in related network segments.
