Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (4th column) shows values 11, 3, and 8 in the entries. Only type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 from source IP 69.47.68.48 to two different destinations, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest exceptions or known suspicious IPs that would lower the threshold.  
- Other ICMP types present (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies are flagged and the traffic volume is low, no immediate security incident is detected.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic for increased echo request volume.  
- Investigate if the source IP 69.47.68.48 is known for suspicious activity in other logs.  
- If more ICMP type 8 packets appear rapidly from the same source, reassess for ping flood conditions.
