Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other unknown anomalies, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 is an unspecified or unknown anomaly.
- No evidence of ICMP-based anomalies or ping flood heuristics (20) is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood anomaly (heuristic 10) from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood attack.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.
