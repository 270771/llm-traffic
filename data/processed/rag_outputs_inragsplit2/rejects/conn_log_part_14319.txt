Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 corresponds to "Router Advertisement," which are normal ICMP message types and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests, especially if counts exceed 10 or if heuristic 20 (if known) applies.  
- Collect more detailed heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
