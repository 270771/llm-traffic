Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) must be 8. In the provided logs, only two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (fields 4 or 6), but these are isolated single instances, not at least 10 occurrences as required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (0 and 11) do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination in volume or frequency indicative of flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) and type 0 (echo reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with broader network logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs have been flagged elsewhere.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in volume over time.
