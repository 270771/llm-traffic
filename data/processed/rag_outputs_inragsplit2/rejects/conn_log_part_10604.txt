Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The single ICMP record shows no ICMP type field explicitly, but the Zeek conn.log snippet indicates only one ICMP connection with no count of multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The ICMP traffic here is minimal and does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming a target.

No other attack type is indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP echo request volume from these IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior suspicious activity in other logs.
