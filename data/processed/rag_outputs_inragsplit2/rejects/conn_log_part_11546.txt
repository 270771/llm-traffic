Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 6th field (counting from 1), which shows values 1 and 10, but not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping). Here, type 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable) and type 10 (ICMP type 10 = Router Advertisement) are present, none are type 8.  
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are observed, the traffic does not match the required condition for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP control messages or other ICMP types, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior or other anomalies in different logs.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that meet the threshold of 10 or more instances.  
- If other ICMP types are causing issues, consider analyzing their context separately.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and no ping flood indicators.
