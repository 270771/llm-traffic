Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 45.32.19.188 and 203.78.166.215, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or alternative heuristics.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any new anomaly records or heuristics become available that might reclassify this traffic.
