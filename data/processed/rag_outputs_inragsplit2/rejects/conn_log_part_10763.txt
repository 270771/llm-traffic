Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 1 (indicated by the 6th and 10th fields in the log snippet), which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Checking for other ICMP types that might indicate scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data once available.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is present, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
