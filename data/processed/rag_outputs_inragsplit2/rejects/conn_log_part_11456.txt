Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly flags, this traffic appears normal or unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 if it becomes available.
