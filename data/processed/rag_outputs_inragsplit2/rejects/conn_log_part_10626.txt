Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or sustained ICMP traffic is evident.

No other attack patterns are indicated by this single entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 194.87.23.249. If multiple such packets appear in a short time frame, reevaluate for potential ping flood activity.
