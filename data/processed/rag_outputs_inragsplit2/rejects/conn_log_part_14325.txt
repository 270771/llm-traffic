Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries at all; all records are TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or the logs.
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic, not ICMP or ping flood.
- Therefore, no ping flood pattern is matched.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Confirm if any other ICMP traffic appears in extended logs to rule out stealthy ICMP-based attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' indicates partial or incomplete connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
