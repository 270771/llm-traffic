Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; all listed heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) or 999 (other suspicious).
- The heuristic context confirms that heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which is absent here.

Other observations:
- Multiple anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter anomalies (heuristic 999), indicating possible SYN flood or scanning activity.
- The anomaly taxonomy classes such as 'ptmp' (heuristic 10) indicate SYN attack patterns, which should be investigated further.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) for potential SYN flood or port scanning.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to reassess ping flood status.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected based on the current data. The focus should be on SYN-related anomalies and gathering ICMP-specific logs for comprehensive analysis.
