Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one occurrence is logged. Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as type 8 (echo request), and the count is far below the threshold of 10 instances, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type details in more granular logs to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests from the source IP 133.228.141.228 to destination 192.15.192.124 to detect any emerging ping flood patterns.
