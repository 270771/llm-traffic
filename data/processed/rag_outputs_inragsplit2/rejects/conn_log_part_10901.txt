Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the conn.log snippet are 0, 1, 3, 11, and 13, but none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise or indicate known suspicious IPs related to heuristic 20.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable), 3 (Source Quench), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 13 (Timestamp) suggests normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from or to suspicious IPs.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, correlate with IPs in the logs for deeper analysis.
