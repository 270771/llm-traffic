Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets directed toward a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (157.17.71.162, 157.17.71.229, 157.17.161.227, 157.17.5.195, 157.17.5.193, 157.17.5.196, 157.17.55.45, 157.17.161.190) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network traffic analysis to identify if the destination host is impacted and isolate it if necessary.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to monitor for further escalation or lateral movement.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
