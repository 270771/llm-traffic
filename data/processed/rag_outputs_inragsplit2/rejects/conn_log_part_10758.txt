Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance appears once (second log line), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The first log line shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential volumetric ICMP traffic spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs or ICMP types.
