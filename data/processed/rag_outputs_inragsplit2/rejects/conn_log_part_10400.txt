Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 78.116.131.140 to destination 203.78.185.125, with a count of 30 packets. This meets the minimum count threshold of 10 for potential ping flood.  
- However, there is only one such source-destination pair with ICMP type 8 traffic; no multiple repeated instances or multiple sources flooding the same target are evident.  
- Other ICMP entries are of types 11 and 128, which are not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold or indicate an attack.  
- The single instance of 30 packets over a short time (0.008122 seconds) is not sufficient evidence alone to confirm a ping flood attack without additional corroborating data such as multiple sources, sustained high volume, or known malicious IPs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and 128 (Echo Reply) entries appear normal and unrelated to flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic from multiple sources or to the same destination.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious IPs or heuristic matches.  
- Investigate the source IP 78.116.131.140 for any unusual behavior or reputation issues.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
