Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the IP 54.193.88.34 from various source IPs (210.122.60.180, 210.122.62.126, 210.122.63.254, 210.122.63.39, 210.122.61.236, 210.122.61.86, 210.122.62.1). There are at least 8 distinct ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests.
- Although the exact count is slightly below 10 in this snippet, the clustering of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from different sources to the same destination strongly matches a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic rules for ping flood detection, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests targeting a single host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Target IP 54.193.88.34; multiple source IPs from the 210.122.x.x subnet.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.193.88.34.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood (210.122.60.180, 210.122.62.126, 210.122.63.254, 210.122.63.39, 210.122.61.236, 210.122.61.86, 210.122.62.1).
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to detect possible amplification or coordinated attacks.
- Notify the affected host owner and prepare for potential escalation if service disruption occurs.
