Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (commonly associated with heuristic 20 in many frameworks, which flags high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources).
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.225.6, 157.17.55.80, 157.17.107.211, etc.) all targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.237.221.62.
- Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the attack.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to detect possible coordinated DDoS activity.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying upstream DDoS mitigation services if the attack escalates.
