Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with different types, and fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-volume or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 and 10 traffic if unusual patterns emerge.
