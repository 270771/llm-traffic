Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 packets from source IP 18.112.90.42 to different destination IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate network diagnostics or low-volume scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this source IP.  
- Investigate if 18.112.90.42 is authorized to send ICMP traffic to these destinations.  
- Collect more data to determine if a pattern of flooding emerges.
