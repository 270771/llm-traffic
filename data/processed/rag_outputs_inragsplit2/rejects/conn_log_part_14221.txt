Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two connections from 157.17.67.58 and 157.17.53.13 to 52.158.11.176, which is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3, 13, and 129, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) messages may be normal network behavior or unrelated anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 13 messages if unusual patterns emerge.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
