Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 1, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the given data, no immediate security action specific to ping floods is warranted. Further investigation could include monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for related anomalies.
