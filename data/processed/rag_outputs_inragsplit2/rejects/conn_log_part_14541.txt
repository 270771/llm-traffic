Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 distinct ICMP type 8 entries targeting the same destination IPs (notably 3.118.117.235 and 157.187.159.183) within a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests strongly indicate a ping flood attack (heuristic 20 typically relates to known anomalous IPs, which are absent here).
- Involved IPs include multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.12.190, 157.17.12.185, 133.247.38.1) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 3.118.117.235 and 157.187.159.183. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
