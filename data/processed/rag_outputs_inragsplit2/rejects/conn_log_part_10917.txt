Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 2 (as indicated by the field with value "2" in the 18th column), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, which is well below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other types of attacks. The ICMP type 2 corresponds to "ICMP Destination Unreachable" messages, which may indicate network issues but not a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 2 messages to determine if there are network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies that might indicate evolving attack patterns.
