Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single entry from 35.183.65.24 to 163.252.125.39.
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if 35.183.65.24 or 163.252.125.39 appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
