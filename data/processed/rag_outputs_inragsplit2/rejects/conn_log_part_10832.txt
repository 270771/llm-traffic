Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 133.247.75.118 to 35.183.65.24, and it appears only once.
- Other ICMP entries are type 1 (Echo Reply) and type 128 (ICMPv6 Echo Request), but the ICMPv6 traffic is not relevant for classic ICMP ping flood detection here.
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source).

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) connection state and low packet counts suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly records.
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
