Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 60.44.0.233 to destination 35.178.130.184, and there is only one such instance.  
- Other ICMP entries are types 1 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 instance if it recurs or is part of a pattern with other suspicious activity.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
