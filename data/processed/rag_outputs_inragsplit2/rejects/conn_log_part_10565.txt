Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.181.47.160 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- Although the count is 9 (just under 10), the volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to multiple targets strongly indicate a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.181.47.160; Destination IPs include 133.251.200.62, 133.251.210.62, 133.251.200.3, 133.251.208.57, 133.251.201.158, 133.251.203.84, 133.251.201.198, 133.251.203.39, 133.251.201.197; ICMP type 8, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- The entry from 202.194.17.63 is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), unrelated to ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.181.47.160 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., rate limiting, anomaly detection).
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks in the future.
