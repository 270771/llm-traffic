Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting two destination IPs: 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150. This volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic data were provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.22.227, 133.247.107.195, 133.247.72.62, etc.)
  - Destination IPs: 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within your network.
