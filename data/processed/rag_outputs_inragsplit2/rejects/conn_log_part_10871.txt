Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or volumetric attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, this traffic is normal ICMP echo request activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity once anomaly data or heuristics become available.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential escalation into flooding behavior.
