Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references an anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP (89.3.89.164) and port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

The heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets, which is consistent with the anomaly record but unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 further, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if any ICMP traffic is being filtered or logged elsewhere to ensure visibility.

No ping flood attack is detected in the provided data.
