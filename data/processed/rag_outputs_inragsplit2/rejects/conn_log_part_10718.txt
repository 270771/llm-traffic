Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with types indicating Destination Unreachable (3) and Time Exceeded (11), which do not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.

No attack is present based on the given data. The observed ICMP traffic likely represents normal network error messages rather than an attack. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes (Echo Requests) to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
