Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp Request), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since ICMP type 3 and 13 are normal control messages, no immediate threat is detected.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.  
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, re-evaluate accordingly.
