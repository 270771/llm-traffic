Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 203.78.177.156 to 135.218.43.249). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods but could be related to other network issues or scanning activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The single ICMP Echo Request is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Collect more data to confirm if any heuristic 20 or other anomaly patterns emerge.
