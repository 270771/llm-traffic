Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present in the snippet (from 157.17.63.180 to 52.158.11.176).  
- The other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and 11 (time exceeded) messages may indicate normal network troubleshooting or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or failures.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
