Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood consideration. Only two entries have ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic volume and frequency in the snippet are insufficient to indicate a flood or DoS condition.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs (157.17.169.110 and 157.17.150.7) for any unusual behavior or reputation issues.
