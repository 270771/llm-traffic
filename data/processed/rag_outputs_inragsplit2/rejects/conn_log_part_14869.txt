Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) directed primarily at the destination IP 18.101.165.68 from various source IPs (e.g., 133.247.41.182, 133.247.61.247, 133.247.184.57, 133.247.184.87, 133.247.123.98, 133.247.246.155, 133.247.151.121). There are at least 8 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the clustering of multiple unique sources sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same target strongly suggests coordinated flooding.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard heuristics for ping flood detection, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IP 18.101.165.68. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the target host 18.101.165.68 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or filtering malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis of the affected host and network to identify any collateral impact or compromise.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
