Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 1 (ICMP Echo Reply), not type 8 (ICMP Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 and 1 messages are normal network control messages and do not inherently indicate an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 3 messages that might indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Collect more detailed heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
