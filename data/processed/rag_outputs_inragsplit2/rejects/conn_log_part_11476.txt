Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single entry from 203.78.177.156 to 107.170.162.62.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets observed, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or related to other network issues, but not a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests, as it could be a misconfigured host or a precursor to an attack.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
