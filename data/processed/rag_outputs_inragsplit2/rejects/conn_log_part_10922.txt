Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `61.1.51.193` to `18.93.7.87` with a single instance. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are of types 0, 1, 3, and 11, which do not correspond to ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of various ICMP types may be normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source to a destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP `61.1.51.193` if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
