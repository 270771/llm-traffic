Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 1 (ICMP type field is 1), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets, this single ICMP type 1 packet does not match ping flood criteria. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 1 corresponds to an ICMP Destination Unreachable or other control message, which is not indicative of a flood.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP could be a next step if suspicious activity arises.
