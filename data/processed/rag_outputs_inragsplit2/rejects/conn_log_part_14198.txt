Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the IP 54.253.0.94 targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.009 seconds each), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.253.0.94 is flooding multiple destination IPs (133.251.208.57, 133.251.200.33, 133.251.200.50, 133.251.201.198, 133.251.201.194, 133.251.210.62, 133.251.203.166).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.253.0.94 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Investigate whether the targeted IPs are internal assets and assess impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or DDoS protection services.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
