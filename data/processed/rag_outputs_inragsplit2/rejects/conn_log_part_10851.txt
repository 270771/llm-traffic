Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.29, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the volume (10 instances) meets the threshold for detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches a classic ICMP Echo Request flood (ping flood) heuristic, typically associated with heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (130.197.172.119, 130.197.172.118, 130.197.154.26, 130.197.25.173, 130.197.61.3, 130.197.21.129, 130.197.136.57, 130.197.160.4, 153.156.84.171) targeting destination IP 69.47.68.29 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type and destination IP indicate coordinated flooding.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 69.47.68.29 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the destination host for service impact and consider temporary isolation if service degradation is detected.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems and update firewall rules accordingly.
