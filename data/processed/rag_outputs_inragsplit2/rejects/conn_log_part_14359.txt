Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 198.110.39.18 to destination 163.252.188.202, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.  
- The other ICMP entries are types 0, 3, and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No source or destination IPs appear repeatedly with ICMP type 8 to meet the threshold of at least 10 instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or require separate investigation but do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 198.110.39.18 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
