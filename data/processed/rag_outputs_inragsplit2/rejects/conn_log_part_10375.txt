Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting a single destination IP 52.181.47.160 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.228.x.x range and 69.47.68.36, all targeting destination IP 52.181.47.160 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.47.160.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attempts.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP ranges that may be participating in the attack.
  5. Prepare incident response to handle potential service degradation or denial of service on the targeted host.
