Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two: one from 133.247.49.34 to 184.245.107.196, and one from 133.247.129.151 to 47.251.187.120. This is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 10, 11) do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if network connectivity issues are suspected.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
