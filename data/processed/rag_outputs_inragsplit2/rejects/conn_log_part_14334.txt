Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to various destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are at least 8 distinct ICMP type 8 entries within a very short time window (~0.008 seconds each), indicating rapid repeated pings consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the volume and rapid succession strongly suggest a ping flood, especially since no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override the threshold.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available, so by default, this matches the general heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP: Source 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs (163.252.103.254, 163.252.103.166, 163.252.84.62, 163.252.20.100, 163.252.20.32, 163.252.252.126, 163.252.239.177).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
