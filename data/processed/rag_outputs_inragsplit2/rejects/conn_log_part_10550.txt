Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or a higher volume of ICMP traffic, this does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based DoS patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 packets are part of legitimate traceroute or network diagnostic activity.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
