Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 8, 128, and 3 again. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (at timestamp 1641099663.081550 from 176.110.72.46 to 133.251.89.126). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 128 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 176.110.72.46 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
