Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 20 specifically stands for ping flood, which is absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, as indicated by anomaly_782.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if the heavy hitter anomaly (heuristic 999) from 133.251.127.196 requires further investigation for volumetric attacks other than ping floods.
