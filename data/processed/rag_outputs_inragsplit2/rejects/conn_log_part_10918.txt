Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies.
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 10 (SYN attack) indicates suspicious TCP SYN traffic, which matches the many TCP connections with SYN flags (S0 state) in the log.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood potential indicated by heuristic 10 anomalies, as multiple TCP connections show SYN flags without completion.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect ping floods.
- Verify if the heavy hitter anomaly (heuristic 999) on port 1433 (commonly MS SQL) is legitimate or a sign of scanning or brute force.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood or scanning activity (heuristic 10: SYN attack, taxonomy 'ptmp'). Further investigation should focus on TCP SYN anomalies and heavy hitter behavior.
