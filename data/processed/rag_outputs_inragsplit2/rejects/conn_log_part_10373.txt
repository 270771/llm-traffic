Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting a single destination IP 52.181.47.160 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.234.57, 133.228.191.249, 133.228.165.200, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.181.47.160 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 52.181.47.160 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts part of a botnet and initiate remediation.
