Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 177.96.38.62, with a single instance logged.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override this threshold.  
- Other ICMP types present (11 and 3) are not type 8 and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or related anomalies in network behavior.
