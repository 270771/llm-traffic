Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only four ICMP connections with type 8 (echo request), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower this threshold.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 traffic, especially if it reaches or exceeds 10 instances from the same source IPs within a short time frame. Investigate any sudden spikes or repeated ICMP echo requests from the same IPs to detect potential ping flood attempts early.
