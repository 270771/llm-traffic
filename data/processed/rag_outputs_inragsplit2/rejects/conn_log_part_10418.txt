Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for a ping flood.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.149.244, 133.247.31.249, 133.247.5.209, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150), indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context requires assigning a likely heuristic and taxonomy: this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify affected destination IP owners (69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150) to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Monitor network traffic for escalation or changes in attack vectors.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offending IPs if mitigation at the firewall is insufficient.
