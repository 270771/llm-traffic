Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only two ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instances are present in the snippet (from IPs 117.157.9.2 and 203.78.177.156). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3 and others) are present, which do not correspond to ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) packets may indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
