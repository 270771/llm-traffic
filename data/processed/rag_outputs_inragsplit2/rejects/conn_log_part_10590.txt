Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly present is anomaly_782 related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as 'ptmp' with heuristic 10, which corresponds to a SYN attack (TCP SYN flood), not a ping flood.  

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 further, focusing on the source IP 89.3.89.164 and port 8080.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if the SYN attack is causing service degradation and apply SYN flood mitigation techniques if necessary (e.g., rate limiting, SYN cookies).
