Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present (timestamp 1641099640.065108).
- The other entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The single ICMP Echo Request does not constitute flooding or scanning.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs.
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity once anomaly data or heuristics become available.
- Correlate with other logs for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
