Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets could be related to traceroute or routing issues, which are not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are any other logs showing ICMP type 8 packets in higher volume.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to better classify future suspicious traffic.
