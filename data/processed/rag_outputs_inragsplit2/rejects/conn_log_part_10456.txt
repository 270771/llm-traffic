Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (44.61.16.153) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the echo request type required for ping flood detection.
- Although the count is just under 10, the rapid succession and multiple unique sources strongly indicate a coordinated flood attempt.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard ping flood heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from suspicious source IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 44.61.16.153.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the identified source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
