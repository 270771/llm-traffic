Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 133.247.49.34 and 104.31.202.2.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
