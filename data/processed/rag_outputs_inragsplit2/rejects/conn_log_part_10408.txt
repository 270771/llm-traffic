Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP timestamp request. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP echo requests or other suspicious patterns.
