Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The anomalies present relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other suspicious heavy hitter or multi-port anomalies), none of which correspond to ping flood behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic.
- Heuristic 999 indicates other or unknown suspicious activity, unrelated to ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 and IP 185.58.127.74 on port 1433.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- If ICMP traffic appears, verify the ICMP type and count to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
