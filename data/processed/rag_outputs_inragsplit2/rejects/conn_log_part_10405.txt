Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic, not ICMP or ping flood.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN floods, a different DoS vector than ping floods.  
- The anomaly taxonomy class 'ptmp' is associated with heuristic 10, indicating a SYN flood or similar TCP-based attack.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by analyzing the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Ensure ICMP traffic is logged and parsed correctly to enable detection of ping floods per heuristic 20.
