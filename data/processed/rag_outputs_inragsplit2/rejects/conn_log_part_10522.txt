Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 8 (Echo Request), but there are only 2 instances with type 8 (from IPs 151.21.218.20 and 121.246.13.30). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (11 and 128) are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The traffic does not match the volume or pattern expected for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 151.21.218.20 and 121.246.13.30 for unusual ICMP activity if volume increases.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to improve detection accuracy.
