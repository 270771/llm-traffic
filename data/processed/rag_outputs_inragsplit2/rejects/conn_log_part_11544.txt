Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 130.197.60.23 to 173.97.102.144, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the threshold of 10 or more ICMP Echo Requests is met.  
- Investigate if the source IP 130.197.60.23 or destination IP 173.97.102.144 have any prior suspicious activity in other logs.
