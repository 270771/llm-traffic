Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.
- The only anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further for SYN flood or TCP-based DoS attacks given heuristic 10 is triggered.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Verify if ICMP logging is enabled and properly captured in Zeek to ensure visibility into ICMP-based attacks.
