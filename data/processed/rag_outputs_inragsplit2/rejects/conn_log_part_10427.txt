Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP: 54.178.233.150; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.178.233.150.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
4. Monitor network traffic for collateral impact and ensure critical services on 54.178.233.150 remain operational.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source if possible.
