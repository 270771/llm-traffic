Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The majority of ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, but there are only 9 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP 3.116.11.97, which is below the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found).
- Other ICMP types (0, 3, 11, 128, 129) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency.
- Investigate the destination IP 3.116.11.97 for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
