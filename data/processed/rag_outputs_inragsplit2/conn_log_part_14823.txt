Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.37.79.118 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to the same target indicate a ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.75.229, 133.247.81.6, 133.247.215.168, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.37.79.118 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 34.37.79.118 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
