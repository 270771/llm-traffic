Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values present in the log are mostly 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 8 (Echo Request). However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack. The other ICMP types are not type 8, so they do not contribute to a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override the count requirement.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages suggests normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs. If the count exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the source IPs 54.221.141.21 and 157.17.58.249 for any unusual activity in other logs.
