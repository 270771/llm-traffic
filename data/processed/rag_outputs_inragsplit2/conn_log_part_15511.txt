Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.

The heuristics and taxonomy context indicate:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).  
- Heuristic 999 is a custom heavy hitter classification.  
- No evidence of ICMP-based anomalies or ping flood heuristics (20) is found.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further, as multiple TCP connections show SYN flags with failures (S0 state), indicating possible SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to catch ping floods early.
