Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `133.247.49.34` to `104.25.153.201` with a count of 0 packets, indicating no actual echo requests sent.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant for ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate if the destination IPs are responding unusually or if other protocols show suspicious activity.
