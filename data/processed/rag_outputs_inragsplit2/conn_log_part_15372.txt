Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to ping floods.
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood activity.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging and anomaly detection.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to identify possible flooding.
