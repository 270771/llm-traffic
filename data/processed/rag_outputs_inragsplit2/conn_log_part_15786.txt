Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log entries is mostly 8 for some entries, which corresponds to echo request (ping). However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 from the same source IP (52.236.221.123) to different destination IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomalies or heuristic matches (such as heuristic 20) are present in the anomaly CSV to override the instance count requirement.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8 or are isolated single events, not indicative of flooding.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 52.236.221.123 for unusual ICMP activity if the count rises.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for potential emerging threats.
