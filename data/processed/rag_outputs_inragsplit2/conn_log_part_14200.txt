Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or the logs.  
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080 from IP 89.3.89.164, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly_782 further by monitoring traffic from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Confirm that ICMP traffic is being logged properly to ensure visibility into ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 suggests partial or incomplete connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
