Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the criteria for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 traffic could be related to normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 traffic spikes abnormally, which could indicate network misconfigurations or other issues.
