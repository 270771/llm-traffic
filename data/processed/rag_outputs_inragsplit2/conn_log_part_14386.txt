Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is present in the snippet (from 133.247.49.34 to 104.8.85.197).  
- The other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or scanning by themselves.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP type 3 or 11 messages in large volumes, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to improve detection accuracy.
