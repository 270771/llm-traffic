Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 128, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP activity such as Echo Reply (type 0), Time Exceeded (type 11), and Echo Request for IPv6 (type 128), none indicating flooding.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for unusual ICMP traffic volume or other anomaly indicators is recommended as a best practice.
