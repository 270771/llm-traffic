Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (code 3) traffic, not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could represent an ICMP destination unreachable message (type 3, code 3). Without further data or heuristics, no attack is detected.

No further immediate action is required, but monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests (type 8) or multiple repeated ICMP messages from the same source IP could be useful for early detection of future ping floods.
