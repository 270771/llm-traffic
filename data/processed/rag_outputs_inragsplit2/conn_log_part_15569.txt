Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the conn.log snippet shows two entries with ICMP protocol, but the ICMP type is not explicitly provided. However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the counts of packets are very low (1 and 58 packets respectively).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) visible, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious IPs or known ping flood heuristics.  
- Without evidence of ICMP type 8 or a high volume of echo requests, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields explicitly in the full logs to confirm the absence of type 8 packets.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests or anomalies related to these IPs.  
- Collect and correlate additional network data to detect other potential attack vectors.
