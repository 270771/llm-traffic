Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one from 133.247.166.216, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.237.221.62.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.
