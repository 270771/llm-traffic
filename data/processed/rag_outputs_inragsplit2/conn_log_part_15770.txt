Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs targeting one destination.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.157.249, 133.247.157.11, 133.247.171.162, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so port 0 is standard here).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
  5. Conduct a deeper investigation to identify if this is part of a larger distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaign and coordinate with upstream providers if necessary.
