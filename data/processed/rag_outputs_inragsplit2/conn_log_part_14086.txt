Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here. The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.157.211, 133.247.157.234, 133.247.79.32, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host 54.193.126.151 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from suspicious or unexpected regions.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or spoofed addresses.
