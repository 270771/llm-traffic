Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 ICMP connections from source IP 15.130.145.131 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to diverse targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 15.130.145.131; Destination IPs include 202.194.55.215, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.55.136, 202.194.17.37, 202.194.55.37, 202.194.17.38, 202.194.17.63, 202.194.15.184, 202.194.15.188, 202.194.58.110, 202.194.63.1. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 15.130.145.131 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
