Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a few source IPs (notably 34.25.134.27 and 35.183.65.24) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time window (~0.01 seconds).
- This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) by implication, as the volume and rapidity of ICMP type 8 packets strongly indicate malicious activity.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: 34.25.134.27, 35.183.65.24 (primary attackers)
- Destination IPs: Multiple 163.252.x.x addresses and others (targets)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (34.25.134.27 and 35.183.65.24).
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious IPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the attack at a higher network level.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature specifically tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a post-incident review to assess impact and improve detection heuristics for future attacks.
