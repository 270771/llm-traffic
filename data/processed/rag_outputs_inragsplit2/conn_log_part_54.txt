Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious with heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with abnormal ICMP traffic patterns typical of ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 (primary attacker), destination IPs include 23.222.79.252, 165.1.152.130, 2.213.218.3, 104.66.131.251, 165.1.129.60, 23.189.53.250, 104.119.65.248, 23.230.241.255, 23.178.128.251, 104.119.193.250, 65.119.142.122, among others. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- The traffic pattern matches a distributed ICMP Echo Request flood targeting multiple hosts, consistent with heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error."

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network devices for increased ICMP traffic and potential collateral impact on network performance.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to identify compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
5. Notify affected destination IP owners if internal to the organization or coordinate with upstream providers if external.

This targeted response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood and prevent further network degradation.
