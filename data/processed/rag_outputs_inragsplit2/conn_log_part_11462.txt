Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- The absence of anomaly records or heuristic context means we assign heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection based on ICMP type and frequency) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 52.181.17.215 with ICMP Echo Requests on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so port 0 is standard here).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 52.181.17.215 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
