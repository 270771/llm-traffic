Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 68.104.133.69 to 202.194.37.129, and there is only 1 occurrence, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 202.194.17.63 to 120.164.200.49) does not specify ICMP type 8, so it is not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional heuristic or anomaly information, no further specific investigation is warranted based on this snippet alone. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies is recommended.
