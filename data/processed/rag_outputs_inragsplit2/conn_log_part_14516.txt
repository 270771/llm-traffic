Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows no ICMP type 8 (echo request) specified, and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is evident from the given data. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or related anomalies, this traffic does not match typical denial-of-service or reconnaissance patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 202.124.53.30 to destination 162.65.197.200. Collect more detailed ICMP type information and check for any emerging anomalies or heuristic matches to confirm or rule out future ping flood attempts.
