Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal control messages rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.194.17.63 and 203.78.181.110) for any unusual activity or other anomaly indicators.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
