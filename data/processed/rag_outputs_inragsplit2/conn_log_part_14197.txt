Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.173.100.241 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241 is the attacker; destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPâ€™s network segment to identify if this is a compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if the attack persists to assist in filtering traffic upstream.
