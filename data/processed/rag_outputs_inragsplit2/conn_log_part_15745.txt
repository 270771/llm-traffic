Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 13 or 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) are normal control messages and do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.
