Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but fewer than 10 instances are observed in the snippet.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs are indicated, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The traffic does not show the volume or repetition pattern typical of a ping flood attack.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this snippet.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if a pattern emerges matching heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated requests from single IPs.
