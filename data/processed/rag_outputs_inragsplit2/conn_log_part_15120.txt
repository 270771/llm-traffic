Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 (timestamp request) and 10 (timestamp reply), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The observed ICMP types relate to timestamp messages, which are generally benign or diagnostic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if timestamp requests/replies are unusually frequent or correlated with other suspicious activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
