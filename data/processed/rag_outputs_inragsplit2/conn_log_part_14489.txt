Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic states at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 must be present unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved; neither condition is met here.  
- The anomaly CSV record references a suspicious connection with heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp', unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  

No other attack type clearly matches the given data. The anomaly with heuristic 999 likely relates to multi-port or multi-target scanning but is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly_1442 further by correlating with additional logs to understand the nature of the suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42:46280.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or repeated Echo Requests in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
