Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here due to the volume and type of ICMP traffic.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are similarly targeted.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if the attack volume is large and persistent to coordinate traffic filtering.
