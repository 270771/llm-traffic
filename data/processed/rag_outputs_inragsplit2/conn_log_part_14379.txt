Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.150.129 to destination 35.127.34.186, but there is only 1 instance of this type, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets are part of a different network issue or reconnaissance activity.
