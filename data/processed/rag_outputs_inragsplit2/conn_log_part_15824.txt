Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all entries, satisfying the condition for ping flood detection.
- No anomalies from the anomaly CSV directly reference these IPs or ports, and no heuristic 20 is explicitly listed there, but the traffic pattern strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (Ping flood) from the heuristic context.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Destination: 52.236.221.123 (target of the flood)
  - Sources: Multiple IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 133.247.49.34
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs (157.17.151.25, 157.17.64.212, 157.17.8.40, etc.) at upstream routers or via ISP coordination.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) under the taxonomy class of ICMP-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
