Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 3, 8, and 8, but only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) are observed, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  
- The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and only a few ICMP type 8 packets suggests normal or isolated ICMP traffic rather than a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they appear repeatedly or in other suspicious contexts.
