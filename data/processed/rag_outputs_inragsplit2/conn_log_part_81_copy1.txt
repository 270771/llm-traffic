Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances (24 entries) of ICMP type 8 from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) targeting multiple destination IPs in a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.76.120.97; multiple destination IPs including 163.21.213.11, 203.65.127.222, 133.250.64.25, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts and network devices to mitigate impact.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
