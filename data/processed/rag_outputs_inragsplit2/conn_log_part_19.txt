Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 16 ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.79.249 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attackâ€”high volume of ICMP Echo Requests targeting many hosts in a short time.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack, and the taxonomy class "icmp_error" aligns with ICMP-based anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.79.249 is flooding multiple destination IPs in the 133.141.197.x subnet with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.79.249 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious IPs.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
