Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one host) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.30.122, 133.247.24.1, 133.247.50.170, etc.) flooding destination IP 157.187.159.183. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers to mitigate the attack at the source if possible.
