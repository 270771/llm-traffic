Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources exhibiting similar ICMP flooding behavior.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external to coordinate mitigation.
