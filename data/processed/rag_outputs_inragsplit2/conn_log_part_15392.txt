Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 45.35.56.57, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 and 10, which do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic for ping flood requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other protocol anomalies if they arise.
