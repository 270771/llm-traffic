Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.228.4.24) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is triggered by at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.23.52, 157.17.230.129, 157.17.158.51, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.228.4.24. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation plans such as blackholing or sinkholing if needed.
