Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly record references a suspicious source IP (107.81.9.228) targeting port 23 (Telnet), categorized under heuristic 999 and taxonomy class 'mptmp', which likely indicates a multi-packet or multi-target scanning or exploitation attempt, not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP traffic or at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

Next steps:
- Investigate the suspicious activity from 107.81.9.228 on port 23 further, as it may indicate scanning or brute force attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping flood attacks.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies or rate-based alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to multi-packet/multi-target anomalies ('mptmp'), unrelated to ICMP flooding.
- No heuristic 20 or ICMP-related heuristics are triggered here.
