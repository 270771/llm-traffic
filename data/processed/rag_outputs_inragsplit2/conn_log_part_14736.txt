Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 1 and 8, but only two instances of ICMP type 8 are logged, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the instance count requirement.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over a longer period or checking other logs for related anomalies.
