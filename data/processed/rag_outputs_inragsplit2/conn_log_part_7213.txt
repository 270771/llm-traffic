Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (50.239.214.145) within a very short time window, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 217.169.200.180) targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 50.239.214.145.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from identified malicious source IPs.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to volumetric DoS mitigation services if traffic volume increases.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any source IPs are spoofed and update firewall rules accordingly.
