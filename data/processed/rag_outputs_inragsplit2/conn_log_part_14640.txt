Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times (from src IPs 157.17.55.112, 157.17.106.198, and 157.17.114.57 to dst IP 161.67.57.135).  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 0 or 11, which do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomalies or heuristics are found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type. The traffic pattern does not match known ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 161.67.57.135 is experiencing any service degradation or unusual traffic patterns.  
- Collect more data or logs to identify if any other attack vectors are present.
