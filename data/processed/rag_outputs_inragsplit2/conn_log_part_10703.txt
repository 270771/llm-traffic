Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance present is a single packet from 185.112.210.201 to 203.78.187.167.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 129, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 185.112.210.201 has any prior history of suspicious activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
