Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.221.141.21 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement or review existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
