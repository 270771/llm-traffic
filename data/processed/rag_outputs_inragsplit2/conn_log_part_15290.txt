Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are fewer than 10 instances of type 8, the traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation should focus on:  
- Collecting more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs to verify if any type 8 packets appear in volume.  
- Checking for other ICMP-based anomalies such as unreachable messages (type 3) or time exceeded (type 11) that might indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Obtaining heuristic and taxonomy definitions to better classify future anomalies.
