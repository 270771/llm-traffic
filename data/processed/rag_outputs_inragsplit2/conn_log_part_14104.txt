Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.166.249.180) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (133.247.7.218, 133.247.137.176, 133.247.55.222, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.166.249.180 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (54.166.249.180) for performance degradation and consider isolating it if service impact is detected.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of similar ICMP flood traffic.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering.
