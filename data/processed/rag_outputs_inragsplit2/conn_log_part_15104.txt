Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination) typically associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.0.186, 133.247.35.4, 133.247.20.223, etc.) targeting destination IP 13.86.47.233. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (13.86.47.233) for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts in a botnet.
