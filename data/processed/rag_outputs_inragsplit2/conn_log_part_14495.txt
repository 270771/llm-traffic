Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the provided conn.log snippet. The entries show ICMP traffic but do not confirm type 8.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Collect more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs, including explicit ICMP type codes, to verify if multiple Echo Requests (type 8) are occurring.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged by heuristics once available.
