Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of either 3 or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages rather than flooding attacks.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP error message patterns or misconfigurations.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
