Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8 and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns based on the limited data.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and insufficient evidence of attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Correlate with other network indicators to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.
