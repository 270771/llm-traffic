Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.130.188.37 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" based on standard ICMP flood attack classifications.
- Involved IP: Attacker/source IP is 35.130.188.37; destination IPs include 203.78.189.133, 203.78.180.51, 203.78.180.145, 203.78.189.138, 203.78.190.207, 203.78.151.198, 203.78.190.198, 203.78.170.126, 203.78.191.199, 203.78.151.197, 203.78.191.240, 203.78.171.209, 203.78.171.216, 203.78.170.65, 203.78.182.19, 203.78.181.10, 203.78.179.68, 203.78.179.88.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.130.188.37 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on affected destination IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify affected parties of potential DoS impact and prepare for possible escalation.
- Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood scenarios.
