Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connection attempts; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related anomalies; they show SYN flood (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter anomalies unrelated to ICMP.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the provided data.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the logs or anomalies. The heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter) are present but relate to TCP traffic, not ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging and anomaly detection to capture potential ping floods.
- Monitor source IPs flagged in anomalies for other attack vectors, such as SYN floods, given heuristic 10 is present.
