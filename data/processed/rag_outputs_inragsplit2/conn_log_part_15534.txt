Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP connections on port 8080, but no heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies are present.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets, not ICMP.
- Therefore, the traffic matches a SYN flood pattern rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 for SYN attack activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if the SYN anomalies cause service degradation or denial of service.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by many SYN packets causing resource exhaustion.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial TCP message patterns typical in SYN floods.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on mitigating the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10.
