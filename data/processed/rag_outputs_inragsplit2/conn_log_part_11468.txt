Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet are involved, indicating a distributed source pattern typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in 133.228.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP: 52.181.17.215; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network performance and logs for signs of service degradation or collateral impact.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or mitigate attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
