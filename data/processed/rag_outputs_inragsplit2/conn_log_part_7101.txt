Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests flooding the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 52.230.228.52; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is a layer 3 protocol.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host (52.230.228.52) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., traffic scrubbing, blackholing).
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
