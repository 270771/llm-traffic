Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; Destination IPs include 163.252.13.105, 163.252.184.26, 163.252.75.57, and many others.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected parties (owners of destination IPs) to prepare for potential service degradation.
