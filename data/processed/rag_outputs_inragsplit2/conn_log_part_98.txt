Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet present is from 54.205.67.225 to 203.65.103.15, and there is only 1 instance of this type.
- The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 1, which are not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this threshold.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 54.205.67.225 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ICMP-based attacks.
