Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.37.79.118, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x and one 139.179.133.57 range, all targeting destination IP 34.37.79.118 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 34.37.79.118 for service degradation and consider temporarily isolating it from the network if the attack persists.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources and coordinate with upstream providers for traffic filtering or blackholing if necessary.
