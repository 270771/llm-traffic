Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times from the same source IP (54.253.199.134) to different destination IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the given data. The presence of a few ICMP echo requests is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 54.253.199.134 if it continues to send multiple ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
