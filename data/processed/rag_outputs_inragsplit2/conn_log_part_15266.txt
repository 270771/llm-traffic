Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (159.109.173.90) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic, which typically corresponds to heuristic number 20 in common taxonomies (ICMP flood attack).
- Involved IP: Source IP 159.109.173.90; Destination IPs include 203.78.182.77, 203.78.180.20, 203.78.180.15, 202.194.63.1, 202.194.58.66, 163.252.194.208, 163.252.158.33, 163.252.159.130, 133.251.113.64, 133.251.114.228, 133.251.115.0, 202.194.63.8, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.58.98, 163.252.159.92, 133.251.115.250, 133.251.115.217, 203.78.180.187.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 159.109.173.90 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network devices and servers for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance caused by the flood.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the network monitoring system for early detection of similar attacks.
5. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service impact and coordinate mitigation if necessary.
