Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services hosted on 52.236.221.123.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic if attack volume is large.
