Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178). This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from many source IPs to a single or few destination IPs.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IPs 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting the affected destination IPs.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
  5. Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
