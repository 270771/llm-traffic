Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. There are no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 to override this count.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or high-volume ICMP traffic is evident.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests from 133.247.1.125 to 69.47.69.34 is recommended to detect any escalation.
