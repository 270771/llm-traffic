Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is required for ping flood detection, but only one instance is present. The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs. If multiple such packets appear rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
