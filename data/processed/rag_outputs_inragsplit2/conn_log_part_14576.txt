Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only two ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entry is type 11, which is not relevant for ping floods. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for a potential ping flood. Additionally, investigate the source IPs 192.178.71.64 and 157.17.48.98 for any suspicious behavior in other logs.
