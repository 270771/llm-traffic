Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two instances from IPs 183.249.233.225 and 163.171.168.73. This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood.  
- The third ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 conditions, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or correlating with other logs to detect slow or distributed ICMP-based reconnaissance.
