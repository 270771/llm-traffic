Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 50.239.214.145 from multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources targeting a single destination, overwhelming it.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.221.176, 133.228.124.86, 133.228.232.6, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 50.239.214.145. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 50.239.214.145 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
