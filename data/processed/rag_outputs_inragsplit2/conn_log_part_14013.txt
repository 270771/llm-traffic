Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the IP 34.25.86.31 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range, as well as multiple ICMP type 8 packets from 68.104.133.69 to various 133.251.x.x IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP echo requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) not being present, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets applies and is met.
- The most likely heuristic number is 10 (ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources: 68.104.133.69 and various 157.17.x.x IPs, targeting destination IP 34.25.86.31 and several 133.251.x.x IPs. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges (68.104.133.69 and 157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the targeted IPs (especially 34.25.86.31) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage with upstream providers or ISPs to trace and mitigate the attack traffic.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Consider temporary blocking or blackholing of the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
