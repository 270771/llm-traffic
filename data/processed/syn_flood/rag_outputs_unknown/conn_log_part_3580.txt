- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with 160 SYN packets over 3.8 seconds, no anomalies recorded.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic context available to confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the high volume of SYN packets in a short time frame targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block or rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial of service. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
