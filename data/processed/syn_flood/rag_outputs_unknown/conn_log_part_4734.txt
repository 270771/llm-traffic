- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.29 on port 8139, showing 39 SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, high packet rate (45.56 packets/sec), and TCP flags consistent with SYN flood (SYN set, no ACK).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—high SYN packet count without ACK responses and rapid packet rate—are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
