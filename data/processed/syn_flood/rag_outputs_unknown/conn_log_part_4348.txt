- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:57199 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and RSTR flags observed.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without successful handshakes and presence of RSTR (Reset) flags strongly aligns with typical SYN flood attack behavior as per standard network security knowledge.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target on port 23 (Telnet).
