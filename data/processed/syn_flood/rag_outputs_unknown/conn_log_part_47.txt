  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source IP for potential blocking if attack persists.
