- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:7349 to 163.21.20.102:636 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
