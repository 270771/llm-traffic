  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to classic SYN flood signature (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
