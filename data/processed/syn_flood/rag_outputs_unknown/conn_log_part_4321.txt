- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41073 to 203.65.12.152:12139 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 state with SYN flags and zero established connections) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
