- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.67.240 on port 21002 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or established connections, indicated by S0 flag and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, consistent with known TCP connection exhaustion patterns.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
