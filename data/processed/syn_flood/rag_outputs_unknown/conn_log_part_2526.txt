- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60794 to 133.118.194.129:21290 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the SYN flood alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN sent and no response), which is a known indicator of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
