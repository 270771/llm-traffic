- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination 202.152.168.238 on port 8291, characterized by multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the destination server.
