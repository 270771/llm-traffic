- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.169.175:2082 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
