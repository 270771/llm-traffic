- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:17313 to 133.118.9.57:465 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (SYN sent, no ACK received).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
