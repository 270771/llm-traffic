- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64149 to 133.250.101.164:12382 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this alert.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
