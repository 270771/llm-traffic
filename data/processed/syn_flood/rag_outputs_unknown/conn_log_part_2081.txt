- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.198.15 on port 11112 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
