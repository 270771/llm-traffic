- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.203.201:8000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
