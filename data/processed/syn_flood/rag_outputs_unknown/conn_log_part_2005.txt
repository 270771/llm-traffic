- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.145.180 on port 12173 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the connection state (S0) and packet pattern alone are definitive indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
