- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.190.148:8140 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (SYN sent, no ACK) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
