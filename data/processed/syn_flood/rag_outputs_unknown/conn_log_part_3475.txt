- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40089 to 163.21.246.35:21500 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet sent and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood symptom—SYN packets sent without completing the handshake (S0 state). Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to confirm, this behavior is consistent with SYN flood patterns where attackers send SYNs without completing connections to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
