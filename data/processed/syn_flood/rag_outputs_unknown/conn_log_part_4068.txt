- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.184.183 on port 9307 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, multiple SYNs without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
