- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.60.245 on port 5901 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
