- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:28079 to 133.250.187.226:548 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
