- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.80.47 on port 3790 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no established connections) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
