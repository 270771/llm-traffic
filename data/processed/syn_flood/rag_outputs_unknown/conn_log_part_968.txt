- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.80.14 on port 548 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
