- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.199.231 on port 5577 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are canonical indicators of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source for potential malicious activity.
