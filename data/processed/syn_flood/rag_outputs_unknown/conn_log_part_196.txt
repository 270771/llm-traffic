- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:49389 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and no established connection, high connection rate (0.657768), and multiple retries (2).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection patterns to port 23 (Telnet), as repeated RSTR responses and high connection attempts indicate potential SYN flood or scanning behavior targeting a vulnerable service. Implement rate-limiting on incoming connections to port 23 to mitigate potential attack impact.
