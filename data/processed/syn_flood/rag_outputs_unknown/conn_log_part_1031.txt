- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40044 to 133.250.144.20:9734 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—SYN packets sent without completing TCP handshake (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Without anomaly confirmation, a cautious investigation and proactive rate-limiting is warranted.
