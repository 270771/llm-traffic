- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.250.12 on port 12590 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, SYN packets without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by resource exhaustion through half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block if the flood persists to protect server resources and maintain service availability. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
