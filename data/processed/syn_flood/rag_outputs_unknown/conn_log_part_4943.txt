- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.30.89:7547 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and the pattern of SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
