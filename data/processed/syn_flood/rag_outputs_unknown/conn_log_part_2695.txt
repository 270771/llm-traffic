- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22982 to 133.118.119.135:62443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with known SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
