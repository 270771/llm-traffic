- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7289 to 203.65.33.188:12366 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state), a classic sign of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the connection pattern itself is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent resource exhaustion.
