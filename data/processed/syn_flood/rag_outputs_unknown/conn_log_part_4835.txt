- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.246.38 on port 21264 show a pattern of SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
