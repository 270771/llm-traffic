- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63718 to 133.250.99.113:12314 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows a classic SYN flood symptom (S0 state with SYN sent and no ACK), which is a known indicator of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
