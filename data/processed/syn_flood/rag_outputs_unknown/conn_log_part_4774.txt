- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate for further malicious activity.
