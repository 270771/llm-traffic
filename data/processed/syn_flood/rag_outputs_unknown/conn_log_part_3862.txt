- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26492 to 133.118.235.203:5025 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; no heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is confirmed.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
