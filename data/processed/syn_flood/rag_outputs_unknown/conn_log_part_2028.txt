- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets with suspicious flags to port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate further.
