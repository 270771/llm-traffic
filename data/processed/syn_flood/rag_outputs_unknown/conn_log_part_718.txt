- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.164.9 on port 12561 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (S0 state with 44 SYN packets and zero completions).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server.
