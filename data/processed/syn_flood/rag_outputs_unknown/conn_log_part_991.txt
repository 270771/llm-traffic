- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64830 to 133.118.198.243:18044 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and 44 SYN packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
