- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.100.248 on port 8140 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8140 and initiate source investigation to prevent service disruption.
