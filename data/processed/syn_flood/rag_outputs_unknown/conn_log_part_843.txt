- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:11747 to 203.65.48.205:179 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with multiple attempts (44 packets) strongly aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
