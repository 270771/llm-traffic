- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 203.65.9.171:43111 targeting 192.103.164.17:636 with OTH flag and minimal response, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection. However, the observed pattern—numerous SYN attempts without completing handshakes—is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 203.65.9.171 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
