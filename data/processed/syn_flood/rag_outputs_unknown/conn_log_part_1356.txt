- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 33137 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP SYN flags and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the Telnet service.
