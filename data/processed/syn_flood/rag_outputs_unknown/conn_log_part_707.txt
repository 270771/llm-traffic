- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.105.8 on port 12442 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
