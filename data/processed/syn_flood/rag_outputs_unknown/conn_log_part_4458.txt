- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating half-open connections (SYN set, no ACK).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service.
