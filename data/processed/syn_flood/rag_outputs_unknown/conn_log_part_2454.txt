- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:58025 to 133.250.64.2:16084 showing zero successful handshakes and multiple resets (RSTO), indicating incomplete TCP sessions consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of repeated connection attempts without completion and RST flags aligns with typical SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
