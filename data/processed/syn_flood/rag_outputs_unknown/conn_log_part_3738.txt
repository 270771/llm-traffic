- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32659 to 203.65.100.129:12341 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it exhausts server resources by leaving connections half-open.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
