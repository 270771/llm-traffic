- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:26033 to 163.21.150.229:9908 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN attempts without connection completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server.
