- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:11284 to 163.21.96.27:135 with SYN packets but no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) to port 135—a common target for exploitation—is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
