- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.114.235 on ports 13841 → 14407 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
