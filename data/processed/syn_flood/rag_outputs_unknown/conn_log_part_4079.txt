- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.106.97 on port 16048 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
