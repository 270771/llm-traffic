- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:21077 to 163.21.178.144:44400 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior aimed at exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Initiate further monitoring for related suspicious activity.
