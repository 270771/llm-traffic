- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.73.90 on port 2376 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are consistent with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target host. Initiate further investigation to confirm attack scope and source intent.
