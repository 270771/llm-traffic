- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate network logs for additional suspicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are definitive indicators of a SYN flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
