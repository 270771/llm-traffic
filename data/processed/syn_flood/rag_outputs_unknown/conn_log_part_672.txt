- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:51351 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing OTH flag with zero payload and rapid timing.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, given the suspicious connection to port 23 (Telnet), a common target for exploitation.
