- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.46.196 on port 50070 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag and high SYN count without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
