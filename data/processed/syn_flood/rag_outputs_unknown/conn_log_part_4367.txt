- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.96.10 on port 1911 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
