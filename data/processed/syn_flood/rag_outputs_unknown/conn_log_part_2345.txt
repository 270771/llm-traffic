- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.121.15:2375 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target.
