- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:55460 to 202.152.173.202:23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) responses within 0.5 seconds.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the pattern of rapid SYN attempts with no successful connections and immediate resets is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet). Immediate blocking is premature without corroborating data, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to mitigate potential impact.
