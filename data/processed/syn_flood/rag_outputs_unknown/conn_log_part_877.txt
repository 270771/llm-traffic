- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 157.161.40.85 to 159.1.193.245 on port 8165 shows OTH flag with 40 SYN packets and zero completions, indicating incomplete handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections is a classic SYN flood signature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 157.161.40.85 and block if the behavior persists to mitigate denial-of-service impact. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
