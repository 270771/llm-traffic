- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19721 to 133.118.114.35:20256 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no ACK or completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect server availability.
