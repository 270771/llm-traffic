- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9470 to 133.118.116.218:10081 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections and multiple SYN attempts) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
