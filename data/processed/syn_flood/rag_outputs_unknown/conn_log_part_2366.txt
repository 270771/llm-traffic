- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.59.239 on port 6379 show SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood pattern (S0 flag with no ACK response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
