- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.209.71 on port 9944 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
