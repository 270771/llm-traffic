- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10474 to 163.21.103.196:10180 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns from other sources.
