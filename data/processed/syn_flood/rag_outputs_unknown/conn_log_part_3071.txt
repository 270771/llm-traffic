- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58479 to 203.65.6.73:16061 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.6.73. Initiate further monitoring to confirm attack persistence.
