- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.203.73:55442 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
