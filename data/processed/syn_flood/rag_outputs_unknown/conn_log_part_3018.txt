- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.118.197.227:4063 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood characteristics, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
