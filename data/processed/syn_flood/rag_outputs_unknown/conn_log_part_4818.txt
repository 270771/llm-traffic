- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.88.158 on port 8112 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
