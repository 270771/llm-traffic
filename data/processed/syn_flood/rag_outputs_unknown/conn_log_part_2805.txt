- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.37.82 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
