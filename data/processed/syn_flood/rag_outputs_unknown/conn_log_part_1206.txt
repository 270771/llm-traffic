- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31586 to 163.21.130.123:9530 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (44 SYNs with zero completions) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server 163.21.130.123 from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
