- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge, as the alert alone lacks corroborating anomaly evidence.
