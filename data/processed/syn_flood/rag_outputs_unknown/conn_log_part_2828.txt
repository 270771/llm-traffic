- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.76.34 on port 32400 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
