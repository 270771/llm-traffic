- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:9395 to 163.21.90.168:62016 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect target host 163.21.90.168.
