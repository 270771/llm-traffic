  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple SYN attempts (S0 state) without any successful connection establishment is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
