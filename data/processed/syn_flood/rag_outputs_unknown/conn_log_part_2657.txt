- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:11187 to 163.21.42.225:8200 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
