- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31814 to 163.21.177.174:50106 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0 state, single SYN packet, no response) align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections intended to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for potential malicious intent.
