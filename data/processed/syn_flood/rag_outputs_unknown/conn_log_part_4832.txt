- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.183.218 on port 21294 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
