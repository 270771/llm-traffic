- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.23.62 on port 35251 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
