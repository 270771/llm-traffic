- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.156.100 on port 4040 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior due to clear SYN flood signature (many SYNs without handshake completion).
