- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination IP 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and initiate investigation on source behavior due to classic SYN flood characteristics (high SYN count, no ACK response), which typically indicate a denial-of-service attempt.
