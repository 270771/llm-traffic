- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43678 to 163.21.101.22:10324 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
