- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33428 to 133.250.76.69:12316 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt, where the attacker sends SYNs without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated attempts; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
