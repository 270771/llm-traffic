- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating half-open connections (SYN flag set, no ACK).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
