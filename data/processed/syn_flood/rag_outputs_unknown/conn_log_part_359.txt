- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40478 to 203.65.108.86:12559 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN attempts strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal SYN retransmissions; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
