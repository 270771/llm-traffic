- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 47.41.151.4 to 163.21.148.140 on port 23 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state), a classic SYN flood signature.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 47.41.151.4 to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
