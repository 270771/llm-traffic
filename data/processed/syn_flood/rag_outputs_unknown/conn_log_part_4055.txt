- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.69.191 on port 2762 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
