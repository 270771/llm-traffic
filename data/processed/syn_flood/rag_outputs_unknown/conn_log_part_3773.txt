- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.225.84 on port 8889 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8889 and initiate investigation on source IP due to classic SYN flood signature (numerous SYNs without handshake completion).
