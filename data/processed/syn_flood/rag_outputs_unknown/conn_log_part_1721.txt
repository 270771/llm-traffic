- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:50230 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with immediate resets on port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting a vulnerable service. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for escalation. If attack persists, block IP to protect Telnet service.
