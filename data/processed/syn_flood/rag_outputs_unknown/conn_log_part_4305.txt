- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.6.171 on ports 22831 → 23128 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual SYN packet volume and consider rate-limiting connections pending further data.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and no completion). Immediate investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
