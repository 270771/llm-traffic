- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30991 to 203.65.58.32:8554 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero completed connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server at 203.65.58.32. Implement rate-limiting on port 8554 to mitigate potential impact.
