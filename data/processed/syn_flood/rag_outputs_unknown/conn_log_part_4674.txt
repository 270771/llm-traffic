- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41663 to 163.21.202.237:10200 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
