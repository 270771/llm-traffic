- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate network logs for additional suspicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion of TCP handshakes on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack and warrants decisive blocking action.
