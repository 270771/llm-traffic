- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid connection attempts (2.56 seconds interval) and multiple flags indicating incomplete handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN flood behavior due to rapid SYN attempts and incomplete handshakes, which are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
