- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.210.47 on port 2067 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
