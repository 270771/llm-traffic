- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:36390 to 163.21.99.105:12338 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior align with standard SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood impact and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
