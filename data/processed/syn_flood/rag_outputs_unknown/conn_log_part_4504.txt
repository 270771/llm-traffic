- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9943 to 133.250.122.66:18556 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state flags (S0) and single SYN packet without response.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
