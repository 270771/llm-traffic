- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 163.21.184.124 to 192.103.164.17 on port 636 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior (high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 163.21.184.124 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
