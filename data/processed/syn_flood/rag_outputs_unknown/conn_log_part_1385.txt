- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including a high rate of SYN packets without successful handshakes, indicated by zero established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistence is observed, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
