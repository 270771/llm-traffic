- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:42023 to 163.21.25.111:12372 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
