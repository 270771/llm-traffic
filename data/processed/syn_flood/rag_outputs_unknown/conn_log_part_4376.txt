- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.182.244 on port 9761 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it consumes server resources by leaving connections half-open.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for repeated attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
