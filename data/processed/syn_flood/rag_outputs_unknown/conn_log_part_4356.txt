- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25059 to 133.250.181.186:31380 showing S0 flag with zero bytes transferred, indicating a SYN packet sent without completing handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with zero data and single SYN packet suggests incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior. Recommend rate-limiting connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for repeated attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.
