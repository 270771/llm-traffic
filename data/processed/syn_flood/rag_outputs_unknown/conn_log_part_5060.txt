- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.230.198:25105 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
