- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.253.197 on port 2086 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on target server.
