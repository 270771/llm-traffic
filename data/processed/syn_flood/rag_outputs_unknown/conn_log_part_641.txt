- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 (source port 44533) targeting destination IP 202.152.173.202 on port 23.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm or explain this detection.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 immediately and apply rate-limiting or block connections if SYN flood behavior persists, as SYN floods on port 23 (Telnet) indicate an attempt to overwhelm legacy service access.
