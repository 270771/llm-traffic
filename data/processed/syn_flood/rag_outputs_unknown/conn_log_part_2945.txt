- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:17422 to 203.65.54.138:444 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without ACKs are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
