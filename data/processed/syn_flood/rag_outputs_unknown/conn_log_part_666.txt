- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34237 to 133.118.34.219:35531 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN-only traffic consistent with SYN flood behavior, warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
