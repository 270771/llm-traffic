- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22907 to 133.250.132.219:16001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
