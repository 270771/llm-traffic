- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with 4.49 seconds duration and 160 SYN packets sent without completing connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and initiate investigation on source behavior due to high volume of incomplete TCP handshakes targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), which is a known vector for SYN flood attacks.
