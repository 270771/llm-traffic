- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 initiated numerous TCP SYN packets to destination 202.44.226.32 on port 5938, with connection state S0 indicating SYN sent but no response, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the connection pattern (many SYNs with no completion) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target.
