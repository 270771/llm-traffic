- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 23320 targeting 133.250.98.32 port 8139 exhibited TCP SYN flood behavior with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
