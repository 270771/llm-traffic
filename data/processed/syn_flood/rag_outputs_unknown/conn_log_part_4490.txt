- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:16655 to 133.118.203.193:3389 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) to a sensitive port (3389, RDP) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential denial-of-service on RDP service. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
