- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.117.83 on port 11688 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
