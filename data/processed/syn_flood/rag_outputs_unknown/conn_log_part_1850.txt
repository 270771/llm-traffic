- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.161.138 on port 17443 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the connection state (S0) and packet pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
