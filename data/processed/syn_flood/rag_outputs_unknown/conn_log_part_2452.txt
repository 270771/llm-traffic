- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.120.1 on port 18042 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the SYN flag without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly detection taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
