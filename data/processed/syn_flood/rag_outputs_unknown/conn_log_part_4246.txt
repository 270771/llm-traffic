- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.132.191 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to clear SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), which is a classic denial-of-service pattern disrupting target availability.
