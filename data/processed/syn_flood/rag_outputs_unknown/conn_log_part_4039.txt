- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.145.55 on port 12289 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
