- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and presence of RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of repeated SYNs without established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on port 23 (Telnet).
