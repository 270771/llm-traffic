- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22951 to 133.118.227.67:12311 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (many SYNs with no ACKs), which is a classic denial-of-service signature. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
