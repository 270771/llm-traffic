- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54159 to 202.44.230.3:16013 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
