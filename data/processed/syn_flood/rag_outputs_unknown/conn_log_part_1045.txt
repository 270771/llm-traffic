- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.71.105 on port 5007 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero completed connections strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern by definition.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
