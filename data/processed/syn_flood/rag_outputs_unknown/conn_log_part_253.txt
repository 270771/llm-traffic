- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.31.203 on port 9042 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
