- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39986 to 133.250.77.197:12186 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag indicates SYN packets sent without completing the TCP handshake, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
