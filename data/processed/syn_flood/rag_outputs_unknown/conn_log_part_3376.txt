- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.0.209 on ports 28491 → 10348 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood behavior (many SYNs without completing handshakes), which is a known threat pattern. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
