- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53804 to 133.250.110.236:9885 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
