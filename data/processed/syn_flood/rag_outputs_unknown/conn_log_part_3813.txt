- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:59343 to 163.21.20.173:16062 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
