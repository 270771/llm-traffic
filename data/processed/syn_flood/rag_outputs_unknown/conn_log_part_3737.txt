- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56041 to 203.65.5.58:12285 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior align with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
