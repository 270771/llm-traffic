- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.220.134 on port 9000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple connection attempts (44 attempts with 0 completions) align with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 9000 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server’s resources. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
