- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.236.81 on port 4500 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard network security understanding.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
