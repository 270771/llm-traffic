- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from source 107.81.9.228 (port 44475) to destination 202.152.173.202 (port 23) with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, multiple SYNs with no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
