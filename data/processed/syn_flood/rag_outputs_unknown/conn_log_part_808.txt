- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.252.70 on port 14147 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.252.70 and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
