- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 57494 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, multiple attempts in short interval).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern—multiple SYN packets targeting port 23 with suspicious TCP flags—is consistent with SYN flood attack behavior. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service on Telnet service and investigate source for further malicious activity.
