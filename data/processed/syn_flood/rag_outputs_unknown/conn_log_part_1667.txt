- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:57076 to 202.152.173.202:23 with rapid SYN packets and no established connections, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no handshake completion and RSTR responses on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect the Telnet service.
