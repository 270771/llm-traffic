- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.68.13 on port 2376 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
