- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packet rate (2.9 packets/sec), no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—high SYN rate without established connections—are consistent with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard network security understanding.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to protect the target on port 23 and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
