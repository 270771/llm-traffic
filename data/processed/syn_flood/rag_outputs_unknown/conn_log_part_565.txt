- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:44491 to 203.65.97.248:16100 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets sent (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.97.248. Initiate further investigation on source IP behavior.
