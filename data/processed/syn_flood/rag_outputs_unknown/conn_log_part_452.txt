- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:52444 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without successful handshakes and immediate resets is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target on port 23 (Telnet).
