- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64421 to 133.250.121.187:50004 showing SYN packets with no established connection (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN sent and no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
