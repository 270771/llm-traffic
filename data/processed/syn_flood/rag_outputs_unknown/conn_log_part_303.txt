- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.80.8 on port 10037 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no response, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
