- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:54533 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal behavior with zero successful handshakes and multiple reset responses (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators: multiple connection attempts with no successful handshake and reset responses, targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet, often targeted). Without anomaly data, confirmation is limited, but the behavior is consistent with SYN flood patterns. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
