- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.33.159 on port 55553 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly records or heuristics are available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
