- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 202.44.203.23:46717 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and no established connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 202.44.203.23 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of a single SYN packet with no follow-up connection (OTH flag) can indicate a SYN flood attempt. Without corroborating anomaly records, immediate blocking is premature, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
