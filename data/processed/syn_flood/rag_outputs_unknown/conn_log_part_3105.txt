- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake (indicated by RSTR flag and zero responses).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN flood behavior due to rapid SYN attempts without handshake completion, which is a classic SYN flood indicator.
