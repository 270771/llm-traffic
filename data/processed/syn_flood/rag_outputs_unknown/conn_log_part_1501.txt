- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24366 to 163.21.236.20:2404 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN flood pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received, connection not established). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating many half-open connections. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
