- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
