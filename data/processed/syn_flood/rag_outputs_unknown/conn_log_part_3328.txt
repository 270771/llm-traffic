- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22490 to 203.65.120.126:12280 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server 203.65.120.126. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
