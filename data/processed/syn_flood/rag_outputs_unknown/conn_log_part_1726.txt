- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21676 to 133.118.232.241:18023 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYNs and no established connections is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect network availability.
