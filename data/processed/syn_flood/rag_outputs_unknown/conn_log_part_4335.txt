- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic, as the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior (numerous SYN packets without handshake completion) targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), which is a high-risk service.
