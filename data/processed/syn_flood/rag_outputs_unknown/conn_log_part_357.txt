- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.97.126 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with many SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in standard network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target 133.250.97.126 from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
