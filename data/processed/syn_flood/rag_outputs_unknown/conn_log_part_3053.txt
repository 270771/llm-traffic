- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:35821 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and abnormal timing (0.661421s), indicating potential SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection patterns; consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious behavior consistent with SYN flood characteristics (high connection attempts, abnormal flags), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
