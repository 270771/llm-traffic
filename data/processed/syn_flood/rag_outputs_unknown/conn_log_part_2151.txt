- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.250.82 on port 22705 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
