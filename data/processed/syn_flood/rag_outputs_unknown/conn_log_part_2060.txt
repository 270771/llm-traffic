- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.182.154 on port 80 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the TCP handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
