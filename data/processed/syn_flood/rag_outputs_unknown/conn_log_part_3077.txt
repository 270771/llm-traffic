- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33283 to 203.65.86.180:12375 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN sent but no ACK received) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
