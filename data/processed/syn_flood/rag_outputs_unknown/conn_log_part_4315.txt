  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood patterns.
