- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60085 to 163.21.101.166:9273 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets (44) with no established connections (S0 state), indicating the target is not completing handshakes. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm, this behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
