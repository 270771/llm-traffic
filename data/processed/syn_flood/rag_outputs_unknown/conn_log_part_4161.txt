- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 45.121.111.255 to 203.65.103.15 on port 5060 show suspicious behavior with a high rate of connection attempts and zero successful completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no completions on a commonly targeted port (5060, often used for SIP) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 45.121.111.255 to 203.65.103.15 on port 5060 and initiate investigation of the source IP for potential blocking.
