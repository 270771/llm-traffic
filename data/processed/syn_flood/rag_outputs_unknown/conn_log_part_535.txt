- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2858 to 133.250.182.229:21254 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
