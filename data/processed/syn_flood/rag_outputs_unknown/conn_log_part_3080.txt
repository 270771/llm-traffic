- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:51018 to 202.152.173.202:23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting connections to port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
