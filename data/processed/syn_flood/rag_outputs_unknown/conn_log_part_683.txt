- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.172.165 on port 21272 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no ACK or completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
