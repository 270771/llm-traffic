- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show a high rate of SYN packets with no corresponding established connections, ending in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without connection establishment is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
