- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.112.117 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
