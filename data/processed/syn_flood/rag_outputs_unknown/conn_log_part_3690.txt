- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25144 to 202.44.254.218:10892 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets sent and 0 responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without responses (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
