- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49215 to 133.118.121.149:12141 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
