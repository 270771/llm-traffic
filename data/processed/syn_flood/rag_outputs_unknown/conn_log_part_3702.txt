- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:48268 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns are confirmed.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of repeated SYN attempts without successful connection establishment and RSTR responses on port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt targeting a vulnerable service. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
