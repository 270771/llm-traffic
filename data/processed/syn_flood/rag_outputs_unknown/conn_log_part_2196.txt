- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake (indicated by RSTR flag and zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without handshake completion on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
