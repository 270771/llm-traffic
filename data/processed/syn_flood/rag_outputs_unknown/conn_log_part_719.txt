- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.166.163 on port 12229 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (S0 state).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
