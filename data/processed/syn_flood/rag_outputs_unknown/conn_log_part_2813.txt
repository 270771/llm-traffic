- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.239.5 on port 64683 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic and well-documented indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect target resources.
