- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:41654 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and no established connection, indicating abnormal TCP behavior consistent with SYN flood characteristics.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of repeated TCP resets (RSTR) without successful handshakes on port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns aimed at exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
