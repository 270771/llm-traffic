- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with no successful handshake, indicated by RSTR (Reset) flags and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets and no established connections is consistent with SYN flood behavior.)
