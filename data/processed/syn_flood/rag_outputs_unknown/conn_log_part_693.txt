- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.254.182 on port 8139 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, consistent with known threat patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
