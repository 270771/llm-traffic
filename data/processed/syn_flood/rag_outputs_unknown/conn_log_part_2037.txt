- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.217.23:5560 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern directly align with classic SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without ACKs).
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
