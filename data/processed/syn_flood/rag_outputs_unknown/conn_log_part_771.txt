- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for potential malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), which is a frequent target for exploitation. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
