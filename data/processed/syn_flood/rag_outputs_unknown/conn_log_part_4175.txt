- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.248.132 on port 995 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) on a sensitive port (995 - typically POP3S) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
