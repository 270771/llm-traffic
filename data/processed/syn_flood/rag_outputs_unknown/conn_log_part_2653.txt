- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.25.204 on port 11065 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
