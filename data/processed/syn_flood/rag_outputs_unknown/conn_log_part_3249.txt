- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57211 to 133.118.51.91:44400 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 packets total, 0 responses).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and investigate source for potential blocking to mitigate denial-of-service risk.
