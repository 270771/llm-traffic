- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64238 to 133.118.148.194:40070 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
