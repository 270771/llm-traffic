- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.120.47 on port 16089 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on target. Initiate further investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
