- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31383 to 163.21.147.139:55000 with SYN packets resulting in no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no reply) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with known SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
