- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.120.78 on port 26 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
