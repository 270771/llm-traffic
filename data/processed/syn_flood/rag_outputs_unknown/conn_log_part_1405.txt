- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.224.159 on port 8200 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
