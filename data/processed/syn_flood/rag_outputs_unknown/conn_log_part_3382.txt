- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:31430 to 133.118.79.175:8099 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection attempt consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without handshake completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
