- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.241.195 on port 11211 with many incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN packets without completion to port 11211 (commonly associated with Memcached amplification attacks) confirms a SYN flood pattern. Block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further.
