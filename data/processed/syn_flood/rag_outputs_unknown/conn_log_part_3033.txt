- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.70.163 on port 1935 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood pattern.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed behavior (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
