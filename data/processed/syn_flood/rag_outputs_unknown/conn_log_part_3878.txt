- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN attempts with no completed connections and RSTR (reset) responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood behavior aimed at exhausting server resources. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
