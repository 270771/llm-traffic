- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63051 to 133.250.175.33:15555 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without completing handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
