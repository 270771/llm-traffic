  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates classic SYN flood characteristics: numerous connection attempts with no established sessions and reset flags, which disrupt normal TCP handshake completion. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
