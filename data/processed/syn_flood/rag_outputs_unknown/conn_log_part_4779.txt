- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.30.163 on port 84 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by multiple S0 flags (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
