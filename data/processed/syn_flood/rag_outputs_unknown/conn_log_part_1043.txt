- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.103.215 on port 12270 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero ACKs) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
