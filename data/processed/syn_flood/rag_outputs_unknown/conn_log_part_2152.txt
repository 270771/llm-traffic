- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7978 to 202.44.230.43:18102 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, which aims to exhaust server resources by initiating many half-open connections. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
