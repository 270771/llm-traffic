- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.158.89 on port 12141 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm targets by initiating many half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
