- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple connection resets (RSTR) and high connection attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with RST responses on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity.
