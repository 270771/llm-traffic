- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:31516 to 133.118.67.219:4500 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion).
