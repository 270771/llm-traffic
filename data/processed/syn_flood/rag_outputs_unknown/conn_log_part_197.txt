- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.201.112 on port 1433 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity, as repeated SYN packets without handshake completion strongly indicate a SYN flood attack targeting port 1433 (commonly MS SQL Server).
