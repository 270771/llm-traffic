- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed behavior—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion and RSTR responses—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet). Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
