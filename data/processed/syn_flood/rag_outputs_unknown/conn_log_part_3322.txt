- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high source port 63846 targeting destination 8.34.37.255 port 80 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, high packet count 490, low ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block traffic from source IP 157.161.40.85 to destination port 80 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
