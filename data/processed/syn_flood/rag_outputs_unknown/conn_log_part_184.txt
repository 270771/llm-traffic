- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.124.111 on port 12461 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as it shows incomplete TCP handshakes.
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
