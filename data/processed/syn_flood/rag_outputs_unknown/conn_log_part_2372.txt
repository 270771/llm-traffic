- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.169.178 on port 5984 show 70 SYN packets within 3.26 seconds, with zero successful connections and multiple RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the high volume of SYNs with no successful handshakes and reset responses strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern.
