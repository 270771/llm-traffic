- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection rates; consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN retries persist to prevent potential resource exhaustion.
