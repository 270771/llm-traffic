- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25740 to 163.21.141.130:12548 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the high number of SYN attempts without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
