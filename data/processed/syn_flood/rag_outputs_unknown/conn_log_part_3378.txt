- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.147.17 on ports 12547 → 11480 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect resources.
