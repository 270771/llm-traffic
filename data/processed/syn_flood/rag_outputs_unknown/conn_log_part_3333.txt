- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.191.215 on port 16401 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and high SYN count without completion is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly taxonomies.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
