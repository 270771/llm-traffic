- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26366 to 133.118.57.65:5009 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the high number of SYN attempts without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target 133.118.57.65.
