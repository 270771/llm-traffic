- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:50554 to 133.250.147.125:16099 shows S0 flag with 1 SYN packet sent, 0 ACKs received, and 44 bytes transferred, indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and lack of handshake completion are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
