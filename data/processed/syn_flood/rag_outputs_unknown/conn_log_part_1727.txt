- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58969 to 163.21.115.220:14401 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F) and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completion, overwhelming target resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target server.
