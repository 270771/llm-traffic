- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38772 to 163.21.12.35:11596 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior (S0 state with zero successful connections).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
