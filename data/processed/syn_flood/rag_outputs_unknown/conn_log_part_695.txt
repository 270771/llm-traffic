- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F) and a high count of SYN packets (40) without corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server on port 23.
