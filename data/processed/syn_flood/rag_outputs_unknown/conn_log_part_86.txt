- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 202.152.168.238 on port 8291, characterized by multiple SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
