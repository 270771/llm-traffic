- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58533 to 163.21.58.218:12104 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
