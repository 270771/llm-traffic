- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.250.101.183:21 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous half-open TCP connections (S0) to port 21 strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt targeting the FTP service. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the source IP to protect the service.
