- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.3.3 on port 21244 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target host 133.118.3.3 from resource exhaustion.
