- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54322 to 133.250.139.135:12481 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
