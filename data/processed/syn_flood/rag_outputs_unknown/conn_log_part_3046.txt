- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.106.52 on port 25 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) targeting port 25 (SMTP), which is a common vector for denial-of-service attacks.
