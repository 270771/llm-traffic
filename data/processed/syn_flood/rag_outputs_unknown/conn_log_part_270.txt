- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.41.243 on port 12484 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
