- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.64.113 on port 2222 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 2222 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
