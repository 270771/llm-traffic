- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.167.48 on port 53, showing a high number of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources by initiating but not completing TCP connections.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server’s availability.
