- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential malicious activity.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), which is a frequent target for denial-of-service attacks. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate potential service disruption.
