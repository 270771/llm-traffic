- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.101.2 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN with no response) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete handshakes, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
