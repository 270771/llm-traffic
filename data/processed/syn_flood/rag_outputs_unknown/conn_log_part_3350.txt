- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:65392 to 163.21.143.220:10052 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
