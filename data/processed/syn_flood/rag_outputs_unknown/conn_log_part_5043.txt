- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39373 to 133.118.220.238:12441 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections intended to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block if the behavior persists to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat intelligence.
