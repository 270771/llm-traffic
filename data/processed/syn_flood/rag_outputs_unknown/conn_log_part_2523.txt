- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event, and no heuristic context is available to further validate or explain the behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the alert indicates classic SYN flood characteristics (multiple SYNs without ACKs) targeting port 23 (Telnet), a commonly exploited service.
