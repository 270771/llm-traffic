- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34113 to 133.118.83.151:9527 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets sent without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
