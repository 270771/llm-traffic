- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.200.161 on port 21379 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and block the IP if the behavior persists to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on the source to confirm intent and prevent further disruption.
