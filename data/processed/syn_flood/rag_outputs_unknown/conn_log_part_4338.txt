- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with classic SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
