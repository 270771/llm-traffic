- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 33815 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets with suspicious flag combinations targeting port 23 (Telnet)—is consistent with typical SYN flood attack signatures documented in standard threat models.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
