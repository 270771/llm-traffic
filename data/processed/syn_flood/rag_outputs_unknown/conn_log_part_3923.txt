- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57128 to 203.65.6.108:12266 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block or throttle traffic if the pattern persists to mitigate the SYN flood impact. Investigate source IP for further malicious activity.
