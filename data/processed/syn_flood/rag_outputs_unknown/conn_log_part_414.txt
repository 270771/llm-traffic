- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.85.50 on port 6000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood characteristics as per common network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
