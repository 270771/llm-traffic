- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.98.164 on port 12470 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.98.164 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; consider blocking if attack persists.
