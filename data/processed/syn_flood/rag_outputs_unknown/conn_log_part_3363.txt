- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.212.136 on port 51235 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
