- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.236.50 on port 21379 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
