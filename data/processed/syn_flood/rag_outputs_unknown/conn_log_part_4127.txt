- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.217.138 on port 16831 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to classic SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), which exhausts server resources and disrupts legitimate traffic.
