- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.136.18 on port 5555 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
