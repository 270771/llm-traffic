- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32700 to 133.250.174.182:30501 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
