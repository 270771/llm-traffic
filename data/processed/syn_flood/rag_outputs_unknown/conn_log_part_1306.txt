- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63096 to 133.118.150.209:15002 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN without ACK or completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for repeated attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.
