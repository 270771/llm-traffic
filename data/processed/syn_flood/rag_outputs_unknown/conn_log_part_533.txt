- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.68.9 on port 4730 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.68.9 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly context but clear SYN flood signature.
