- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:44829 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing characteristics consistent with SYN flood (high SYN rate, zero established connections, RSTR flags observed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and apply rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to port 23 on 202.152.173.202 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic documentation, the alert details indicate a classic SYN flood pattern: numerous SYN attempts without successful connection establishment, and RSTR (reset) flags suggesting connection refusals. Port 23 (Telnet) is a common target for attacks. Immediate investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to prevent service disruption.
