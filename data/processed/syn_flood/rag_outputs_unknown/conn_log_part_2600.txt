- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.61.26 on port 16092 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) without established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.61.26 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
