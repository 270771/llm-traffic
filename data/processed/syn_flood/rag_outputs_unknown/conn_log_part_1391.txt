- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:65108 to 163.21.72.28:32001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.72.28. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
