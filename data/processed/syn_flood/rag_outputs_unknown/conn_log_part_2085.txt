- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.134.44 on port 51007 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate further investigation to confirm attack scope.
