- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.211.134 on port 5986 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent and no established sessions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK received), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
