- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64146 to 133.118.75.151:12456 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs with zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to protect the target server.
