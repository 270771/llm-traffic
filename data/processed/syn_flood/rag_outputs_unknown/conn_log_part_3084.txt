- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43934 to 203.65.81.85:10258 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
