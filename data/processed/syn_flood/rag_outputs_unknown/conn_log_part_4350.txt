- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 36953 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 shows suspicious TCP behavior with a high anomaly score (0.800906) and multiple retransmissions (RSTR flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the high anomaly score and RSTR flags strongly indicate SYN flood behavior.)
