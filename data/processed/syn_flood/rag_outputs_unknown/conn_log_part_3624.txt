- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32499 to 133.250.162.46:32444 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S, state S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed pattern of a SYN packet without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
