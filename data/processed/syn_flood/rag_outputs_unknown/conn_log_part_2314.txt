- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with repeated SYN flags and no successful handshake, indicated by RSTR (reset) responses and short session durations.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on a sensitive port (Telnet, port 23) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
