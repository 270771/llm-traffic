- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:13443 to 133.118.2.106:5984 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state). Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, this behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics: overwhelming a target with half-open TCP connections to exhaust resources. Without explicit anomaly data, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation approach is warranted.
