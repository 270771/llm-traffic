- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19222 to 133.118.28.143:1025 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s SYN-only connection attempts with zero completions (S0) are a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, consistent with standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
