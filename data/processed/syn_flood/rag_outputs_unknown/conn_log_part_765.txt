- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 163.21.222.250:14147 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
