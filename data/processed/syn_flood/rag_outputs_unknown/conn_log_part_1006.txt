- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33047 to 163.21.181.59:12243 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 bytes acknowledged, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
