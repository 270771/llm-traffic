- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.64.229 on port 1723 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and monitor traffic to port 1723; consider rate-limiting or blocking if further suspicious behavior is observed.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the SYN flood pattern (S0 flag, many SYNs without ACKs) justifies proactive investigation.)
