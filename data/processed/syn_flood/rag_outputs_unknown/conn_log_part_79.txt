- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.67.83 on port 16036 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with repeated SYNs and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, indicating resource exhaustion attempts.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
