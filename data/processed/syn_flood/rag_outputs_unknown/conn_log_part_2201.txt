- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55887 to 133.118.149.194:12111 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
