- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.248.160 on port 30010 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect target resources.
