- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs, indicating a potential SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—multiple SYN packets without handshake completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation of the source IP for potential blocking.
