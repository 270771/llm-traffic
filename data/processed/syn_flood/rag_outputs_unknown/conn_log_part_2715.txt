- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.252.106 on port 113, characterized by multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags (S0) and connection behavior (single SYNs without completion).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
