- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high source port 63874 targeting destination 8.34.37.255 port 80 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, SADTF) and a high anomaly score (0.981610) with 490 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s high anomaly score (0.981610) and SYN flood flag pattern strongly indicate a SYN flood attack consistent with typical TCP SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets sent without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target port 80.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 157.161.40.85 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the destination server.
