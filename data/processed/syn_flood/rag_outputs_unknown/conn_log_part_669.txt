- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending numerous TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating incomplete handshakes (SYN flag set, no ACK), consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
