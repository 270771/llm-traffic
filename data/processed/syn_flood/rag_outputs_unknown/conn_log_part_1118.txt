- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show abnormal behavior with a high rate of RSTR (reset) responses and short session durations.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic patterns closely; consider rate-limiting connections to port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
