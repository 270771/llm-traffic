- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19330 to 203.65.20.226:4242 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
