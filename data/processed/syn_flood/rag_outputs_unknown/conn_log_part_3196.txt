- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60784 to 203.65.74.165:11001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to protect the target server.
