- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.236.202 on port 3001 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0, count 1).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of a SYN packet without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 3001 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
