- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53856 to 133.118.231.169:10045 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of numerous SYN packets without any completed handshake (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
