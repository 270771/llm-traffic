- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:22601 to 163.21.240.106:4786 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood attack patterns documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 4786 to mitigate impact.
