- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42632 to 133.118.93.114:54857 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s SYN-only connection attempts with zero completions strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
