- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.155.110 on port 6667 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
