- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.9.12 on port 36984 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no response).  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and protect target server 163.21.9.12. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
