- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.67.5 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
