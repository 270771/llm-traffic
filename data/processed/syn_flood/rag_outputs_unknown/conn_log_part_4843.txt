- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F) and a high count of SYN packets (40) without corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly record, the observed SYN flood characteristics (high SYN count, no ACKs, suspicious flag pattern) justify immediate rate-limiting of connections from 107.81.9.228 and blocking if the behavior persists to protect the target on port 23 (Telnet).
