- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.140.80 on port 9711 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Initiate further investigation on this IP for malicious activity.
