- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F flags, multiple SYNs, zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed TCP flag pattern and connection attempts to port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further for potential coordinated attack.
