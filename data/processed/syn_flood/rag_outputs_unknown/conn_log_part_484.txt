- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior (multiple SYNs without handshake completion) targeting a known service port (23 - Telnet).
