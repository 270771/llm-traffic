- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.11.1 on port 2332 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
