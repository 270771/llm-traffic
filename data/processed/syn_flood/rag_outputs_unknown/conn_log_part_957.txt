- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN and handshake failure (SH), with a high count of initial SYN attempts (40) and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further for potential coordinated attack.
