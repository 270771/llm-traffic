- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21844 to 133.118.133.171:50008 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs overwhelm the target.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system’s resources.
