- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:32285 to 163.21.102.202:9291 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs or connection completions.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 163.21.102.202:9291 from resource exhaustion and service disruption.
