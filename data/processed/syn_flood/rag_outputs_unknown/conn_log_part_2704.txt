- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.127.68 on port 44510 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
