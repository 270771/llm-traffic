- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.55.88 on port 12222 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
