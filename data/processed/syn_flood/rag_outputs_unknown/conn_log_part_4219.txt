- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.58.71 on port 6666 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
