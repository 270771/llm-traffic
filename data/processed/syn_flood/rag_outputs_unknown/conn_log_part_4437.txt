- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.176.174 on port 17000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further threat intelligence.
