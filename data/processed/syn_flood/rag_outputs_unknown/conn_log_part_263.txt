- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.197.76:1311 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
