- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24366 to 133.250.147.59:2404 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly record and heuristic context, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
