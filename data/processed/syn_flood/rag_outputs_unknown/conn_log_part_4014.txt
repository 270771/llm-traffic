- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.190.55 on port 5986 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous S0 states (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood, as it reflects half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.190.55 port 5986. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
