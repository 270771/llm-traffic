- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard network security understanding.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further resource exhaustion on the target and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
