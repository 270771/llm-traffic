- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.99.82 on port 16089 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no response).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
