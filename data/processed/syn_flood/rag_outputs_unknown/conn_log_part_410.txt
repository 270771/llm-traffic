- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:4006 to 203.65.29.167:6001 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 203.65.29.167. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
