- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 133.250.155.50:58017 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with zero payload and minimal handshake progress, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (numerous incomplete TCP handshakes with OTH flag and zero payload) aligns with typical SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 133.250.155.50 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
