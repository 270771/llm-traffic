- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42921 to 133.250.83.2:12303 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, zero successful connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
