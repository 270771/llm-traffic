- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41234 to 163.21.150.221:18225 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
