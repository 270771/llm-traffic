- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.89.216 on port 9051 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a definitive indicator of a SYN flood attack.
