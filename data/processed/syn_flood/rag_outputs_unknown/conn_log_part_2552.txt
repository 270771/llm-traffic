- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.73.253 on port 18109 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
