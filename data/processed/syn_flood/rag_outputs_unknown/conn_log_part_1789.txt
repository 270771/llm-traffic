- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59342 to 203.65.61.185:17082 with SYN flag set, no response, and connection state S0 indicating a SYN sent but no reply.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
