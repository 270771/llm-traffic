- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.119.23:84 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous SYN packets without handshake completion.
