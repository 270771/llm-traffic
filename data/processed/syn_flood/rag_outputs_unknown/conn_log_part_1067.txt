- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2417 to 133.118.60.47:9283 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
