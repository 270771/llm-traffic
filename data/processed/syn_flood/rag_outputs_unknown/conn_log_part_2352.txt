- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 163.21.149.76:4324 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with zero packets and minimal data, consistent with incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous half-open connections with OTH flags and zero payload—align with known SYN flood behavior patterns documented in standard cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming connections from 163.21.149.76 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
