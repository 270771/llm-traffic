- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.169.19 on ports 38266 to 51106 shows 253 SYN packets over 4.5 seconds with no established connections, ending in RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a high volume of SYN packets without successful connection establishment, a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. The presence of many resets (RSTR) indicates the target is rejecting or unable to complete connections, consistent with resource exhaustion attempts. Without explicit anomaly data, investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
