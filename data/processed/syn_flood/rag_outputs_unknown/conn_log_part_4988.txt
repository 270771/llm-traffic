  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a high number of SYN packets (44) with no successful connection establishment (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the pattern itself is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
