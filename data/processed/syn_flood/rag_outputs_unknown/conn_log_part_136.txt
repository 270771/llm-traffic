- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
