- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:35155 to 163.21.150.248:30701 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYNs and zero completions is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous connection attempts without handshake completion, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
