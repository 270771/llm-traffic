- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.29.1 on port 55553 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
