- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29921 to 133.118.199.168:19 showing S0 state with only 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as single SYN with no handshake completion (S0) is indicative of SYN flood behavior.
