- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:8323 to 163.21.29.174:8545 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous SYN packets without completion.
