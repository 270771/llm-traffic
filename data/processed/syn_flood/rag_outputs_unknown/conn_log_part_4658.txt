- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.15.45 on port 1741 with SYN packets but no established connections (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—SYN packets sent without completing the handshake (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP connections. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
