- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3399 to 133.250.110.129:50012 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the S0 flag and zero completed connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
