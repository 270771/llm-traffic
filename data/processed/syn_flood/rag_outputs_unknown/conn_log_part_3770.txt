- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5659 to 133.118.121.161:12347 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
