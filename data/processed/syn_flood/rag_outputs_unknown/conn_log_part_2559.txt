- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.178.146 on port 11002 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Implement rate-limiting on port 11002 to mitigate potential service disruption.
