- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27727 to 163.21.204.22:12165 showing a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of a SYN packet without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the source IP to protect resources.
