- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 59085 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN flood behavior due to repeated SYN packets without completion, which is consistent with SYN flood attack patterns. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
