- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 203.65.10.184 on port 2404 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
