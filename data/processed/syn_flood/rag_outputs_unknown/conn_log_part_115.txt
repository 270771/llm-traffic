- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.252.22 on port 32764 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for repeated attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
