- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38221 to 163.21.229.134:16056 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—excessive half-open connections designed to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect server availability. Initiate investigation on source to assess potential compromise or malicious intent.
