- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29120 to 133.118.229.139:9222 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
