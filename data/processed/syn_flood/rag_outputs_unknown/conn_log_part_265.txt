- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.138.49 on port 175 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
