- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47723 to 163.21.229.111:17774 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of an S0 flag with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
