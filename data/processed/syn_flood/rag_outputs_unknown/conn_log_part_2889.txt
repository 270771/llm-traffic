- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51695 to 163.21.48.86:43009 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to 163.21.48.86:43009 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
