- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.148.106:2087 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
