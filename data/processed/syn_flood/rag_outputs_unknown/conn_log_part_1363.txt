- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 initiated numerous TCP SYN packets to destination 133.118.156.99 on port 175, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator requiring prompt mitigation.
