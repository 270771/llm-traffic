- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43788 to 133.118.104.130:35153 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
