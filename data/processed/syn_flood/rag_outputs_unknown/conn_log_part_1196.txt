- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.193.144 on port 4730 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
