- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.0.58 on port 17 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of a SYN packet with no handshake completion (S0) indicates a likely SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target.
