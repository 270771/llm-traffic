- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:20063 to 163.21.161.168:16098 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect target 163.21.161.168. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
