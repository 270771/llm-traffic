- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid RSTR responses and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated TCP connection attempts with immediate RSTR (reset) flags and no established connections strongly indicates a SYN flood or scanning behavior targeting port 23 (Telnet). Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if activity persists to prevent resource exhaustion. Also, investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
