- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with abnormal connection behavior (high SYN rate, zero successful connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for potential malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators: numerous SYN attempts with no successful handshakes (RSTR flag and zero established connections). This behavior disrupts normal TCP connection establishment, consistent with SYN flood attacks. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
