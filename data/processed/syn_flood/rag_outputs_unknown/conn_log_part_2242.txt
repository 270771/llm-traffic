- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.77.183 on port 2081 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous half-open connections (S0 flag) causing resource exhaustion.
