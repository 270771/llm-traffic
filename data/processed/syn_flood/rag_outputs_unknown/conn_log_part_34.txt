- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic, as the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior (high SYN rate, no ACKs) targeting a vulnerable service (port 23 - Telnet).
