- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.48.199 on port 26 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and zero completions) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by resource exhaustion attempts.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate the source for malicious activity.
