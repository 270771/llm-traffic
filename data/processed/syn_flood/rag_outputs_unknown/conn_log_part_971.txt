- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57755 to 202.44.224.65:10039 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating SYN packets sent without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server.
