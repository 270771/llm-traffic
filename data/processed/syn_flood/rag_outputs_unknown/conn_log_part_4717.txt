- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.81.250 on port 11180 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
