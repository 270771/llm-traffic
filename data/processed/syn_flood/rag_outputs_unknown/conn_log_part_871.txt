- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43136 to 133.118.24.71:16097 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, consistent with known TCP connection flood patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
