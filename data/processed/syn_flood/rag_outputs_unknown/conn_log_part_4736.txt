- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32226 to 133.118.12.116:12411 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
