- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30768 to 133.250.85.140:18027 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, F flags, zero established connections) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
