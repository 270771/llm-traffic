- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.90 on port 10000 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion and RSTR responses is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
