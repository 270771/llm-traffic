- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.184.170 on port 12294 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet count with zero completions strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect server availability.
