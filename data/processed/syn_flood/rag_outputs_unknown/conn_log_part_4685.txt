- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20131 to 202.44.227.70:587 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
