- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.180.206 on port 3749 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
