- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.182.180 on port 21258 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
