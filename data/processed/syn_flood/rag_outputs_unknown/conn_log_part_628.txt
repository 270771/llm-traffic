- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30787 to 133.250.124.14:53485 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
