- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.40.173 on port 10254 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature that exhausts server resources.
