- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.152.173.30 on port 9299 show repeated SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple connection resets (REJ), indicating a high rate of half-open connections consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record available; however, the pattern of zero completed connections combined with repeated resets and high SYN rate is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent denial of service on port 9299.
