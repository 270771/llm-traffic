- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard network security understanding.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server on port 23.
