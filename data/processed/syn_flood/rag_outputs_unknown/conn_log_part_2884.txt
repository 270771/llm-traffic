- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.114.96 on port 5000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on target.
