- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.250.80.246:902 with SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
