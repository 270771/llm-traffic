- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.49.15 on port 18035 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.49.15 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for manual investigation due to lack of anomaly context but clear SYN flood pattern (multiple SYNs with no ACKs).
