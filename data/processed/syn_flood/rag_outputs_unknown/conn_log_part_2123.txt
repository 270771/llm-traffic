- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 (port 42302) to destination IP 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
