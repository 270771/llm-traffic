- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36465 to 163.21.78.226:45786 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero established connections) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
