- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.232.233 on port 771 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or response) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for repeated attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
