- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.12.220 on port 8889 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.12.220 port 8889 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
