- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.109.158 on port 26 with S0 flag indicating connection attempts without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 flag) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
