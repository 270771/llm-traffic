- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51536 to 203.65.27.61:16089 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no ACK or completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated half-open connections; consider blocking if volume persists.
