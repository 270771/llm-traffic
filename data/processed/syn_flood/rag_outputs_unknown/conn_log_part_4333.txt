- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 31802 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 133.250.81.156 on port 993, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the destination server.
