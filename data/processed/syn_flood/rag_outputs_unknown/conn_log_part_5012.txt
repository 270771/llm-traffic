- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.165.233 on port 3128 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
