- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31231 to 203.65.93.210:4064 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
