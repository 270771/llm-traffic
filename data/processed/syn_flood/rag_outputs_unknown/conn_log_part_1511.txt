- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.9.213 on port 2323 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
