- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 157.161.40.85 to destination 8.34.37.255 on port 80, showing high SYN packet rate (490 packets) with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 157.161.40.85 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
