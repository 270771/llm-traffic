- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.128.241 on port 4369 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
