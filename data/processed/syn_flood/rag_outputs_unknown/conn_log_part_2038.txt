- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.92.200:5985 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.92.200 port 5985. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
