- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.20.175 on port 10243 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
