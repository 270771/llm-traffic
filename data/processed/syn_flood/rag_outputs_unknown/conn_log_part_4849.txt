- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.6.85 on port 52869 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
