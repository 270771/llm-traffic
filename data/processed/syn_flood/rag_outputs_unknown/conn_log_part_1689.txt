- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9891 to 202.44.230.185:40894 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
