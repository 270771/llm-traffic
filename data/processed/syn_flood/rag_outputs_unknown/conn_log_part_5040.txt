- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.157.214:55442 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the S0 flag indicates a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake, a classic sign of SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
