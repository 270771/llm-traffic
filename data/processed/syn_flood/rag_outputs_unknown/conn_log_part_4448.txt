- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.84 on port 515 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR flags within 5 seconds.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.84 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity due to abnormal connection patterns and lack of handshake completion.
