- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.230.126 on port 5269 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the connection state pattern (S0) and packet counts strongly align with known SYN flood behavior, where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
