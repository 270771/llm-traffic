- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.136.241 on port 2332 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYN packets and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
