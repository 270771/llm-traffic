- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.157.41 on port 16010 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
