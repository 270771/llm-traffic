- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.136.74:5901 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state flags (S0) and packet counts.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target port 5901. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
