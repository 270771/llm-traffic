- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.70.206 on port 12267 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood pattern. However, the presence of a SYN packet without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt, where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated incomplete connections; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
