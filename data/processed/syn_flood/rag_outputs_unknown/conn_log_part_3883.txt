- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by RSTR (reset) flags and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets and no connection establishment on a sensitive port (23 - Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and investigate source for potential blocking to prevent denial of service.
