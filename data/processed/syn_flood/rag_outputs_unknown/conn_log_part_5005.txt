- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from source 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with a high frequency (3.666407 seconds interval) and multiple SYN flags without corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
