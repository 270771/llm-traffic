- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.159.198 on port 79, showing multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion).
