- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.200.76 on port 37 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
