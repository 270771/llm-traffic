- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5158 to 133.118.123.242:18096 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
