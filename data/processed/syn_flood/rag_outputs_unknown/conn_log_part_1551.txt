- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.96.240 on port 51235 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
