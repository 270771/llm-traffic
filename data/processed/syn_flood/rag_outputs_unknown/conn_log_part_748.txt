- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41784 to 133.250.180.32:12275 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the presence of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent resource exhaustion.
