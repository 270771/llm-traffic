- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.98 on port 9160 show 38 SYN packets with zero successful handshakes, followed by RST responses, indicating connection refusal or reset.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as multiple SYNs without handshake completion and RST responses are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns.
