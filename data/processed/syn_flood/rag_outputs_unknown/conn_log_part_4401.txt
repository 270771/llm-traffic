- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19330 to 203.65.99.122:2761 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for unusual SYN packet volume and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding connection establishment (S0), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
