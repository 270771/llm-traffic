- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.49.119 on port 4664 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
