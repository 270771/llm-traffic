- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42777 to 163.21.204.38:12241 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high count of such attempts (44) strongly align with typical SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
