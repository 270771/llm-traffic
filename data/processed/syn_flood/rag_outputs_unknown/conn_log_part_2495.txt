- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:58317 to 203.65.4.103:12479 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 flag with multiple packets and no established connection), which is a known SYN flood signature. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
