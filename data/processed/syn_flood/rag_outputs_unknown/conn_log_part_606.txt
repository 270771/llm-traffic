- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 138.7.47.157 to 163.21.148.140 on port 7 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 138.7.47.157 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
