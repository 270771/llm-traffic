- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.219.193 on port 55443 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
