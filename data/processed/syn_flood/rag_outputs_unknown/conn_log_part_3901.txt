- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:48291 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing RSTR (Reset) response with zero successful handshakes and multiple retransmissions within a short interval.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no established connections and RST responses is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service on port 23 (Telnet).
