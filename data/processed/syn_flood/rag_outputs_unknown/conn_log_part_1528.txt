- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.83.255 on port 12329 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
