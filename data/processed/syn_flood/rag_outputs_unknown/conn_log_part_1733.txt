- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.135.130 on port 18081 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed TCP flags and connection pattern (SYN sent, no response) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
