- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 37044 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (high SYN packets with no ACKs) on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent service disruption and investigate further network logs for related activity.
