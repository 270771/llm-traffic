- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.245.110:21025 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
