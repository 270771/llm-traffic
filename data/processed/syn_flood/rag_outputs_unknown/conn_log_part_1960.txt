- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:60028 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing characteristics consistent with SYN flood (high SYN rate, no established connections, RSTR flags observed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert details indicate a classic SYN flood pattern: numerous SYN attempts without successful handshakes, targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet, often exploited). The presence of RSTR (Reset) flags and zero established connections confirms the connection attempts are being refused or dropped, consistent with SYN flood behavior. Given the high risk and typical impact of SYN floods, decisive blocking is warranted.
