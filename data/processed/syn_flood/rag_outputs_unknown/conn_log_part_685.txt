- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show zero successful handshakes and multiple reset responses (RSTR), indicating incomplete TCP sessions consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without established connections and immediate resets is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks targeting port 23 (Telnet), a known vulnerable service.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and rate-limit incoming SYN packets to port 23 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat intelligence.
