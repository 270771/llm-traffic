- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting destination 202.152.168.83 on port 102 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
