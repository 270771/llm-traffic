- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (indicated by flags and counts) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted.
