- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.1.91 on port 2121 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate, but the observed pattern (SYN sent, no response, repeated attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 2121 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
