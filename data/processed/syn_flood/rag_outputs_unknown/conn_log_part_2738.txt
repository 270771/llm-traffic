- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 133.118.80.202:50100 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
