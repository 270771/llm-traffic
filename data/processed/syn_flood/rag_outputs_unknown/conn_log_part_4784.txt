- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.48.160 on port 19016 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion strongly align with known SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect target server 163.21.48.160. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
