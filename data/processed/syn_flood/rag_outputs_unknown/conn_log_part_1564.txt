- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 (source port 59816) to 202.44.236.247 (destination port 16037) show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or completions, indicating half-open connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
