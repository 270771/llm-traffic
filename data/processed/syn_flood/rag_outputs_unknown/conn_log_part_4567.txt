- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.187.214 on port 9441 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent and no responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
