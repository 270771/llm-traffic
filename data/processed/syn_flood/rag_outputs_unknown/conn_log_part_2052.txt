- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 167.249.133.167 (port 43989) to destination IP 202.44.213.71 (port 21255) show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
