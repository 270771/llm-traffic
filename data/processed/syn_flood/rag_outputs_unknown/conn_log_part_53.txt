- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61804 to 133.250.153.166:9779 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server at 133.250.153.166:9779.
