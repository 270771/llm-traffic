- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.248.3 on port 7071 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
