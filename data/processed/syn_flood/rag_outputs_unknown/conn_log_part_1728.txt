- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14851 to 203.65.3.114:12126 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
