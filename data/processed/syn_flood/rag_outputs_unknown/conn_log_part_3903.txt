- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.187:39208 to 203.65.103.15:5256 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful connections, resulting in REJ (rejection) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.187 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited. However, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no established connections and REJ responses is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
