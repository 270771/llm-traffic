- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:32335 to 133.250.136.57:264 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
