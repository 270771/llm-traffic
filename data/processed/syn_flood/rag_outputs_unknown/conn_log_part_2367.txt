- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.160.125 on port 29984 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
