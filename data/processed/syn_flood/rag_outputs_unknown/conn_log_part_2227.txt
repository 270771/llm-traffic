- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36451 to 163.21.241.157:21236 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood attacks.
