- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23, showing rapid connection attempts with no successful handshake completion (indicated by RSTR flags and zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the alert’s characteristics (high SYN rate, no handshake completion, RSTR flags) are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns and warrant decisive blocking action.
