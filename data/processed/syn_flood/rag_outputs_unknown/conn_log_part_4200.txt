- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.212.171 on port 2332 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.212.171 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
