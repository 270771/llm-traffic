- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.151.235 shows multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect resources.
