- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.17.221 on port 8834 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
