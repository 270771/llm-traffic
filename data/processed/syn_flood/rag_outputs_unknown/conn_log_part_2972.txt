- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13631 to 133.250.160.253:9400 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, as SYN flood attacks exploit the TCP handshake by sending numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 133.250.160.253:9400 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
