- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.100.145 on port 16047 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.100.145 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly context but clear SYN flood signature.
