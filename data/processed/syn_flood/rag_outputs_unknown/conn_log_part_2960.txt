- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.102.7 on port 9315 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is available to definitively confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and precautionary rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
