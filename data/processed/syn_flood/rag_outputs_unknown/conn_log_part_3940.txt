- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46193 to 133.250.163.73:17001 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
