- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.5.253:8098 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
