- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:12068 to 133.118.142.75:12414 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets without ACK responses.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
