- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.248.31 on port 9943 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, consistent with standard threat models.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
