- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.68.246 on port 65432 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), and only 1 connection attempt with 44 bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
