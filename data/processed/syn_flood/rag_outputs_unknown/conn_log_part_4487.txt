- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.253.119 on port 49 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
