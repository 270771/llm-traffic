- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28961 to 133.118.156.60:771 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag with SYN packets and zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
