- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:57527 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN packets with no established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and apply rate-limiting on port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN attempts without successful handshakes and reset flags—targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), a known attack vector. Immediate investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to prevent service disruption.
