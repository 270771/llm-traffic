- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.74.236 on port 20082 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.74.236. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
