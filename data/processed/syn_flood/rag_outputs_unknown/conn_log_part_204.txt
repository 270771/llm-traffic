- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.68.218 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero successful connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
