- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack aimed at exhausting server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and block if the behavior persists to prevent denial of service on port 23. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
