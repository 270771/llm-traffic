- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.79.19:8140 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
