- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 (port 52014) targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs) targeting a vulnerable service (port 23, typically Telnet). Without anomaly data, proactive blocking is warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
