- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.151.197 on port 9600 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly detection.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
