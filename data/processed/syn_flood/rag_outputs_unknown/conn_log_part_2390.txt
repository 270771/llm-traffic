- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.61.81 on port 3780 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential blocking.
