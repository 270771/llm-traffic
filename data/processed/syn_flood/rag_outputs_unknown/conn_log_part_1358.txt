- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:43245 to 133.118.14.84:12138 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
