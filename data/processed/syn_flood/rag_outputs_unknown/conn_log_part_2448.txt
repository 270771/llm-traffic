- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.238.218 on port 515 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero completions strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
