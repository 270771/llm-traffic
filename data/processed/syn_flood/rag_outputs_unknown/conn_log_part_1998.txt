- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29585 to 202.44.206.70:9195 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood behavior—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
