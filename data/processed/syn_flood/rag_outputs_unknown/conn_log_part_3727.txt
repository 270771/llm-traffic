- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.241.107 on port 9042 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
