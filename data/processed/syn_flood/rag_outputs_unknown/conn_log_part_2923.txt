- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.106.80 on port 38880 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is confirmed.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly records or heuristics are available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of SYN packets without corresponding connection completions (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
