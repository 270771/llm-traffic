- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.28.186 on port 2083 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the SYN flood pattern (S0 flag, no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
