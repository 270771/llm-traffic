- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.19.172:5986 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, no established connections, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall and enable rate-limiting on port 5986 to mitigate further SYN flood attempts. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
