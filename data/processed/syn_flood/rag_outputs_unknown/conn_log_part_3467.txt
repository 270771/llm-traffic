- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.188.201:81 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN requests without corresponding ACKs, overwhelming the target’s connection queue.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
