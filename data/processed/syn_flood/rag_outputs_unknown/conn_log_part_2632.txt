- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:26732 to 133.118.13.222:10393 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without handshake completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the source IP to protect target resources.
