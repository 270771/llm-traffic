- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid connection attempts (3.5 seconds interval, 3 attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs to a sensitive port (Telnet, port 23) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 immediately and monitor for further suspicious activity.
