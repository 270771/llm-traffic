- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53955 to 133.118.98.246:12500 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response or completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
