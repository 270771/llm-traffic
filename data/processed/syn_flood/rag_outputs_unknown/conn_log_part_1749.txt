- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 56632 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (3.04 seconds duration, multiple SYN packets, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further for potential coordinated attack.
