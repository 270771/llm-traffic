- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high ephemeral port 38830 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating SYN flood pattern (SH, F, F, 0, F, 1, 40).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the traffic pattern—numerous SYN packets to port 23 (commonly targeted for Telnet exploits) with suspicious TCP flag combinations—strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 and rate-limit incoming SYN packets to port 23 to mitigate potential service disruption. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat intelligence.
