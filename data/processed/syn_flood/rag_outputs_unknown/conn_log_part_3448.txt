- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.104.197 on port 49 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet without response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and monitor traffic volume; if high-rate SYN attempts persist, implement rate-limiting or block IP to prevent potential SYN flood attack.
