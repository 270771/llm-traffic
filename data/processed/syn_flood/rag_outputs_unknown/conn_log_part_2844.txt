- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.166.152 on port 3542 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
