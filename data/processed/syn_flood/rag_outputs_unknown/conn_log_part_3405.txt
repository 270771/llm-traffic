- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.86.210 on port 47984 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
