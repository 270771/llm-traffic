- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.189.198 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion).
