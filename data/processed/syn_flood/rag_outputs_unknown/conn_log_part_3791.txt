- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38173 to 163.21.148.172:11110 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 packets, 1 connection attempt, zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
