- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with no successful handshake, high SYN rate, and RSTR (reset) responses indicating connection refusal or reset.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the high SYN rate and reset responses strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt despite lack of anomaly data.
