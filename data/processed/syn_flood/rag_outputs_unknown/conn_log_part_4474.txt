- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.38.119 on port 2379 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
