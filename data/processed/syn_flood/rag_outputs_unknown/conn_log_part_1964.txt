- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 202.152.168.83 on port 102 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake (indicated by flags and zero ACKs) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
