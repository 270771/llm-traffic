- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.22.222 on port 1400 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
