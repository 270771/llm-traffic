- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14817 to 133.118.51.31:12587 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics by definition.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If sustained, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
