- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.104.55 on port 7071 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
