- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.93.142 on ports 26825 → 20184 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and enable rate-limiting on the targeted ports to mitigate the SYN flood impact.
