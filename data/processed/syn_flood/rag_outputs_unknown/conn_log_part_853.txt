- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.86.248 on port 2121 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
