- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 initiated a TCP connection flood against destination 202.44.220.177 on port 102, with multiple SYN packets sent without completing handshakes (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (SYN packets without ACK) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation to identify potential attack scope.
