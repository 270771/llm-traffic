- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.42.217 on port 10055 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
