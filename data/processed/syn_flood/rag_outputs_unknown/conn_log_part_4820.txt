- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44347 to 163.21.52.47:21312 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
