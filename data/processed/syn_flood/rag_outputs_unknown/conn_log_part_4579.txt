- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:15433 to 203.65.102.100:445 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior targeting port 445 (commonly SMB service), which is a known attack vector.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to port 445 on 203.65.102.100 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
