- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:43806 to 202.152.173.202:23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge, as the absence of handshake and RSTR responses suggest potential SYN flood behavior despite lack of formal anomaly data.
