- SYN flood alert: Connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (multiple SYN packets with no completion).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
