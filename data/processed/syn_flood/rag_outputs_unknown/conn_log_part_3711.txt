- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.18.121:9000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server at 163.21.18.121:9000. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
