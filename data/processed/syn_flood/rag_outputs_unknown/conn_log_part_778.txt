- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.45.144 on port 29840 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 state strongly indicates SYN flood behavior despite lack of anomaly data.
