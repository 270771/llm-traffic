- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.238.246 on port 18245 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
