- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.64.13 on port 9009 with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), 44 attempts, no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the connection pattern (many SYNs without responses) is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
