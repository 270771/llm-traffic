- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:5277 to 163.21.27.61:45821 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet count (44 SYNs with zero completions) strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
