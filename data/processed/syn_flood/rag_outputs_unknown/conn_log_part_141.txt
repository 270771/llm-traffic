- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.17.1 on port 18003 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, as the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
