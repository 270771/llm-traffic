- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.158.83 on port 81 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
