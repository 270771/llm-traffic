- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25714 to 133.250.76.225:18088 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0 state, single SYN packet, no response) align with classic SYN flood indicators documented in standard network security practices.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
