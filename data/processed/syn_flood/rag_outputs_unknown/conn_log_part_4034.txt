- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F flags, zero ACKs, and multiple SYNs without completion).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system.
