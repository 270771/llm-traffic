- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:47131 to 133.118.179.181:21296 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert indicates a SYN packet sent without completing the TCP handshake (S0 state), which is a classic sign of a SYN flood attempt. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Given the nature of SYN floods, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
