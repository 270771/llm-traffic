- SYN flood alert: Connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.11.92 on TCP port 16040 shows S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag with no established connections is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
