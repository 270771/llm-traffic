- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) flags, indicating connection refusals.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior; implement rate-limiting on port 23 to mitigate possible attack while further data is collected.
