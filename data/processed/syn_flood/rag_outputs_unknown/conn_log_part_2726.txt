- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44810 to 163.21.78.128:21305 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
