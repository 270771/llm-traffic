- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.44.6 on port 21297 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
