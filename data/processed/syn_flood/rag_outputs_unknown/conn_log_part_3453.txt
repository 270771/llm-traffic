- SYN flood alert: Connection from 167.249.133.167 (source port 36099) to 202.44.244.195 (destination port 12213) shows TCP flag S0 with 1 SYN packet sent and 44 bytes transferred, indicating an incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
