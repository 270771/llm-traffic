- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.68.50:2480 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake (S0 state), which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Without anomaly records or heuristics, confirmation is limited, but proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted given the nature of the alert.
