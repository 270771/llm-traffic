- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending multiple TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with no corresponding ACKs, indicating a potential SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 and initiate investigation of the source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood behavior—multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (ACKs). This pattern is a well-known threat that can exhaust server resources. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate impact.
