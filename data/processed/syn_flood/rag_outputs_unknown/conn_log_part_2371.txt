- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.25.107 on port 51000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect server availability. Initiate investigation on source to assess potential compromise or malicious intent.
