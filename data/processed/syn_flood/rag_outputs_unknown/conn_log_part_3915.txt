- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.183.236 on port 16042 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows a classic SYN flood symptom (many SYNs without completion), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
