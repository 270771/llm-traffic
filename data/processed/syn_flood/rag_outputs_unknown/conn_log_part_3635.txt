- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41378 to 203.65.13.226:9198 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), 44 attempts, 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
