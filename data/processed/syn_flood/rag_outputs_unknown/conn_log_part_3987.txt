- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.100.156 on port 20002 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
