- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.120.93 on port 12190 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (flag S0), indicating an incomplete handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag indicates a SYN packet sent without completion of the TCP handshake, a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP connection heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
