- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting destination 203.65.59.216 on port 8443 with TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), 44 connection attempts, zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
