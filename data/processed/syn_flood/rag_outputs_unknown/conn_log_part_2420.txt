- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.203.120 on port 7218 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion on the target server.
