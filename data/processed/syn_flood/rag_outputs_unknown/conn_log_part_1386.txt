- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26492 to 202.44.235.2:5025 with SYN flag set and no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) are indicative of SYN flood behavior.
