- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:33801 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no successful handshake (RSTR flag observed, zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics: numerous SYN attempts without completing handshakes, indicated by zero ACKs and RSTR flags. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aiming to exhaust server resources. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
