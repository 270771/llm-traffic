- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.160.151 on port 9245 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns from this IP.
