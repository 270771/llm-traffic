- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23370 to 133.250.86.182:18075 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
