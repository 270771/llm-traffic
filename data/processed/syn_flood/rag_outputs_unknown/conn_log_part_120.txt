- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.80.112 on port 12206 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
