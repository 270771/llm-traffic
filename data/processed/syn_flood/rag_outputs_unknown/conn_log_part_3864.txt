- SYN flood alert: Source IP 163.21.64.150 is initiating a high volume of TCP SYN packets to destination 13.111.136.41 on port 443, with a significant number of half-open connections (indicated by SYN flood flag SF and counts 1530 and 5484).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this behavior as a known anomaly pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the volume and pattern of SYN packets strongly indicate a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 163.21.64.150 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
