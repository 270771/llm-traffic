- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:55711 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake (indicated by RSTR flag and zero established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity; implement rate-limiting on port 23 to mitigate possible TCP SYN flood attack.
