- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 133.118.139.159:53962 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 60 SYN packets and 1 connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 133.118.139.159 for unusual SYN packet volume and consider rate-limiting connections to port 636 pending further analysis.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a high number of SYN packets (60) with minimal established connections (1), consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and rate-limiting are prudent to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
