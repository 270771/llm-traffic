- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54328 to 163.21.140.153:14104 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
