- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packet from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.104.10 on port 53 with flag S0 indicating a half-open connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood behavior is confirmed.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag) and only one SYN sent suggests a potential SYN flood attempt targeting port 53 (DNS). Without anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
