- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.248.67 on port 13 show multiple SYN packets with no completion of handshake (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
