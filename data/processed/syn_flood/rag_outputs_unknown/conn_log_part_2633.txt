- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristics, the presence of multiple SYN flags without ACKs on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
