- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35807 to 163.21.154.33:16038 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
