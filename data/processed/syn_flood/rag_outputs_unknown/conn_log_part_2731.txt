- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:40728 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, given the observed failed connection attempts and reset flags indicative of SYN flood behavior.
