- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36646 to 163.21.29.23:20185 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the single SYN packet with no response (S0) and no established connection is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Recommend rate-limiting incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for repeated attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.
