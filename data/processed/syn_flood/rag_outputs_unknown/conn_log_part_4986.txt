- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:6707 to 202.44.240.60:503 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
