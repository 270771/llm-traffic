- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60399 to 133.250.79.192:12479 with SYN flag set, resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious, since SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous half-open connections (S0 state) causing resource exhaustion.
