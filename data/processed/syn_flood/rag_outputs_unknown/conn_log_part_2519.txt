- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.230.203 on port 12356 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator; immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation.
