- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.227.62 on port 53 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN packets to port 53 (DNS) with no handshake completion indicate potential SYN flood behavior.
