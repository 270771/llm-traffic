- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 (port 46311) targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets (flag SH) with no corresponding ACKs, targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet, a known attack vector). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources. Given the criticality of such attacks, proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted.
