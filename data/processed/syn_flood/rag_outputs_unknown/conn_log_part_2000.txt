- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending numerous TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F, 0, F, 1, 40).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets with suspicious flags to port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to protect the target system and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
