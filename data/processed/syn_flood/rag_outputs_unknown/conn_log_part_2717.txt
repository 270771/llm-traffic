- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.206.100 on port 16401 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
