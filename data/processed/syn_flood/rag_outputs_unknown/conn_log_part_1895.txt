- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39240 to 133.118.173.145:10181 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
