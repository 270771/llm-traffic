- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53842 to 133.118.87.134:18079 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without corresponding ACKs.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
