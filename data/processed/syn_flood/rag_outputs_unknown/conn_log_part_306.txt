- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.120 on port 4064 show a high volume of SYN packets (517) with no successful handshake completion, followed by RSTR (reset) responses, indicating connection refusal or reset.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the volume and pattern of SYN packets with no handshake completion and reset responses strongly indicate a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
