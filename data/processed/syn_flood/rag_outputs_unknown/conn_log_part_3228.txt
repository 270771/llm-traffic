- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.138.211 on port 12254 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
