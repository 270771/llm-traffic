- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:42664 to 202.152.173.202:23 show high SYN flood likelihood (score 0.950856) with no corresponding anomaly records or heuristic context available.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic context found due to lack of data.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet), as the high confidence score (0.95) strongly indicates malicious SYN flood behavior despite missing anomaly records.
