- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3958 to 133.118.119.67:12156 showing a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
