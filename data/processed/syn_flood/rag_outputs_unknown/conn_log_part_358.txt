- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.248.190 on port 7474 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if the pattern persists to prevent resource exhaustion.
