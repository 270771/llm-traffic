- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.118.155.121:221 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.155.121:221 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly context but clear SYN flood signature.
