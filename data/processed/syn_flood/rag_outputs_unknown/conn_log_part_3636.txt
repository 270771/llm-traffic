- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6315 to 163.21.59.115:12361 showing S0 flag with zero bytes transferred and only one packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if repeated SYN-only packets persist, as the S0 flag with no response typically indicates a SYN flood attempt.
