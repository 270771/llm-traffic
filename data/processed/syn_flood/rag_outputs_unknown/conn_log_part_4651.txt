- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:34367 to 163.21.251.153:35004 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
