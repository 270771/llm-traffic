- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 (source port 54526) to 202.152.173.202 port 23, showing flags consistent with SYN flood behavior (multiple SYNs, no corresponding ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement temporary blocking if traffic persists.
