- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8704 to 133.118.25.74:12492 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
