- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including rapid connection attempts and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the alert indicates potential denial-of-service attempts despite lack of anomaly data.
