- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.123.183 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
