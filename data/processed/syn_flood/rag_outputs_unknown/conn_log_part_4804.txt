- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45469 to 202.44.198.228:21301 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero completed connections strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the TCP handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target 202.44.198.228. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
