- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 163.21.153.152:21 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, as they exhaust server resources by leaving connections half-open.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 21 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
