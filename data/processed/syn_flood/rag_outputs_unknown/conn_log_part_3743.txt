- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30496 to 133.250.157.238:10068 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero established connections) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
