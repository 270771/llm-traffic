- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48075 to 133.118.210.153:12395 with SYN flag set, no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 TCP state with SYN flag and no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior and warrants proactive investigation.
