- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.32.8 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior alone are definitive indicators of SYN flood attacks in standard network security analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
