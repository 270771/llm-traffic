- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.122.131 on port 18010 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYN packets and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
