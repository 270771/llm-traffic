- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.185.26 on port 12307 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
