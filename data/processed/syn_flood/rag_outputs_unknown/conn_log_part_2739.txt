- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs on a sensitive port (23, typically Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect the target system.
