- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows characteristics typical of a SYN flood: numerous SYN attempts without completing handshakes, triggering reset responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Without explicit anomaly records, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
