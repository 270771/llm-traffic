- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.233.205 on port 10255 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state flags (S0) and packet counts.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
