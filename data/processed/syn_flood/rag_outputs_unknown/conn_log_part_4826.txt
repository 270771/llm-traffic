- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61467 to 163.21.188.34:12338 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target host 163.21.188.34 from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
