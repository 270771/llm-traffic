- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 37258 sending rapid TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.169.178 port 5984, with 252 SYN packets over 3.4 seconds and zero successful connections (RSTR flags observed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the high volume of SYN packets with no successful handshakes and presence of RSTR flags strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
