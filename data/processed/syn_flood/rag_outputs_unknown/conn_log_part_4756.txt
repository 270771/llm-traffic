- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.101.128 on port 12000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on target. Initiate further investigation on source for potential malicious activity.
