- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20458 to 203.65.59.73:21326 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 flag, 1 SYN packet sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (SYN sent without response, S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
