- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, ending in RSTR (reset) responses, indicating potential SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as repeated incomplete TCP handshakes on port 23 (Telnet) are a known vector for denial-of-service attacks.
