- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:45791 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge, as the alert alone lacks corroborating anomaly evidence.
