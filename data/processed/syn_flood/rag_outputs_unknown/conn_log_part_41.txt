- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.86.19 on port 16095 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
