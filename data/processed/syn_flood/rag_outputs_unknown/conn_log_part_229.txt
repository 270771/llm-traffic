- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.64.161 on port 82 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
