- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 45.121.111.255 to 163.21.148.140 on port 5061 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 45.121.111.255 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
