- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:47291 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN packets without completed handshakes and RSTR responses. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
