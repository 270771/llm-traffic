- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.98.176 on port 12398 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
