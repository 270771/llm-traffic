- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.64.129 on port 102 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
