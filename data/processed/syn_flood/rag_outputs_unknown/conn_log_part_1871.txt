- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 133.118.237.37 on ports 19721 → 20256, with multiple SYN packets sent without completing handshakes (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  → Action: Block source IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the observed behavior (numerous incomplete TCP handshakes) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks and poses a denial-of-service threat.
