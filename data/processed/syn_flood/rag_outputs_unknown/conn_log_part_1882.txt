- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32081 to 163.21.172.205:17020 with SYN flag set, resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 states typically indicate SYN flood behavior causing resource exhaustion.
