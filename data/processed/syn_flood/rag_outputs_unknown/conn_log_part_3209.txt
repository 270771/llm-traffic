- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.75.81 on port 5858 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or completion) aligns with classic SYN flood signatures where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
