- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.150.189 on port 10039 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
