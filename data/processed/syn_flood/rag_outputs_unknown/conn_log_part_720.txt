- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6813 to 133.250.99.179:12103 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag with SYN packets and zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
