- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.49.183 on port 9080 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
