- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:33233 to 202.152.173.202:23 with no successful handshake, high SYN rate, and RSTR flags observed.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN attempts without completion and RSTR flags indicating reset responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
