- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8444 to 133.250.126.183:9273 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets without completion.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if attack volume persists.
