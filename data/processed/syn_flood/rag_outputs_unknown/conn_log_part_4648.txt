- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.97.64 on port 12391 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
