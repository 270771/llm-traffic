- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.178.84 on port 10040 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood patterns where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
