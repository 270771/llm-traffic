- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:35663 to 163.21.127.58:12445 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
