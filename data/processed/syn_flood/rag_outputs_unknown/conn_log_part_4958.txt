- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.201.12 on port 21252 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no ACK or completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
