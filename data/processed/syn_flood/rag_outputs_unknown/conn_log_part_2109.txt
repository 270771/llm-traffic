- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.143.117 on port 12586 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
