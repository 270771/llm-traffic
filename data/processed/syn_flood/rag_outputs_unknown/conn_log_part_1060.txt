- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.217.33 on port 5222 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet without response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN-only connection with no handshake completion is characteristic of SYN flood behavior. Recommend rate-limiting connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity to prevent potential resource exhaustion.
