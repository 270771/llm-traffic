- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:27723 to 202.44.210.234:102 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no ACK or completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
