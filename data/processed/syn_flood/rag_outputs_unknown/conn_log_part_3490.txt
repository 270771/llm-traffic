- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64259 to 202.44.207.3:9797 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 202.44.207.3:9797, as the observed SYN-only connection attempts are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns.
