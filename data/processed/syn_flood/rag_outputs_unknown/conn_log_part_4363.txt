- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.186.249 on port 12532 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets sent without completion (S0 state, 44 attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and high SYN count without ACKs, which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
