- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50159 to 163.21.255.5:15006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
