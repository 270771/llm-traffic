- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.171.248 on port 7474 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
