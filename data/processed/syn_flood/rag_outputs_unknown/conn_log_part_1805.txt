- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.81.138 on port 12336 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, single SYN packet, no response) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
