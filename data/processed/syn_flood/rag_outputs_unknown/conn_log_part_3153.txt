- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.65.111 on port 8889 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8889 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
