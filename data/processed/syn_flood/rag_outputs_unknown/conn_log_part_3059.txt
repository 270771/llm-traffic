- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57713 to 133.118.165.119:44365 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with known SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
