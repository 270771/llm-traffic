- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F, zero ACKs, and multiple SYNs without completion).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood attack.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, targeting a known service port (23, Telnet). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate impact.
