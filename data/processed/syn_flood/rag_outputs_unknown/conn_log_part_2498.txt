- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.11.56 on port 465 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
