- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.150.26 on port 9000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior causing resource exhaustion.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
