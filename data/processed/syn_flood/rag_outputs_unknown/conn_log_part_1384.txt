- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.79.66 on port 32400, showing multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 32400 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement SYN cookies or other TCP stack hardening to mitigate impact.
