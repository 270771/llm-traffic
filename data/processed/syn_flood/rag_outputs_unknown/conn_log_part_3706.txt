- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.118.189:1024 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and packet pattern (SYN sent, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 133.118.118.189 from resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
