- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.108.236 on port 80 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag pattern is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
