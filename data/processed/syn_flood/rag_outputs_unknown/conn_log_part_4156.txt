- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4402 to 163.21.93.154:16401 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior, consistent with known TCP SYN flood patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
