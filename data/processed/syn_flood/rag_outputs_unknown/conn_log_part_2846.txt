- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.14.7 on port 12122 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
