- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54769 to 133.250.92.214:18023 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
