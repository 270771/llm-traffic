- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44084 to 202.44.217.25:12119 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 202.44.217.25 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
