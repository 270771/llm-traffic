- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8434 to 133.118.55.54:16067 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly or heuristic data is available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
