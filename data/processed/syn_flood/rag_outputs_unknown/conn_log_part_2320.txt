- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) flags, indicating connection refusals.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood patterns persist, as repeated connection resets and zero completions strongly indicate SYN flood activity despite lack of anomaly records.
