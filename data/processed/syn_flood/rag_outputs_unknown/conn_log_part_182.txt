- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58830 to 133.118.51.32:10302 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
