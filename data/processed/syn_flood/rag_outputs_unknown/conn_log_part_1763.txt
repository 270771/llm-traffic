- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:48577 to 163.21.219.150:12528 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
