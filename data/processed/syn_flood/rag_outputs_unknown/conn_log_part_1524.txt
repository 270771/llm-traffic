- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.165.20 on port 2000 show a high volume of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag pattern (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count (44) with zero completions strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
