- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.189.84 on port 32400 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without ACK confirm classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
