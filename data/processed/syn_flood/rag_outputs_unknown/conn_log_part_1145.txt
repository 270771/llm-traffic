- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.153.166 on port 4567 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
