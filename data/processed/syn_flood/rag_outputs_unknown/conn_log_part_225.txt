- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30341 to 202.44.231.27:11596 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood attack patterns, where attackers send SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
