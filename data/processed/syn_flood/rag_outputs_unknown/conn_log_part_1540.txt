- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.146.203 on ports 10913 → 10031 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), 44 packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect service availability.
