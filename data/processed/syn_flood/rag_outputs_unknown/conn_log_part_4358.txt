- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including a high rate of SYN packets without successful handshakes, indicated by RSTR flags and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 on 202.152.173.202 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement blocking if attack persists.
