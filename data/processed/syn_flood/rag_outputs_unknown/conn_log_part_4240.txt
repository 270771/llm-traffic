- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.197.66 on port 12168 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with numerous SYN packets and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends many SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
