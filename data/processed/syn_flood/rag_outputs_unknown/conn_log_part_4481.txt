- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:32485 to 133.118.39.62:55080 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S with no completion), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
