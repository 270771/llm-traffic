- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49347 to 203.65.122.108:12280 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (numerous SYNs without ACKs).
