- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 163.21.122.15:444 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
