- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 133.118.156.255 on ports 11786 → 16010, characterized by numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent, as the SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without handshake completion) is a well-known denial-of-service technique.
