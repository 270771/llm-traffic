- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:34128 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing OTH (other) flag with zero packets and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and monitor traffic to port 23 (Telnet), as SYN flood detection cannot be confirmed without anomaly or heuristic data. Implement rate-limiting on port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
