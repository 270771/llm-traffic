- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.36.216 on port 9002 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
