- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 157.161.40.85 to 192.222.97.152 on port 443 with 27,226 SYN packets over ~3.9 seconds, no corresponding ACKs, and TCP flags indicating half-open connections (SH).

  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 157.161.40.85 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
