- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.160.66 on port 3310 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag indicates a classic SYN flood pattern where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
