- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.18.65 on port 50101 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK response, indicating a half-open connection (S0 state) with only 1 SYN and no established connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no ACK) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
