- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate network logs for additional suspicious activity.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—multiple SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—targeting a known service port (23, Telnet). This behavior is a confirmed threat pattern warranting prompt blocking to protect the target system.
