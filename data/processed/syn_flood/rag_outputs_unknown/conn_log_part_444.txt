- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.96.233 on port 12579 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK, indicating incomplete handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the incomplete TCP handshake pattern (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
