- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:63409 to 133.118.96.220:14897 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent, as the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with many SYNs and no ACKs) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
