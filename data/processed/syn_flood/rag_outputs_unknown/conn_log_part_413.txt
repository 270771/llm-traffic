- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with 4.72 seconds duration and 160 packets, flagged with SH and F flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual SYN packet volume and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as SYN flood.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN activity consistent with SYN flood characteristics (high packet count, SYN flags). Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
