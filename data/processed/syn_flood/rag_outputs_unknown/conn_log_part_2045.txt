- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:33901 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal behavior with RSTR flag and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection patterns to port 23; consider rate-limiting or blocking if repeated connection attempts persist.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of repeated TCP connection attempts to port 23 (commonly Telnet) with RSTR (reset) flags and no successful handshakes strongly indicates a SYN flood or connection exhaustion attempt. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
