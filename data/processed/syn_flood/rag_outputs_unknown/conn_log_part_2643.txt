- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion and multiple resets on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service and investigate source for further malicious activity.
