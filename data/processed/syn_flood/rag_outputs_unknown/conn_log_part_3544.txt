- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.170.214 on port 15 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as repeated SYNs without handshake completion indicate a classic SYN flood pattern.
