- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.52.64 on port 8126 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 203.65.52.64 on port 8126 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
