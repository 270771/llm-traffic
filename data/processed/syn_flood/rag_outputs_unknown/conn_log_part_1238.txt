- SYN flood alert: Source IP 183.116.47.244 on high source port 44355 targeting destination IP 203.65.103.15 on port 1027 with TCP protocol shows repeated connection attempts resulting in REJ (connection rejected) responses, indicating potential SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 183.116.47.244 for abnormal connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as repeated rejected connection attempts on unusual ports are consistent with SYN flood attack vectors.
