- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 44379 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 shows suspicious TCP behavior with zero successful connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the pattern of repeated connection attempts with resets and no successful handshakes is consistent with SYN flood behavior and warrants proactive investigation.
