- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.152.44 on port 3001 show SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no ACK response) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 133.118.152.44 on port 3001 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
