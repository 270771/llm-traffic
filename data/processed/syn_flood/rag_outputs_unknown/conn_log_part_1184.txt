- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.112.70 on port 6653 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
