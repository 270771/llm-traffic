- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10981 to 203.65.112.166:9901 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood heuristics indicating resource exhaustion attempts.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity; if sustained, block the IP to protect target 203.65.112.166.
