- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:63083 to 133.118.103.57:14330 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and the pattern of repeated SYNs without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
