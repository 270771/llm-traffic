- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.146.5 on port 50104 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, consistent with standard TCP anomaly detection principles.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
