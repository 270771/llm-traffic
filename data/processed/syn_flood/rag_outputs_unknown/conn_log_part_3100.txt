- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32023 to 163.21.75.149:23182 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
