- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.8.184 on port 4500 with many incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the high number of SYN packets without completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attack.
