- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 202.44.206.67 on port 21256 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the presence of SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior and warrants proactive investigation and mitigation.
