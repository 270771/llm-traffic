- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.59.14:9944 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
