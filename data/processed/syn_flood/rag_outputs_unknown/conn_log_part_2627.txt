- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:19585 to 133.118.87.156:9291 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert’s pattern (high SYN count with no connection completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
