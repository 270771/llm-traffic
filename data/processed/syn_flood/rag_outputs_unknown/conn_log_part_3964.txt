- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.29.197 on port 57778 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
