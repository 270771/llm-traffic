- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.109.31 on port 37 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and high SYN count with zero completions are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
