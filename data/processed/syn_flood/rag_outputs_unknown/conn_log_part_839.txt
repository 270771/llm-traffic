- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:41113 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR response and high connection attempt rate (0.79 connections/sec), zero successful handshakes, and multiple retries.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood indicators (high connection attempts, no successful handshakes, RSTR responses), justifying proactive investigation and mitigation.
