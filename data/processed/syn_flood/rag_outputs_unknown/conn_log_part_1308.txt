- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows characteristics typical of a SYN flood attack—numerous SYN attempts without completing handshakes, triggering reset responses. This behavior disrupts normal TCP connection establishment and is a known denial-of-service tactic. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
