- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.24.20 on port 44818 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates multiple SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake (S0 flag), which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Without anomaly records or heuristics, confirmation is limited, but the behavior is consistent with SYN flood patterns. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
