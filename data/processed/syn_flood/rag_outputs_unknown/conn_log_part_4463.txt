- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32526 to 133.118.232.158:45005 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without handshake completion, overwhelming target resources.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to immediately mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
