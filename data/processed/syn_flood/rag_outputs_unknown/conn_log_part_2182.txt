- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.89.182 on port 2131 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated attempts; consider blocking if flood behavior persists.
