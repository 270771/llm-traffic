- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4843 to 203.65.36.170:18053 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
