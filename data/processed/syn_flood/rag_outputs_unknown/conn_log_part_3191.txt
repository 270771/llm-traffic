- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges, as the alert alone indicates potential SYN flood behavior due to repeated SYNs without handshake completion.
