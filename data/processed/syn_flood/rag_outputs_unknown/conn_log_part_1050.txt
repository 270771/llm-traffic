- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:59853 to 202.152.173.202:23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows characteristics typical of a SYN flood attack—numerous SYN attempts without completing handshakes, targeting port 23 (Telnet), which is often exploited. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
