- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.54.134 on port 45886 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, consistent with standard TCP/IP attack heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
