- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.66.130 on port 18102 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
