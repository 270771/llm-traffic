- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48975 to 163.21.90.211:32444 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the TCP flags and packet pattern strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt.
