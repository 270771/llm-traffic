- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:41946 to 163.21.215.205:18090 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly confirmation but clear SYN flood signature.
