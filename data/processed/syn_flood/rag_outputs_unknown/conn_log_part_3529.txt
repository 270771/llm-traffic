- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:41042 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with zero successful handshakes and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN attempts with no completed connections and reset responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting are warranted to prevent service disruption.
