- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51087 to 163.21.174.40:10036 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with a single SYN packet and no established connection is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
