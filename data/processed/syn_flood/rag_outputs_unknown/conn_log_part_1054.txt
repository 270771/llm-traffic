- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.105.240 on port 4786 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server 203.65.105.240. Conduct further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
