- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 29011 is initiating numerous TCP connections to destination 133.250.155.226 on port 3000, with a high count of SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
