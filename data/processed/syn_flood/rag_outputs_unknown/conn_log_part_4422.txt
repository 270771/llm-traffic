- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:47153 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and zero successful handshakes, indicating potential SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the presence of RSTR flags and zero successful connections strongly suggests SYN flood activity.)
