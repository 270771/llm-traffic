- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 163.21.179.221:30254 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 60 SYN packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 163.21.179.221 for unusual SYN packet volume and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as SYN flood.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN behavior consistent with SYN flood characteristics (high SYN count, OTH flag), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
