- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.222.10:9009 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
