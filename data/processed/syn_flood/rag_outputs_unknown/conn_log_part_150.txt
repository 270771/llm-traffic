- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.95.167:10443 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets without completion.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
