- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48929 to 133.118.74.106:60023 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, zero successful handshakes).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
