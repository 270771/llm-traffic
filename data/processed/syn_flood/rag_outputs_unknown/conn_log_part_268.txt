- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.27.39:37215 shows S0 state with zero bytes transferred and only one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious, since S0 states with no established connections typically indicate SYN flood behavior.
