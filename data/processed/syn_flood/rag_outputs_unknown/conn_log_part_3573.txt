- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 targeting destination IP 203.65.117.73 on port 20185 with 1300 SYN packets and zero established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without corresponding connection completions—are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, which exhausts server resources by initiating but not completing TCP handshakes.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
