- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 (port 41969) targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs, indicating a classic SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common cybersecurity knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent service disruption. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
