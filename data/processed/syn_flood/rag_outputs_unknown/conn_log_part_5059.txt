- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.190.117 on port 82 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target.
