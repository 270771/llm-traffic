- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.164.164 on port 21270 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag set, 1 SYN sent, 0 established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
