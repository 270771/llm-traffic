- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42733 to 133.250.160.24:44303 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and the presence of SYN packets without completion, which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
