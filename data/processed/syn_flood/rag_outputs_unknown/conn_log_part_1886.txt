- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.22.183 on port 119 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
