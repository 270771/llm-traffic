- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and zero ACK responses within a short interval (3.012 seconds).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without corresponding ACKs is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further resource exhaustion on the target server and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
