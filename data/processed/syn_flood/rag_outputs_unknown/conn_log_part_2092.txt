- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:34260 to 133.118.207.157:40029 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack volume persists.
