- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.50.163:9869 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
