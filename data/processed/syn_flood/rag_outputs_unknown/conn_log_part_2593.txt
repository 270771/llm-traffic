- SYN flood alert: Source IP 39.84.96.204 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 203.65.103.15 on port 6379 with a high rate (60 SYNs in a short interval) and zero successful connections (REJ status).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without successful handshakes to a single port (commonly Redis on 6379) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 39.84.96.204 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
