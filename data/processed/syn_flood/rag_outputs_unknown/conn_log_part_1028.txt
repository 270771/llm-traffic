- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45344 to 202.44.202.121:15673 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), only 1 SYN sent, no responses, and no data transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of a single SYN with no handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated attempts. If persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
