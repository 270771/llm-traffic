- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no corresponding established connections, indicated by RSTR (reset) flags and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without connection establishment and immediate resets is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
