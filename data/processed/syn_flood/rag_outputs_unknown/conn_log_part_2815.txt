- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and zero ACK responses, indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
