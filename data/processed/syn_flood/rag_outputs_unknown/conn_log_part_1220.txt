- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.28.130 on port 789 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection counts strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system’s resources. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
