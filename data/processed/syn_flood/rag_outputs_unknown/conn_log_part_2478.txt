- SYN flood alert: High volume of TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.98 on port 9160 with 38 SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs, indicating a potential SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.98 on port 9160 and initiate investigation of the source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshakes—justifying proactive mitigation to prevent service disruption.
