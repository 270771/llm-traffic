- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59120 to 133.118.228.4:12019 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, SYN sent, no response) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
