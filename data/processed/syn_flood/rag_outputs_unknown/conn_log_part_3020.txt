- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 on high source port 51393 targeting destination 163.21.47.248 port 12424 with TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), 44 connection attempts, 0 completions, indicating many half-open connections consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristics, the connection pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) and TCP flags strongly indicate a SYN flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
