- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.96.251 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or established connections, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for repeated SYN-only connection attempts, as the S0 flag pattern is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack attempting to exhaust server resources.
