- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; no heuristic or taxonomy context available for explicit confirmation.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN flags without ACK responses on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern requiring decisive mitigation.
