- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4649 to 133.250.66.120:25002 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
