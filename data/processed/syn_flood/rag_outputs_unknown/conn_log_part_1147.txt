- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the presence of repeated SYN flags without completion of TCP handshake is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
