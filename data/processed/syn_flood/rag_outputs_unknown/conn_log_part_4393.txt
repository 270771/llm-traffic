- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.101.157 on port 1153 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this alert.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as incomplete handshakes (S0) are a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
