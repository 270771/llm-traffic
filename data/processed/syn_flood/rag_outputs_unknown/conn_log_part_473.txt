- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19330 to 133.118.19.147:4242 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
