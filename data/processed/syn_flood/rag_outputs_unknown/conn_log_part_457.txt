- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 203.65.1.253:5858 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and no completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
