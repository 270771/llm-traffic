- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and presence of RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood patterns persist, as the connection pattern is consistent with SYN flood characteristics despite lack of anomaly data.
