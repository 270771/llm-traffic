- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.93.7 on port 4443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN without response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further monitoring for additional suspicious activity from this source.
