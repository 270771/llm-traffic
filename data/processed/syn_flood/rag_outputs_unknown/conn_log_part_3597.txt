- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59986 to 133.118.66.181:12547 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as it reflects numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
