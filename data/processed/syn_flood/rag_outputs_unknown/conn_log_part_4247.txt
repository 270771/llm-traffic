- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.152.168.150 on port 12441 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful connections, resulting in REJ (reject) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity; implement rate-limiting on port 12441 to mitigate possible SYN flood impact until further data is available.
