- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2600 to 163.21.235.190:18075 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
