- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 203.65.34.245:9050 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 60 packets and 1 connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 203.65.34.245 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is available to definitively confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of a high packet count with OTH (other) TCP flag and minimal connections suggests abnormal traffic. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential SYN flood impact.
