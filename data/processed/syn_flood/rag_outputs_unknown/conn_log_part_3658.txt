- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.57.5 on port 24858 with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP connection flood patterns.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
