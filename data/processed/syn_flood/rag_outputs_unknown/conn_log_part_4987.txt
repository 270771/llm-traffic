- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54364 to 133.118.47.119:16038 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (connection attempt sent, no response) combined with multiple packets and zero established connections aligns with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation; if volume persists, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
