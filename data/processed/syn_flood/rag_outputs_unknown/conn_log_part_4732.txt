- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.250.76 on port 12197 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK, indicating a half-open connection (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the SYN flood signature (many SYNs without ACKs) is evident despite lack of formal anomaly data.
