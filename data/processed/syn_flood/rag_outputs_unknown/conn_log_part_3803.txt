- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.26.146 on port 18089 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
