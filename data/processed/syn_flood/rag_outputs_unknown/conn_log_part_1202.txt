- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.179.35 on port 8130 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with known TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
