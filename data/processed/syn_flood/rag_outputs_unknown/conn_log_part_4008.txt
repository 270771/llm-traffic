- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42271 to 163.21.17.134:18032 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—align with standard SYN flood patterns where attackers overwhelm targets by initiating connections without completing handshakes.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
