- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion and RSTR responses strongly indicates a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet).
