- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52270 to 133.118.89.120:31444 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
