- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with a SYN flood (high SYN rate, no successful connections, RSTR flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate for manual investigation due to lack of anomaly metadata but clear SYN flood indicators.
