- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.110.35 on ports 17867 → 12277 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a SYN flood attack, as the incomplete handshake pattern (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
