- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10982 to 163.21.195.140:26257 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (44 SYNs with zero completions) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN requests without corresponding ACKs, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
