- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.108.16 on port 37 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record available; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion aligns with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security heuristics.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.108.16 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
