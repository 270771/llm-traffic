- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.113.220 on port 12445 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior. Initiate investigation on source and monitor for further suspicious activity.
