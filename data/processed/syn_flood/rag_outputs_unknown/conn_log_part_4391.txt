- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.209.160:5985 shows S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with high SYN count and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
