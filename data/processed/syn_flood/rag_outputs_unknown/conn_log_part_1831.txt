- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38561 to 203.65.97.31:30123 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
