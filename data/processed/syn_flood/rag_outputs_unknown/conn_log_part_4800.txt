- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the presence of repeated SYN flags without handshake completion on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator requiring prompt blocking to protect network resources.
