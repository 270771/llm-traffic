- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38538 to 202.44.194.153:12291 showing a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or response) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
