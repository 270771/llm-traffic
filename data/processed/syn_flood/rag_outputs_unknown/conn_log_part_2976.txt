- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.50.83 on port 3306 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 3306 to mitigate impact.
