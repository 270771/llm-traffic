- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35031 to 203.65.59.18:26257 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
