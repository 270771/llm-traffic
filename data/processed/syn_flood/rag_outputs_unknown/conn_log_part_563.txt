- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40741 to 203.65.121.41:25082 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 44 bytes, no established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
