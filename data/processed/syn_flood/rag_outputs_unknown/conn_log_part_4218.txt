- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52168 to 133.118.70.155:10324 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (44 SYNs with zero completions) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practice.
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
