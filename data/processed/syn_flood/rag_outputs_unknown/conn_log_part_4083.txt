- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43896 to 133.118.167.98:18077 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
