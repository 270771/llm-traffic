- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:62949 to 133.118.13.10:21443 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without response (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target 133.118.13.10.
