- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:61003 to 163.21.237.238:12566 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no response) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target 163.21.237.238. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
