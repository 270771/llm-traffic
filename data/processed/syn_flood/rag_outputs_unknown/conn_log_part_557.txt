- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:52014 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion and RST responses is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
