- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 163.21.244.99 to 192.103.164.17 on port 636 with OTH flag and minimal packet exchange.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 163.21.244.99 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN flood behavior due to the OTH flag and minimal handshake completion, which is consistent with SYN flood characteristics. Immediate investigation and precautionary rate-limiting are warranted.
