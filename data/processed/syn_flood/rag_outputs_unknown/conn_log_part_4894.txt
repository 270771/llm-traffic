- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.169.184 on port 9869 with 252 SYN packets over 3.47 seconds, resulting in no successful connections and multiple RST responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the high volume of SYN packets with no established connections and RST responses strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
