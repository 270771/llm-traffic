- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.204.242 on port 2222 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting port 2222 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns from this IP.
