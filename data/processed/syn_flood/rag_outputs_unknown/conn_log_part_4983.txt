- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46953 to 133.118.216.186:10003 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0, only 1 SYN sent, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as single SYN with no response is a classic SYN flood indicator.
