- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26312 to 202.44.251.237:1433 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without ACKs, overwhelming the target.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server at 202.44.251.237:1433.
