- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.161.183 on port 5986 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
