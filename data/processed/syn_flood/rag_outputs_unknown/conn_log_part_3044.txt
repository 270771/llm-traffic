- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.136.16 on port 12082 showing SYN sent (S0) with no response, indicating incomplete handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) are characteristic of SYN flood attacks.
