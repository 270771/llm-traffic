- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.121.0 on port 2761 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 2761 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity due to observed incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
