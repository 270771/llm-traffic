- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2989 to 203.65.127.76:9899 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response or completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
