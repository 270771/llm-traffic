- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40255 to 163.21.198.138:17182 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm SYN flood activity, as repeated incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern.
