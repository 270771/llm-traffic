- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.23.24 on port 12584 showing S0 flag with zero bytes transferred, indicating a SYN packet without completion of handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as SYN flood behavior.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the presence of an S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) with zero bytes and a single SYN packet strongly suggests a SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
