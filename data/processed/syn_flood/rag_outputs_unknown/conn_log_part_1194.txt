- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41768 to 133.118.61.69:16046 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
