- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood behavior due to suspicious connection resets and lack of handshake completion.
