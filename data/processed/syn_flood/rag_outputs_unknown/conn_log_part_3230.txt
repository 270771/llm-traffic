- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard network security understanding.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate blocking if the flood persists to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
