- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.65.49 on port 9199 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
