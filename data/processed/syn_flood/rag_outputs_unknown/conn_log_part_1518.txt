- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.0.32 on port 16015 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
