  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate investigation on source and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
