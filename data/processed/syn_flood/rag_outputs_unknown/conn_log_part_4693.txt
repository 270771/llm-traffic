- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.232.187 on port 22705 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 SYN packets sent and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for malicious activity.
