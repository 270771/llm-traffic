- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 133.118.141.211:8443 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern (many SYNs without ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
