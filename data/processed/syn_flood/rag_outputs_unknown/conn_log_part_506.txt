- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 203.65.50.23:10443 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of multiple SYN packets without established connections (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
