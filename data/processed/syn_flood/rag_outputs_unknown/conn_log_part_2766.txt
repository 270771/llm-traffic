- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.51.24 on ports 19721 → 20256 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections confirm classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without handshake completion overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
