- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.10.5 on port 1023 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
