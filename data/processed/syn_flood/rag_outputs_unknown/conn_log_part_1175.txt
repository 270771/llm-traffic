- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 40006 targeting destination IP 202.152.173.202 on port 23 (Telnet) with rapid RSTR (reset) responses and zero successful handshakes, indicating connection refusal or reset.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts followed by immediate resets on a sensitive port (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and investigation of traffic patterns to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
