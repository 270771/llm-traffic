- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.20.212 on port 21258 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
