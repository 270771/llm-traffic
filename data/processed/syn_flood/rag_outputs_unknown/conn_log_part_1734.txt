- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51364 to 163.21.130.44:9209 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
