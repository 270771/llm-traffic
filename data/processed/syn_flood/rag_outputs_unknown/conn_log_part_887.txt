- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as repeated SYN attempts with resets on port 23 (Telnet) are consistent with reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
