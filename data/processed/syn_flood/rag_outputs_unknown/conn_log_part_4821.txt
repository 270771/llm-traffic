- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.151.174 on port 9001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response strongly indicate SYN flood behavior.
