- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.159.76 on port 10201 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
