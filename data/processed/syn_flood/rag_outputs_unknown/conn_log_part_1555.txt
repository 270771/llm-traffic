- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.152.254 on port 16404 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further network traffic investigation to identify potential attack patterns.
