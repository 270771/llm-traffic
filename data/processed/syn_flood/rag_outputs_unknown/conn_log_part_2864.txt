- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23127 to 163.21.12.170:8291 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this alert.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
