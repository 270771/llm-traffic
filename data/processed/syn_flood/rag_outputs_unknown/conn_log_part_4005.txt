- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert details a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—targeting a known service port (23, Telnet). This behavior is a confirmed threat pattern in network security. Blocking outright without further data risks false positives; therefore, rate-limiting combined with investigation is the prudent, assertive response.
