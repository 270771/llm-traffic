- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58781 to 133.118.252.152:32001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 32001 to mitigate SYN flood impact.
