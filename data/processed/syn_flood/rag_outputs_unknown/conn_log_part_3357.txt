- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.188.37 on port 19286 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK) is a classic indicator of SYN flood activity and poses a direct threat to service availability.
