- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.98 on port 9160 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior (high SYN rate, zero completions, REJ flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.98 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood activity.
