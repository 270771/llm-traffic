- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.144.26 on port 2379 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, many SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
