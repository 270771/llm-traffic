- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.72.22 on port 18082 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
