- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.38.14 on port 14896 show a high number of SYN packets (44) with zero successful connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
