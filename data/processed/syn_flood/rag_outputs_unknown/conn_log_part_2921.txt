- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39615 to 133.118.170.252:18028 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets without completion.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; consider blocking if attack persists.
