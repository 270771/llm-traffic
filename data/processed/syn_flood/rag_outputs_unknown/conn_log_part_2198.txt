- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228:53498 to 202.152.173.202:23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of repeated SYN flags without completion of TCP handshake is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 23 and investigate for further malicious activity.
