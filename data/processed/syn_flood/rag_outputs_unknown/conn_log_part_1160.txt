- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.120.248 on port 4786 shows S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating numerous SYN packets without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with high SYN attempts and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, consistent with known TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
