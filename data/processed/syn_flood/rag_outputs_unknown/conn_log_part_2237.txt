- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.225.6 on port 9303 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
