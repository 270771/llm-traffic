- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58799 to 133.118.218.3:12475 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes, overwhelming target resources.
