- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.110.203 on ports 11242 → 16068 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 packets, 1 connection attempt, zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to prevent denial of service.
