- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake completion (indicated by RSTR flags and zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic, as the observed behavior aligns with typical SYN flood attack patterns targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
