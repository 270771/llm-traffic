- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.165.104 on port 30479 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
