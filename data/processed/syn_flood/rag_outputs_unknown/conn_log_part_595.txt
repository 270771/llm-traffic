- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55727 to 202.44.248.52:42208 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completed handshakes (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
