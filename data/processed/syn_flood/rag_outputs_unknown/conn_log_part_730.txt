- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:25609 to 133.118.183.24:21237 shows SYN flood pattern with S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (multiple SYNs with no ACKs) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
