- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34418 to 133.118.248.137:49767 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no handshake completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
