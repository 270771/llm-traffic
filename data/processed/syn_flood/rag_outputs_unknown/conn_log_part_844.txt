- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39195 to 133.118.7.133:12525 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and investigate the source to prevent denial of service.
