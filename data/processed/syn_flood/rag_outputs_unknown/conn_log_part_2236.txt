- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4044 to 163.21.97.127:16094 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high packet count with minimal connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 16094 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat intelligence.
