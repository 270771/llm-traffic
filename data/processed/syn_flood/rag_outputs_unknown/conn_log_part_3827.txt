- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 55453 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets with suspicious TCP flags targeting port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood attack behavior. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if traffic persists to protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service.
