- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43273 to 133.118.82.167:21274 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
