- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.158.225 on port 2094 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag pattern (SYN sent, no response) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
