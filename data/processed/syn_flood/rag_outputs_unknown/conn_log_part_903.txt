- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 (src port 41380) to 202.152.173.202 port 23, showing flags consistent with SYN flood behavior (multiple SYNs, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly confirmation but clear SYN flood indicators.
