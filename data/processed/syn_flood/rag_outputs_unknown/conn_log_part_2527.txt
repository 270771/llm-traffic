- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.108.194 on port 16099 with SYN packets sent but no established connections (S0 state, 44 SYN packets, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding connection completions (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
