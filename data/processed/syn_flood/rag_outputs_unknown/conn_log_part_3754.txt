- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.143.14 on port 18006 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
