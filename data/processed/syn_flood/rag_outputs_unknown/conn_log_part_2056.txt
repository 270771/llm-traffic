- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.166.224 on port 10083 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, many SYNs, zero completions) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system.
