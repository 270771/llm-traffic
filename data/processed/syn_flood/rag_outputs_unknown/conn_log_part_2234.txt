- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53654 to 203.65.51.58:50113 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics (S0 state, SYN packets without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
