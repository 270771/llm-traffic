- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:14166 to 163.21.152.19:6666 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion—is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
