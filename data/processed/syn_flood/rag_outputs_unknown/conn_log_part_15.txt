- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid connection attempts and RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; consider blocking if SYN flood persists due to high risk of denial-of-service on port 23 (Telnet).
