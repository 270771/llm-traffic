- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63229 to 163.21.93.26:30700 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
