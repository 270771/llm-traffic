- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:60937 to 133.118.244.167:16103 shows S0 flag with zero bytes transferred, indicating SYN sent but no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as SYN flood due to lack of response and incomplete TCP handshake.
