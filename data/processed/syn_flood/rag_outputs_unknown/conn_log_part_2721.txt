- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25893 to 203.65.86.158:18076 with SYN packets and no completed handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent without completing the TCP handshake (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this, the behavior itself is consistent with SYN flood patterns. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
