- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.215.192 on port 515 with multiple incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as multiple SYN packets without completion strongly indicate a SYN flood attack.
