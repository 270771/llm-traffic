- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.221.213 on port 12265 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
