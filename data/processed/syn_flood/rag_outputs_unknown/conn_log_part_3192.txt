- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.0.213 on port 445 with multiple incomplete connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake (S0 state), targeting port 445 (commonly exploited SMB port).
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact on port 445.
