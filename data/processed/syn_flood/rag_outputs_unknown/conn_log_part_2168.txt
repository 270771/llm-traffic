- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.83.104 on port 10001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
