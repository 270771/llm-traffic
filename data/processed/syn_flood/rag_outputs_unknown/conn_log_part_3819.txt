- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.150.46 on port 12310 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.150.46 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (many SYNs, no ACKs).
