- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake, targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector.
  → Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate for further malicious activity.
