- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60765 to 202.44.238.1:12156 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets with no completed connections (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Without anomaly records, a cautious approach is to investigate and apply rate-limiting or blocking as needed.
