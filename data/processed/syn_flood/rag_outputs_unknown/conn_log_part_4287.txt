- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.139.254 on port 14265 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed TCP flags and connection pattern (SYN sent, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
