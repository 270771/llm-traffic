- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.64.149 on port 12121 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect service availability.
