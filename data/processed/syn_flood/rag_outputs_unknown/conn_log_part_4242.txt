- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.80.12 on port 44300 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
