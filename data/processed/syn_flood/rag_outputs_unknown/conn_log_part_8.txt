- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44344 to 163.21.111.136:50080 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN attempts and zero completions is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
