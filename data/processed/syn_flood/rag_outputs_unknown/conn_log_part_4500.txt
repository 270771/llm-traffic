- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.109.151 on port 18112 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood impact and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
