- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show abnormal behavior with zero successful handshakes and multiple reset responses (RSTR), indicating potential SYN flood activity.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood attack. Implement monitoring to detect further anomalous TCP connection patterns.
