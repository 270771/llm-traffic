- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.41.65 on port 8614 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no response, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (taxonomy: SYN flood - overwhelming target with SYN requests to exhaust resources).
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
