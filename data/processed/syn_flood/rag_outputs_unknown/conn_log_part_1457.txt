- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.136.52 on port 55555 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.136.52. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
