- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.226.77 on port 23424 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm targets by initiating connections without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
