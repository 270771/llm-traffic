- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64578 to 133.250.169.44:9387 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 connections established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without connection establishment (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
