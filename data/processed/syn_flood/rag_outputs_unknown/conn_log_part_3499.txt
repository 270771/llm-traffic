- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:6707 to 133.118.181.208:502 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
