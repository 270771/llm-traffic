- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination IP 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no corresponding successful connections, ending in RSTR (reset) flags, indicating connection refusals.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts followed by resets on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202:23 and initiate source IP investigation to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
