- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.170.140:4443 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
