- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.12.50 on port 9418 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.12.50 on port 9418 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a SYN flood attack, given the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion.
