- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:60291 to 202.152.173.202:23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service impact.
