- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.127.164 on port 32303 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
