- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.185.37 on port 1200 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.185.37 on port 1200 and initiate investigation of the source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement blocking if traffic persists or escalates.
