- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 (Telnet), showing multiple SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the presence of repeated SYN flags without ACK responses on a commonly targeted port (23) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Blocking the source IP is the necessary defensive measure.
