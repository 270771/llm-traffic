- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, repeated attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and apply rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristics, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets with suspicious flags to a known service port (23, Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood attack behavior and warrants proactive mitigation.
