- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.67.241 on port 2083 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of multiple incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) on a sensitive port (2083, often used for secure web admin interfaces) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
