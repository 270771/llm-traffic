- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show a high rate of SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by RSTR flags and zero ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and apply rate-limiting on incoming connections from this IP to port 23 to mitigate possible denial-of-service impact.
