- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:24456 to 133.118.226.114:62865 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero established connections) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system.
