- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without connection establishment and multiple reset flags strongly aligns with SYN flood attack behavior. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
