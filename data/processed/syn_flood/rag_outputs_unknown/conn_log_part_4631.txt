- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:12354 to 202.44.201.255:12452 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern align with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system.
