- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid RSTR responses and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows repeated TCP connection attempts with RSTR (reset) flags and no successful connections, which is consistent with SYN flood behavior aiming to exhaust target resources. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
