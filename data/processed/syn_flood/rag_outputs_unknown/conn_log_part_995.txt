- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.21.67 on port 62078 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating connection attempts without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
