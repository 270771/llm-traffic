- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.131 on port 9100 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
