- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:7682 to 133.250.163.223:19233 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent. If confirmed, block the IP to prevent further disruption.
