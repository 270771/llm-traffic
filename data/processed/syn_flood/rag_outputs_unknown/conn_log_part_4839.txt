- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.153.20:7777 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.153.20:7777 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP.
