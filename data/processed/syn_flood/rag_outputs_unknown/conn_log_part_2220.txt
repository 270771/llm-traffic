- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 203.65.71.84:7071 shows S0 flag with 1 SYN packet sent and no response, indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with zero established connections and only SYN packets sent is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
