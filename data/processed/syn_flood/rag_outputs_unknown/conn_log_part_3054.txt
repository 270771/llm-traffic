- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.163.182 on port 52010 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
