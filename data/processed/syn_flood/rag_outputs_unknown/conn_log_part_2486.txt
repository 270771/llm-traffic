- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.12.51 on port 36501 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (S0 flag set), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
