- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.20.4 on port 81 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security heuristics.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.20.4 and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
