- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.69.144 on port 33060 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
