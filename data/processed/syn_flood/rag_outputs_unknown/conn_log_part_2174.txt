- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26312 to 133.118.111.181:1433 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) to a common database port (1433) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
