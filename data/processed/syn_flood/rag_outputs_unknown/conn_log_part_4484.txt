- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns are detected, as the rapid SYN attempts with no handshake completion and reset responses are consistent with SYN flood behavior.
