- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.87.250 on port 12500 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
