- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.81.116 on port 8112 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.81.116 on port 8112 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
