- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 163.21.72.107 on high source port 23592 targeting destination IP 192.103.164.17 on port 636, with TCP flag OTH (no SYN, FIN, RST, or ACK flags set), and a high count of 60 attempts within the observed interval.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous connection attempts with unusual TCP flags (OTH) and high frequency strongly indicates a SYN flood or related TCP-based DoS attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 163.21.72.107 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target service on port 636.
