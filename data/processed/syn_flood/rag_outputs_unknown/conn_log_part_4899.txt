- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48934 to 203.65.84.125:18100 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) indicate potential SYN flood behavior.
