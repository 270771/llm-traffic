- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.146.15 on port 16065 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
