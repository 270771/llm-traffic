- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.221.202 on port 12275 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
