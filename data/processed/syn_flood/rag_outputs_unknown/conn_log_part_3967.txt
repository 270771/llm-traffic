- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.119.191 on port 3260 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 3260 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
