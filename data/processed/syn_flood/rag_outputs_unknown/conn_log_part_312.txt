- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.225.240 on port 12167 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
