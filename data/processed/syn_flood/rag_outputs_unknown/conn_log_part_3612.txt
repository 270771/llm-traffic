- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35769 to 203.65.82.231:30009 showing S0 flag with 1 attempt and 44 bytes transferred, indicating a SYN packet sent without completion of handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of S0 flag with no handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious connection attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.
