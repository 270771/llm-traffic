- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 8.117.138.14 to 163.21.148.140 on port 2375 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from IP 8.117.138.14 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
