- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending multiple TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with a high rate (3.75 packets/sec) and no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections typical of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s characteristics (high SYN rate, no ACKs, targeting port 23) align with standard SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
