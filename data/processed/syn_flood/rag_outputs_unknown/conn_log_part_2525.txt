- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56361 to 163.21.182.171:12561 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack volume persists.
