- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.107.29 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
