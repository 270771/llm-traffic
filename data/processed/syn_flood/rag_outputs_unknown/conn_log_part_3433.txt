- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58482 to 163.21.113.52:60443 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response or completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
