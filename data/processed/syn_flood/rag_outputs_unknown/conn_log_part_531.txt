- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.92.220:8800 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the SYN flood pattern (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a known indicator of SYN flood attacks and warrants proactive investigation and mitigation.
