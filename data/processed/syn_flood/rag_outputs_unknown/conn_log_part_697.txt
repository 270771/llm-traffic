- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.125.144 on port 51000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
