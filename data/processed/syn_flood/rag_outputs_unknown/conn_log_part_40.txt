- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR flags and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
