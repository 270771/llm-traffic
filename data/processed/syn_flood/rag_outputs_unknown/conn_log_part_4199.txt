- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 42099 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 shows rapid TCP connection attempts with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) flags within a short interval (0.311 seconds).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of rapid connection attempts with resets and no handshake completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the source IP to protect port 23 services.
