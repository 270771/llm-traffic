- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:9824 to 133.118.203.203:16002 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
