- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53455 to 202.44.243.224:9194 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
