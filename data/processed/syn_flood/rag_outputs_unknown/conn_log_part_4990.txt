- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.30.206 on port 16073 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
