- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:9711 to 133.118.49.58:12133 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
