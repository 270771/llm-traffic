- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.104.43 on port 4500 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately and implement rate-limiting on port 4500 to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
