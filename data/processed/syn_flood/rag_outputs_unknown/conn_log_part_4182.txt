- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of repeated SYN flags without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
