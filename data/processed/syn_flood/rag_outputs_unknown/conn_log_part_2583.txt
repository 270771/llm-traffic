- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 initiated numerous TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F flags, zero ACKs, and multiple retransmissions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed TCP flag pattern and connection attempts are consistent with SYN flood characteristics. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
