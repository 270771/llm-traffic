- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:19057 to 163.21.144.111:9990 showing multiple SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag indicates SYN packets sent without any response or handshake completion, a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
