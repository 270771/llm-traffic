- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and initiate investigation of source behavior due to typical SYN flood characteristics (high SYN count, no ACK response). Implement temporary block if attack persists.
