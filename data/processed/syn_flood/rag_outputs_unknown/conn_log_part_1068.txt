- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP flags indicating RSTR and short response time.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and monitor traffic to port 23; apply rate-limiting if suspicious behavior persists.

**Explanation:** Without anomaly data or heuristic context, the alert alone does not conclusively indicate a SYN flood attack. The presence of RSTR (Reset) flags and zero SYN counts suggests this may not be a classic SYN flood pattern. Therefore, proactive investigation and monitoring are warranted before blocking or other aggressive actions.
