- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.81.232 on port 12354 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and monitor for escalation. Investigate source IP for malicious activity given the classic SYN flood signature despite lack of anomaly data.
