- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 163.21.97.46 on port 49443, showing multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
