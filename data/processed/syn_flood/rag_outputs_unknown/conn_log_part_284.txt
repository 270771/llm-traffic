- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.8.145 on port 18045 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
