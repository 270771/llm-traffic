- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:53498 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR response and abnormal metrics (e.g., 0.468425 score, multiple flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection patterns to port 23; consider rate-limiting or blocking if repeated SYN flood behavior is detected.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to definitively confirm this as a SYN flood, the alert shows a TCP connection attempt to port 23 (commonly Telnet) with an RSTR (reset) response and abnormal metrics, which are typical indicators of SYN flood attempts. Without anomaly records or heuristics, a cautious approach is to investigate and monitor, escalating to blocking if the behavior persists.
