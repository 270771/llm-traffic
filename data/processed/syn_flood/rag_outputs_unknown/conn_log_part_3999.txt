- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.0.111 on port 18018 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 state, many SYNs, zero completions) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
