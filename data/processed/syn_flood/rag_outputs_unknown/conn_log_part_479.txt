- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 (Telnet), showing multiple SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator targeting port 23, a commonly exploited service.
