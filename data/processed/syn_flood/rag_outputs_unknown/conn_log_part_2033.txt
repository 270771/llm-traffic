- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.211.247 on port 12381 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
