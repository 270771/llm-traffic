- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.14.226 on port 31210 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, and initiate investigation on source behavior due to clear SYN flood characteristics (high SYN count with no handshake completion).
