- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination 163.21.211.200 on port 49, characterized by numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate to block IP if attack persists, as SYN floods disrupt service availability by exhausting server connection queues.
