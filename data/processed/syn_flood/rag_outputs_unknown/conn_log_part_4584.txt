- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and initiate investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (high SYN count, no ACKs) targeting a known service port (23 - Telnet), which is a common attack vector.
