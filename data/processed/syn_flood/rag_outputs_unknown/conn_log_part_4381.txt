- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 163.21.174.179 on port 3001, characterized by a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without connection establishment (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
