- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:12126 to 133.118.217.188:10009 showing S0 flag with 1 connection attempt and 44 packets, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag (connection attempt with no response) and high packet count with zero established connections strongly align with known SYN flood patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
