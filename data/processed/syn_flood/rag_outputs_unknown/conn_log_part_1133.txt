- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 133.118.178.131 to 192.103.164.17 on port 636 show characteristics consistent with a SYN flood (high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, short duration, and OTH state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 133.118.178.131 for potential malicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to port 636 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
