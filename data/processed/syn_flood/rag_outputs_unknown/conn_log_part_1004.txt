- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14032 to 133.250.78.156:32080 with SYN flag set, no response, and only 1 SYN packet observed (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as single SYN with no response (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attempts.
