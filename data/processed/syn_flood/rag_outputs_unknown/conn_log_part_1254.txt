- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:41999 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing high SYN rate with no successful handshake (indicated by RSTR flag and zero established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without completion and RSTR (reset) responses is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target port 23 (Telnet) with connection requests.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service impact.
