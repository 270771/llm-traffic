- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.105.226 on port 35000 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
