- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.76.176 on port 55553 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for repeated connection attempts; consider blocking if attack volume persists.
