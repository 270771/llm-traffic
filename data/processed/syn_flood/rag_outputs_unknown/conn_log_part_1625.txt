- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.202.188 on port 12298 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as single SYN without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
