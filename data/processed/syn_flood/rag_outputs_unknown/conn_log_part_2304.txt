- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.13.119 on port 82 with SYN packets sent but no completion (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
