- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.59.148 on port 4840 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common TCP state taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
