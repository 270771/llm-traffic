- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60373 to 133.118.178.85:50080 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
