- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.94.110 on port 4664 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
