- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39657 to 163.21.97.177:12263 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly or heuristic data is available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no response (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
