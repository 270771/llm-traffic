- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.233.46 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S, count 1, state S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and monitor for increased SYN rate; implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from this IP to prevent potential SYN flood escalation.
