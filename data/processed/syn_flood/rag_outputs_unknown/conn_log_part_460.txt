- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 56238 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion). Given the nature of SYN floods—overwhelming target resources by half-open TCP connections—rate-limiting and investigation are necessary to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
