- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:42426 to 202.152.173.202:23 with rapid RSTR response and high SYN rate (0.592831).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, confirmation is limited. However, the high SYN rate and RSTR response pattern strongly indicate SYN flood activity targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
