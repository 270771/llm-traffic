- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.138.54 on port 2323 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows a classic SYN flood symptom (S0 state with SYN flag and no completion). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by leaving connections half-open. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
