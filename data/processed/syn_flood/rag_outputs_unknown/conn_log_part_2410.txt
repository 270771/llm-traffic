- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65479 to 202.44.198.146:12362 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACK or SYN-ACK responses (S0 state). Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics: many half-open connections exhausting server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
