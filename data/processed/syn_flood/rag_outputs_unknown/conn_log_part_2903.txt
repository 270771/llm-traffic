- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.58.52 on port 1604 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (numerous SYN packets without established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
