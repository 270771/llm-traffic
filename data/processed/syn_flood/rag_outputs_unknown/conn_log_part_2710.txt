- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and block the IP if the behavior persists to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
