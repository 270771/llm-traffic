- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51696 to 203.65.56.163:9441 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating many half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect server availability.
