- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.89.227 on port 2762 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
