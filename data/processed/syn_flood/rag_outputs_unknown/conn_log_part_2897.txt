- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.253.84 on port 7657 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
