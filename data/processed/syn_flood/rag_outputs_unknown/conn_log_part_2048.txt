- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31802 to 202.44.211.206:993 with SYN flag set and no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
