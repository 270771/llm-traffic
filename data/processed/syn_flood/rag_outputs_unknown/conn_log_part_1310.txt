- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.169.220:7547 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
