- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.94.92 on port 9918 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
