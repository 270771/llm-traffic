- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, repeated SYNs, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood attack, as the observed packet pattern strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics despite lack of anomaly record.
