- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14909 to 133.118.219.189:46862 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
