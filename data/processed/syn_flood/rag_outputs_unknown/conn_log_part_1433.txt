- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.151.112 on port 12205 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the connection state (S0) and packet pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
