- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.245.129 on port 14523 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
