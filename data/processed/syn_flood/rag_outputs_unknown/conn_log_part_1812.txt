- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.197.147 on port 30021 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately and monitor for further SYN flood activity, as the S0 flag and repeated SYNs without handshake completion are definitive indicators of a SYN flood attack.
