- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:61483 to 133.250.189.111:44500 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (S0 state with 44 attempts and zero completions).
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server on port 44500.
