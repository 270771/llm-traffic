- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.160.19 on port 5801 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the observed SYN-only packets with no handshake completion are consistent with SYN flood behavior and warrant proactive mitigation.
