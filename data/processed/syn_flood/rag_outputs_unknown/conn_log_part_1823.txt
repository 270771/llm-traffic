- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.97.186 on port 9999 with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s characteristics (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior known to exhaust server resources by half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
