- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:32335 to 163.21.172.158:264 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
