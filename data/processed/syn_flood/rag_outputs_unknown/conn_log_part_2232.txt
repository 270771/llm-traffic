- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.1.185 on port 9350 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server at 203.65.1.185. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
