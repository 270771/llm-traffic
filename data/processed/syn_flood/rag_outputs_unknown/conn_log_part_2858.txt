- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:31211 to 163.21.52.37:17780 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
