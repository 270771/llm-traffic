- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.240.235 on port 8081 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
