- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.209.49:8069 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
