- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.223.62 on port 14265 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic and confirmed indicator of a SYN flood attack.
