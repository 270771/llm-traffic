- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38093 to 133.118.203.150:12141 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly or heuristic data is available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of SYN packets without corresponding connection completions (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
