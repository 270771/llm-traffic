- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49023 to 163.21.210.37:12175 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP SYN packet (S0 state) with no corresponding SYN-ACK or connection completion, which is characteristic of SYN flood behavior. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Given the nature of SYN floods, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
