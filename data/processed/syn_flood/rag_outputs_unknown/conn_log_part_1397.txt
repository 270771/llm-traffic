- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:48770 to 163.21.202.181:55555 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs or connection completions.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
