- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.162.91 on port 16012 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.162.91. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
