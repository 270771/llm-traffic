- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:44798 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal RSTR flags and timing consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert cannot be fully confirmed as a SYN flood attack but the behavior is suspicious enough to warrant immediate investigation and precautionary measures.
