- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.29.213 on port 3001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (flag S0, count 1).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.29.213 on port 3001 and monitor for escalation, as the SYN-only packets with no handshake completion are consistent with SYN flood behavior.
