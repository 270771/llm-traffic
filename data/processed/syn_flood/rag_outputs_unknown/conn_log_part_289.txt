- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.177.230 on port 12270 show a pattern of SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S with no ACK), indicating a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed behavior (SYN packets sent without response) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
