- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending multiple TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 within a short time frame, with flags indicating SYN and handshake failure (SH), and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without successful connections on a sensitive port (23 - Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
