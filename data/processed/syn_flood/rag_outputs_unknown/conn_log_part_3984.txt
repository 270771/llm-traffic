- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.40.10 on port 1234 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) and zero established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
