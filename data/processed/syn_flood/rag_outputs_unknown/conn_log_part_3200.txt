- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:24176 to 133.118.197.34:12527 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent. If confirmed, block the IP to prevent further disruption.
