- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.46.115 on port 4506 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
