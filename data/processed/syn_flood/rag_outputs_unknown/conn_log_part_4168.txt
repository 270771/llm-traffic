- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23127 to 163.21.149.85:8291 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 attempts, 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
