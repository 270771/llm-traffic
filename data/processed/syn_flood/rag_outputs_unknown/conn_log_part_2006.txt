- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs on a sensitive port (23, typically Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity.
