- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32557 to 133.118.155.44:12497 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect target 133.118.155.44 from resource exhaustion.
