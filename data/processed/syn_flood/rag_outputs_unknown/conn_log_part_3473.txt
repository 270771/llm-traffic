- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.45.249 on port 7001 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator; immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation or block if attack persists.
