- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:11747 to 163.21.87.119:179 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 163.21.87.119 port 179. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
