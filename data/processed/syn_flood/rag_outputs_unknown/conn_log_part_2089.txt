- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.217.188:49152 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If SYN flood persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
