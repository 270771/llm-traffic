- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:11187 to 203.65.70.99:41800 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
