- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:47666 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and short duration (0.585601s), indicating rapid connection resets.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic to port 23 (Telnet), as rapid RSTR responses and short connection durations are consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior targeting vulnerable services. Implement rate-limiting on incoming connections to port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
