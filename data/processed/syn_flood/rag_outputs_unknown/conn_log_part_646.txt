- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65452 to 163.21.75.109:10038 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
