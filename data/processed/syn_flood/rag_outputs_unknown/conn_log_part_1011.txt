- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:9799 to 133.250.147.41:25004 shows S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent, indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with zero established connections and presence of SYN packets without ACKs is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
