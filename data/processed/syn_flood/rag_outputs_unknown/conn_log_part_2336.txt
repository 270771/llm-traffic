- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.75.252 on port 6667 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent (S0 state) without completing the handshake, which is a classic sign of a SYN flood attempt. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the behavior itself—numerous SYN packets without ACKs—aligns with known SYN flood patterns. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
