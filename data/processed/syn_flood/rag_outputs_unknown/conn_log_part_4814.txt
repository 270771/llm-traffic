- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:58957 to 202.152.173.202:23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including a high rate of SYN packets and no successful connection establishment (indicated by RSTR flags and zero completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target on port 23 (Telnet), a commonly exploited service.
