- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63310 to 202.44.231.10:9990 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
