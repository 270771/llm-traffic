- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28663 to 163.21.3.146:21002 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual SYN packet patterns and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further analysis.

**Explanation:**  
The alert indicates a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake (S0 state), which is a classic sign of a SYN flood attempt. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate blocking is premature, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting will mitigate potential impact while gathering more data.
