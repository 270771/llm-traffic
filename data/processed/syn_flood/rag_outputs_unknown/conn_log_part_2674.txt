- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45700 to 133.250.150.75:20001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, no established connections, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
