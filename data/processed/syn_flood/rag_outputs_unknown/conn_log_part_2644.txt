- SYN flood alert: High-volume TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.123.14 on port 15000, with 15,000 connection attempts and zero completions (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics—extremely high SYN count with no handshake completions—are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
