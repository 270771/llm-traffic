- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31093 to 133.250.83.101:9246 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0 state, zero established connections, multiple SYN packets) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
