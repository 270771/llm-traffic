- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:22267 to 202.44.232.71:12455 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior alone are definitive indicators of SYN flood activity.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on the source for potential malicious intent.
