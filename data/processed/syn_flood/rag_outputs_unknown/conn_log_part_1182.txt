- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.175.134 on port 5432 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 5432. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
