- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show abnormal behavior with a high number of SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, ending in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no established connections and RST responses strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt targeting port 23 (Telnet). Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if behavior persists to protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service impact.
