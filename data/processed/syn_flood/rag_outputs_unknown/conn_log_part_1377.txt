- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.90.92 on ports 32680 → 21270 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
