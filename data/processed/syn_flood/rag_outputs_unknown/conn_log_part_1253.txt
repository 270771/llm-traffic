- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18539 to 133.250.99.168:102 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag, multiple SYNs without completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.99.168. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
