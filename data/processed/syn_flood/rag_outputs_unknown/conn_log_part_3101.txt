- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37203 to 133.250.145.31:9203 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood heuristics indicating resource exhaustion attempts.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect target server 133.250.145.31. Initiate monitoring for additional suspicious traffic from this source.
