- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29510 to 133.118.227.100:21321 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature despite lack of anomaly record.
