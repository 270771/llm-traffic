- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.141.55 on port 9488 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
