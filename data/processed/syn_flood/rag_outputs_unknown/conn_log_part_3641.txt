- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 202.44.250.232:47243 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and 60 bytes transferred, indicating an incomplete handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of OTH (other) TCP state with a single SYN and no completion strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns, where attackers send SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 202.44.250.232 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
