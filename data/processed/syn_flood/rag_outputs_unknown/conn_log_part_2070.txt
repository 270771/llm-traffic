- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43816 to 163.21.9.166:57780 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 57780 to mitigate impact.
