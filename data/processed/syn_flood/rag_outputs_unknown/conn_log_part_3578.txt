- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.195.209 on ports 7429 → 12157 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
