- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with a very short inter-arrival time (2.96 ms) and no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation of the source IP for potential SYN flood activity, as the rapid SYN packets without completion are consistent with SYN flood attack behavior.
