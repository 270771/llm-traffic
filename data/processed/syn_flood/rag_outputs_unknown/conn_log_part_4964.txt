- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.161.49 on port 12088 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding handshake completion (S0 flag), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag indicates a SYN sent with no response or handshake completion, a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
