- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 133.118.61.159 on ports 59126 → 12294, with TCP flag S0 indicating SYN packets without completion of handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
