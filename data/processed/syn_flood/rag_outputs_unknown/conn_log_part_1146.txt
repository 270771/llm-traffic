- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.98.157 on port 3389 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood behavior indicated by repeated SYN packets without handshake completion, targeting RDP port 3389, which is a common attack vector.
