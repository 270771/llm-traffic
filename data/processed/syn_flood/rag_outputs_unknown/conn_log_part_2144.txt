- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.240.95 on port 18888 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), which exhausts server resources and disrupts legitimate traffic.
