- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.178.68 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect network availability.
