- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.41.138 on port 9711 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further classify or explain the behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed pattern of SYN packets without response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for potential blocking if malicious intent is confirmed.
