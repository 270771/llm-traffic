- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.191.171 on port 9092 show SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
