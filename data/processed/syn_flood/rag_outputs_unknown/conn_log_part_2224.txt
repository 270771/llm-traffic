- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:15433 to 163.21.223.110:445 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the S0 flag indicates a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior targeting port 445 (commonly SMB). Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target host and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
