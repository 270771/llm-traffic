- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:36930 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and zero payload, indicating abnormal TCP handshake behavior consistent with SYN flood characteristics.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for repeated connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood pattern persists, as the RSTR response and zero payload suggest abnormal TCP session behavior typical of SYN flood attacks.
