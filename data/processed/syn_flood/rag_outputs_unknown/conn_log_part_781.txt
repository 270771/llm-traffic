- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.75.170 on port 9998 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.75.170. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
