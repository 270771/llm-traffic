- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61148 to 133.250.147.182:21320 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous SYNs without ACKs.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
