- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:58679 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN attempts without completing handshakes, triggering RSTR responses. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
