- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54737 to 133.118.24.43:9600 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without established connections (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
