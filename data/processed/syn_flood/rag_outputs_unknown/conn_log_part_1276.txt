- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29876 to 133.250.75.126:12116 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly or heuristic data is available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of multiple SYN packets without any handshake completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood pattern. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
