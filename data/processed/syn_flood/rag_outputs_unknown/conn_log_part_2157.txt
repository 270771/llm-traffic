- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 54010 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating RSTR (Reset-Received) and a short duration (0.515863 seconds), no anomalies recorded.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured anomaly data or heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns to port 23; consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood or scanning emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP connection attempt with a reset flag rather than SYN flags, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to confirm a SYN flood. Without corroborating anomaly data or heuristic definitions, this event alone does not conclusively indicate a SYN flood attack. However, the targeting of port 23 (commonly Telnet) from a high source port and a reset response suggests suspicious activity that warrants investigation and potential mitigation.
