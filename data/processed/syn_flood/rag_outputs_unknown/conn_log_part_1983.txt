- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.51.228 on port 30122 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, SYN sent only).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to classic SYN flood signature (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target.
