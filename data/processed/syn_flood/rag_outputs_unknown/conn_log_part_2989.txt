- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting destination 202.152.168.19 on port 7443 with 39 SYN packets over ~4.8 seconds, resulting in 0 established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets without successful connections and multiple resets is characteristic of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
