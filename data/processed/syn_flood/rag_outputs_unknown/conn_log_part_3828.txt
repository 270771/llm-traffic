- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no established connections, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection patterns; consider rate-limiting or temporarily blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the rapid SYN attempts with no successful handshakes and reset responses are consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
