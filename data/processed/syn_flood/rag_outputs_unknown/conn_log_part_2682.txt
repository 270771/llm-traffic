- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.139.43 on port 5432 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count without established connections is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
