- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 203.65.87.43:10417 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with zero packets and one byte, indicating incomplete handshake typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 203.65.87.43 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes; implement rate-limiting on port 636 to mitigate potential SYN flood.
