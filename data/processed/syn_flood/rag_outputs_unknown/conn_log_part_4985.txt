- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.29 on port 8139 with 517 SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs, indicating a potential SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this behavior explicitly.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for abnormal connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the high volume of SYN packets without completion is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
