- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:27327 to 133.250.155.250:18002 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
