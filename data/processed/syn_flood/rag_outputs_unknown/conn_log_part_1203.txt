- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41861 to 163.21.217.4:18103 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero established connections strongly align with known SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
