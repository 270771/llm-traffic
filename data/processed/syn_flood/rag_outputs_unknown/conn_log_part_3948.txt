- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:46906 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN attempts without successful handshakes and multiple resets. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
