- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.202.115 on port 12388 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and implement rate-limiting or block if confirmed as malicious to prevent resource exhaustion.
