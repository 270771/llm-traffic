- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.103.31 on port 7071 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior known to exhaust server resources by leaving connections half-open.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect server availability.
