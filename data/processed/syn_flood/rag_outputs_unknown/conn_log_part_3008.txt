- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43372 to 163.21.134.110:12478 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP state analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
