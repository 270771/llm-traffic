- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.143.118 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 0 established) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood attack. Initiate further monitoring for related suspicious activity.
