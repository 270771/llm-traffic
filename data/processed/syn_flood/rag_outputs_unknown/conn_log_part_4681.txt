- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.162.93 on port 7309 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero successful connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
