- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.219.23 on port 9000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 flag, multiple SYNs without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
