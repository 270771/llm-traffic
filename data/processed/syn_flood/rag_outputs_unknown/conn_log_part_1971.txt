- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106:8108 to 163.21.248.48:9999 with multiple SYN attempts and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (multiple SYNs without handshake completion).
