- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.56.110 on port 18049 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics (SYN packets sent, no handshake completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
