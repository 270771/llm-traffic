- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.128.130 on port 64671 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
