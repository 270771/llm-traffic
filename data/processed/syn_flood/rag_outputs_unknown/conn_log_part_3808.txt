- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.159.208 on port 12213 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior due to clear signs of incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood attacks.
