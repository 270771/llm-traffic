- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.98.142 on port 10554 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
