- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39156 to 163.21.59.180:12468 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly correspond to classic SYN flood behavior, where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
