- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.72.152 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and high packet count without established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
