- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:56903 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and very low response time (0.394s), zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection attempts to port 23 (Telnet), as repeated RSTR responses and zero successful connections indicate potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity. Consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.
