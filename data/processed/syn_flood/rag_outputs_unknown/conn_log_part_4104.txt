- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with repeated SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as repeated SYN attempts without handshake completion and RSTR responses indicate potential SYN flood attack patterns.
