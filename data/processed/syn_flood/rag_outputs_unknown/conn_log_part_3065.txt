- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.60.76:9000 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
