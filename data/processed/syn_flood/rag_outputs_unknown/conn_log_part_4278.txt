- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 157.161.40.85:5038 to 178.247.21.1:49030 showing OTH flag with reset and only 1 packet sent, consistent with incomplete TCP handshake behavior typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the connection pattern (single packet, OTH flag, reset) aligns with known SYN flood characteristics where half-open connections exhaust resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block traffic from source IP 157.161.40.85 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
