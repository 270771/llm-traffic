- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49890 to 133.118.9.145:46001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN sent with no response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
