- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19330 to 133.118.61.172:104 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
