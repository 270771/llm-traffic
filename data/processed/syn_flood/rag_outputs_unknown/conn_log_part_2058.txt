- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:19079 to 133.118.117.85:23082 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and packet counts strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs).  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
