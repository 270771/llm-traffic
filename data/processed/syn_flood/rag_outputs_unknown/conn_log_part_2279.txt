- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13194 to 202.44.202.185:21264 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response or completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
