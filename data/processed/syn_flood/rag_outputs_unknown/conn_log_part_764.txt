- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.167.103 on port 12324 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect server availability. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
