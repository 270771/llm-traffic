- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.55.233 on port 12352 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 flags, many SYNs, zero completions) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 203.65.55.233. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
