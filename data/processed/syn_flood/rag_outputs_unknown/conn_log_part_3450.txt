- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.113.146 on port 28003 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero ACKs) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
