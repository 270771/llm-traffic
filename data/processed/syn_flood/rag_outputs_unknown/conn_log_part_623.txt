- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.219.216 on port 1099 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
