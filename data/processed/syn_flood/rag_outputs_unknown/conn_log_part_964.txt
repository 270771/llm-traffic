- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40973 to 203.65.8.219:12150 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN flag and zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
