- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41476 to 202.44.226.238:12415 with SYN flag set, resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 state with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
