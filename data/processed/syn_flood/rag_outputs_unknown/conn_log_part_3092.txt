- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.250.159.198:2067 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN packet sent without completion of the TCP handshake (S0 state), which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
