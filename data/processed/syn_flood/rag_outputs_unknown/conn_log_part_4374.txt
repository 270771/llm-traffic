- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.217.155:2082 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response strongly align with known SYN flood behavior patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
