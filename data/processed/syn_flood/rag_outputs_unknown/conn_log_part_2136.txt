- SYN flood alert: High-rate TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 202.152.168.90 on port 10000, with rapid connection attempts and zero successful completions, resulting in connection rejections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets with no handshake completion and connection rejections is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior from this or related IPs.
