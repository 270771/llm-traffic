- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) responses within a short interval (0.348880 seconds).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of rapid SYNs with no established connections and immediate resets is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting port 23 (Telnet). Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 and blocking if the behavior persists to prevent resource exhaustion.
