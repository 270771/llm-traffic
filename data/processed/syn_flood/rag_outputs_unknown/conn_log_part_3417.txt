- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed behavior—high-rate SYN packets with no handshake completion and RSTR responses—is consistent with SYN flood attack patterns targeting port 23 (Telnet). Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
