- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.130.30 on port 12356 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
