- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35955 to 133.118.145.188:12124 with SYN flag set, resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 states typically indicate incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
