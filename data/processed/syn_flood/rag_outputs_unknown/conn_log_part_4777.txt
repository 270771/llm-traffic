- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) responses, indicating connection refusal.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no established connections and reset responses is a classic SYN flood signature targeting port 23 (Telnet). Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
