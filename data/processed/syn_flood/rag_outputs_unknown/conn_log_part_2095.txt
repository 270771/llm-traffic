- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.67.129 on ports 11187 → 11000 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known and definitive indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
