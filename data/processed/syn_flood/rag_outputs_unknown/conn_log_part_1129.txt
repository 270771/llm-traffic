- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 163.21.64.150 to 13.111.136.41 on port 443 with high packet count and connection attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 163.21.64.150 immediately and apply rate-limiting or block if SYN flood behavior persists, as the high volume of SYN packets and failed connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack.
