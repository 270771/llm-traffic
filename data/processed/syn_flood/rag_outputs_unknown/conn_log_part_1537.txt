- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:22369 to 163.21.215.183:6379 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) to port 6379 (commonly Redis) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further.
