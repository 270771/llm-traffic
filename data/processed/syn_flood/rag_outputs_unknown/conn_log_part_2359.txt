- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.39.100:10243 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous SYN packets without handshake completion.
