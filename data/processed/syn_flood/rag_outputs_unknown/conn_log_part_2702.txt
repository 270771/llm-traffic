- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27289 to 133.250.90.175:21306 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag, multiple SYNs without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
