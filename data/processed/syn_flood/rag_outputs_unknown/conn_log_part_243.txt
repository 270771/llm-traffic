- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN packets with suspicious flags targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
