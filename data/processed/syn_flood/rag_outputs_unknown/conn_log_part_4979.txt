- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.69.64 on port 13 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
