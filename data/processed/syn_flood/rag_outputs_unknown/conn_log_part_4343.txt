- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.36.22 on port 2121 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s SYN-only connection attempts with zero completions align with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 2121 and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
