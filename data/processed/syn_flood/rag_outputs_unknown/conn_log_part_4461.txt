- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and zero ACK responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, targeting port 23 (Telnet), a commonly exploited service. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aiming to exhaust server resources. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
