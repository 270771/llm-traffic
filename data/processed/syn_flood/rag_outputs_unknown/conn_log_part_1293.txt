- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.161.80 on ports 22284→29984 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
