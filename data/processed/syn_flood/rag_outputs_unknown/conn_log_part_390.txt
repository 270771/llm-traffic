- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:6707 to 133.250.94.12:502 with SYN packets resulting in no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the S0 flag and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.94.12 port 502. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
