- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23565 to 163.21.229.223:14875 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target 163.21.229.223 from denial-of-service impact.
