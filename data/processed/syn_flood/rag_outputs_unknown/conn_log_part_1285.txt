- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and multiple RSTR (reset) responses within a short interval (0.105787 seconds).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the rapid SYN attempts with no successful handshakes and immediate resets strongly indicate a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet). Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if the behavior persists to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
