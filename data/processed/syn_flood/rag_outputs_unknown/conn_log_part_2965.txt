- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and presence of RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion on port 23 (Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for malicious intent.
