- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.79.68 on port 21291 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect server availability.
