- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for further malicious activity.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior—numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes—targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), which is a known attack vector. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
