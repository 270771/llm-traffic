- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.145.153 on port 12144 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate further monitoring for additional suspicious activity from this IP.
