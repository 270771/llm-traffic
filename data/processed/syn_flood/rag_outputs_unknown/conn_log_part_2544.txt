- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26260 to 133.118.81.188:27015 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the SYN flood signature (many SYNs without completion) is evident despite lack of anomaly data.
