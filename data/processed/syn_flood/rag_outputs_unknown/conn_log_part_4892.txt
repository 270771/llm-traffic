- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.172.12:10443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
