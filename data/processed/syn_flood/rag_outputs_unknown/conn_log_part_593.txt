- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33183 to 133.250.100.90:26257 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
