- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3807 to 133.118.39.189:10023 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
