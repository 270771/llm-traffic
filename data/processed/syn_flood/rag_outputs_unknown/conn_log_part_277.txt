- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.235.84 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
