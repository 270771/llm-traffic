- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.47.146 on port 1025 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
