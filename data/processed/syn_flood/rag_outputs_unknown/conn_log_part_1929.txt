- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:26304 to 133.118.83.60:18081 show SYN packets with no completion of handshake (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
