- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.250.107.140:21025 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (SYN sent, no ACK), which is a classic denial-of-service signature. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
