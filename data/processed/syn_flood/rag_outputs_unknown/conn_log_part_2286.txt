- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51160 to 163.21.180.4:12330 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple failed attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completed handshakes (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
