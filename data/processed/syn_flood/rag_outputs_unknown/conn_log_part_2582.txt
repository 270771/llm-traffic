- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.89.131 on port 30025 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system.
