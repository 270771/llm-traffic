- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard network security understanding.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and block the IP if the flood persists to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
