- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 54010 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating SYN and high packet rate (2.546782 seconds interval, 3 packets).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets to port 23 (commonly targeted for exploitation) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for escalation. If attack persists, block IP to protect Telnet service.
