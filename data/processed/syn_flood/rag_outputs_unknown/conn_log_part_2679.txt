- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.68.144 on port 9273 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed S0 flag pattern (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
