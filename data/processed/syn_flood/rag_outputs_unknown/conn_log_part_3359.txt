- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 47.41.151.4 to 163.21.148.140 on port 23 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and 12 SYN packets sent within a short interval.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 47.41.151.4 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If confirmed persistent, block the IP to protect the target on port 23.
