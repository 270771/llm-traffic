- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35932 to 163.21.152.178:21303 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, F) and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target host. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
