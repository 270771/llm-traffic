- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 initiated a TCP connection flood against destination 163.21.96.82 on port 5222, with numerous SYN packets sent without completing handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (high volume of incomplete TCP handshakes) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the attack and investigate further network logs for corroboration.
