- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.205.215 on port 12247 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 12247 to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
