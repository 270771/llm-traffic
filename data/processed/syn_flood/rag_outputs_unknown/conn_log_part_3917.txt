- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high source port 63929 targeting destination 8.34.37.255 port 80 with 490 SYN packets and zero ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the volume of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 157.161.40.85 to protect the destination server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
