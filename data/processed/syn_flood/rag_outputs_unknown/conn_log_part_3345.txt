- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, followed by RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion and RSTR responses is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
