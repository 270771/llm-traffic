- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as repeated SYN attempts with resets indicate a likely SYN flood attempt despite lack of anomaly data.
