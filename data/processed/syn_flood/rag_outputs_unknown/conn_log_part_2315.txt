- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.227.216:49153 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
