- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.169.88 on port 1200 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP SYN flood heuristics (excessive half-open connections causing resource exhaustion).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
