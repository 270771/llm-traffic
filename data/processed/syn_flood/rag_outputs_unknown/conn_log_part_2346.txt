- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.168.141 on port 30015 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed S0 flag pattern (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
