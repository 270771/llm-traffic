- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.63.33:8000 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags (S0) and connection attempts without completion.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
