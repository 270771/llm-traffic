- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.78.54 on port 12251 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the SYN-only connection attempts without completion are indicative of a SYN flood attack.
