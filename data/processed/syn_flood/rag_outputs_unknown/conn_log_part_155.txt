- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11444 to 203.65.86.76:11701 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
