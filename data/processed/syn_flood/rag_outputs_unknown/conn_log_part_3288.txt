- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.212.27 on ports 20316 → 15502 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (connection attempt sent, no response) and high packet count with minimal connections strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
