- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.147.107 on port 18012 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
