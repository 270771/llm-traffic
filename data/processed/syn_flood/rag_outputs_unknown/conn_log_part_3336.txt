- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53569 to 133.118.56.129:63676 showing SYN sent (S0) state with 44 packets and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
