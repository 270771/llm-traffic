- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39614 to 203.65.112.172:12567 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and single SYN packet without response strongly aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
