- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including rapid connection resets (RSTR) and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the connection pattern (high reset rate, no established sessions) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack despite lack of anomaly metadata.
