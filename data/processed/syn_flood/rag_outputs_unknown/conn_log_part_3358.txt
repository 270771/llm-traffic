- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 157.161.40.85 to 159.17.193.104 on port 1322 with OTH flag and reset response, indicating incomplete handshake and potential SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of OTH (other) TCP state with a reset (R) and zero payload strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections exhausting resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 157.161.40.85 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
