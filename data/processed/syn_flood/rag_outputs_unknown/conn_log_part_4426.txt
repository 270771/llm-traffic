- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.40.20 on port 21327 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
