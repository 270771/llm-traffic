- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.103.95 on port 1430 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
