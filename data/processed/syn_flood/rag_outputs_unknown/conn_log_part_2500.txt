- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.113.20 on port 8834 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions, indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYNs and no ACKs is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP analysis.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
