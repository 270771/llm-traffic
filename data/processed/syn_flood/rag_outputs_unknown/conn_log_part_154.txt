- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.240.173 on port 20894 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating connections without completing them.
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server’s availability.
