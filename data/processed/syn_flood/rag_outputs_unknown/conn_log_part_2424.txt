- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:17340 to 133.118.56.218:9595 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
