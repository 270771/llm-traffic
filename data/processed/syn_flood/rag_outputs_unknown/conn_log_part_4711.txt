- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.18.195 on port 60001 with SYN packets sent but no connection established (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a sustained SYN flood attack, as the SYN-only packets without completion indicate a classic SYN flood pattern.
