- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.87.66 on port 9000 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
