- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38619 to 202.44.226.22:12322 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no response) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
