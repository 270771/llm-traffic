- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.19.67 on port 12301 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no response, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior disrupting TCP handshake completion.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server.
