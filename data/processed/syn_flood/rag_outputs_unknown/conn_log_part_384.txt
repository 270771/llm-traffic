- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.37.83 on port 17780 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior known to exhaust server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
