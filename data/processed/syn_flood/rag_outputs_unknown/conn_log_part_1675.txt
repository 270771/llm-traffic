- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP flags indicating suspicious connection attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the alert alone indicates potential SYN flood activity despite lack of anomaly data.
