- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.126.133 on port 9943 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag indicates a classic SYN flood pattern where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if the pattern persists to prevent resource exhaustion.
