- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:53260 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing suspicious behavior with RSTR flag and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of repeated SYN attempts with RSTR (Reset) responses and no successful connections on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood patterns. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
