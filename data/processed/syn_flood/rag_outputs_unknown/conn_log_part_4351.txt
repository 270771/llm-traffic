- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 202.44.223.235:9000 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 1 packet and 44 bytes, indicating a SYN without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with no handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator; recommend rate-limiting connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity.
