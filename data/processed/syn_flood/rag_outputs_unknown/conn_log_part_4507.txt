- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54074 to 163.21.249.50:14873 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 0 responses, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple connection attempts and zero completions is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
