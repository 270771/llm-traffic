- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59733 to 133.250.118.134:21001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
