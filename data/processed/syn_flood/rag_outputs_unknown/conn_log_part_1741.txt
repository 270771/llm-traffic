- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.79.152:9000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server at 203.65.79.152:9000 and prevent resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
