- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.207.10:9009 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target service.
