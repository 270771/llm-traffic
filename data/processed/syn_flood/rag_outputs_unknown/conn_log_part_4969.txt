- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:39893 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and no established connection, indicating abnormal TCP behavior consistent with SYN flood characteristics.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for repeated connection attempts and unusual traffic patterns; implement rate-limiting on port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
