- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.31.247:8098 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
