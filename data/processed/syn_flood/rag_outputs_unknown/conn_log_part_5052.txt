- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR flags and multiple retransmissions within a short time frame, indicative of a SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
