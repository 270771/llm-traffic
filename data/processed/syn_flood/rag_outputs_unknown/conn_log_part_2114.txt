- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with a high packet rate (2.989840 packets/sec) and flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists or escalates.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to confirm this alert, the high SYN packet rate targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet) with suspicious TCP flags strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
