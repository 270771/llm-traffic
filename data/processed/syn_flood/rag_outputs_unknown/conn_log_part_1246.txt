- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.51.115 on port 50000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, warranting decisive mitigation.
