- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40401 to 163.21.144.154:20080 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s S0 flag and high SYN count with zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source for potential malicious activity.
