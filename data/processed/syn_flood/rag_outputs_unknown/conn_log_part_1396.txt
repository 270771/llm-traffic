- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.126.29 on port 15 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake) is a well-known indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
