- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23, characterized by rapid connection attempts and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous TCP resets and rapid connection attempts on port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 and rate-limit incoming connections to port 23 to mitigate potential service disruption. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
