- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.39.253:13579 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN attempt without handshake completion (S0), which is a classic SYN flood symptom. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
