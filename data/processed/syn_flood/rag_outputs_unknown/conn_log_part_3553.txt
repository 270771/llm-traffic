- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.135.154 on port 51434 with SYN flag set and no completion of handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
