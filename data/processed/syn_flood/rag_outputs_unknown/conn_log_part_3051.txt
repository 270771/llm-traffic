- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.201.236 on port 5601 with multiple incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 packets, 1 attempt).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 5601 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target service.
