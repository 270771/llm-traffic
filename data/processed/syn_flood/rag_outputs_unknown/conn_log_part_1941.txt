- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49295 to 163.21.24.112:9704 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
