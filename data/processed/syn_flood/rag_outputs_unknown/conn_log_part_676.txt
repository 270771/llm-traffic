- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.154.91 on port 1023 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs with no ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
