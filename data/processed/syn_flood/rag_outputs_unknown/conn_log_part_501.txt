- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.182.132 on port 79 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.182.132. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
