- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.46.167 on port 5000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
