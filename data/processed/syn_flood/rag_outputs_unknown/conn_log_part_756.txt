- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.180.0 on port 3000 with multiple incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the high number of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 3000 and initiate investigation on the source IP for potential blocking.
