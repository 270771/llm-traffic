- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:20133 to 163.21.156.120:9393 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
