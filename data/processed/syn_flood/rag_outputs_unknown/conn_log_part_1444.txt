- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with a SYN flood (high SYN rate, no established connections, RSTR flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity.
