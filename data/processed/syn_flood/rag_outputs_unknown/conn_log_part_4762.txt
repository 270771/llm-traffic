- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid RSTR responses and zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with immediate RST responses on a sensitive port (23 - Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood or scanning attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if behavior persists to protect the target system.
