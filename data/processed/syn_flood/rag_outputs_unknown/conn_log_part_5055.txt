- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.60.92 on port 18035 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to classic SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), which exhausts server resources and disrupts service.
