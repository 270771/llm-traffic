- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.111.180 on port 50998 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
