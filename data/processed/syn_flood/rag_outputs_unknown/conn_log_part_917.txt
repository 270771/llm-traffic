- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.8.29 on port 49152 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target.
