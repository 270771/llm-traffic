- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.192.254 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion).
