- SYN flood alert: TCP traffic from 107.81.9.228:48611 to 202.152.173.202:23 shows rapid connection attempts with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) flags, indicating aborted connections consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes and reset flags on port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly aligns with SYN flood attack characteristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
