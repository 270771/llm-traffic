- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.81.228 on port 45005 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
