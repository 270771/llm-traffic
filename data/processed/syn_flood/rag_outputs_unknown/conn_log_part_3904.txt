- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.176.116 on port 12154 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
