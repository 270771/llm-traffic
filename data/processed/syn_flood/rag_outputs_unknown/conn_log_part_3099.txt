- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:54987 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal SYN behavior with zero successful connections and multiple retransmissions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without successful handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server on port 23.
