- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.160.194 on port 2761 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
