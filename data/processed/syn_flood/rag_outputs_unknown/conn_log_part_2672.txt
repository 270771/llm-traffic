- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56522 to 202.44.255.41:18556 shows a SYN packet with no established connection (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood signature (numerous SYN packets without completion) justifies immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
