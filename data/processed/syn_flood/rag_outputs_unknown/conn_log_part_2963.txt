- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.244.189 on port 54138 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no established connections (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation; consider blocking if attack persists.
