- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 (source port 41809) to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN behavior with zero successful handshakes and RSTR (reset) flags observed, indicating connection refusals.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic volume; consider rate-limiting connections to port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood risk.
