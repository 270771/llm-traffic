- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.126.44 on port 83 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.126.44 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns. If sustained, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
