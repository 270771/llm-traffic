- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.7.146 on port 311 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources.
