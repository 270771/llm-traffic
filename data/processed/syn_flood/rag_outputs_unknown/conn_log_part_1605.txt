- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on port 63841 targeting 8.34.37.255 port 80 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (high SYN packet count, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the alert’s characteristics (high SYN count, no ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 157.161.40.85 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
