- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting 202.36.216.5 on port 2000 with high connection attempt rate (63.39 connections/sec) and no corresponding anomaly record.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic available due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.36.216.5 on port 2000 and initiate investigation of source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the extremely high SYN request rate with no successful handshakes strongly indicates a SYN flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
