- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.36.6 on port 14147 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without ACKs) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential service disruption and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
