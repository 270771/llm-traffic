- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.144.101 on port 20182 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the observed behavior—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, consistent with standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
