- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.4.157 on port 44310 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and zero completions strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where many SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect service availability. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
