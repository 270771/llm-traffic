- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.94.67 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
