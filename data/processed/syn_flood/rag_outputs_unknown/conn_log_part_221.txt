- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.2.155 on port 8060 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
