- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.58.112:1400 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
