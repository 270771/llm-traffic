- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64089 to 133.118.166.43:16098 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, F flags, zero established connections) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.166.43. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
