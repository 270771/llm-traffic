- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.74.202 on port 8834 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with typical SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
