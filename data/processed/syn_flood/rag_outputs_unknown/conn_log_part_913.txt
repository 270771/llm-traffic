- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3152 to 133.250.107.210:9215 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 attempt, 44 bytes sent).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as the single SYN with no response is indicative of a potential SYN flood attempt.
