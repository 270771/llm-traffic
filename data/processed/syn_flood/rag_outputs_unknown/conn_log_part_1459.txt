- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.74.152 on port 8140 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
