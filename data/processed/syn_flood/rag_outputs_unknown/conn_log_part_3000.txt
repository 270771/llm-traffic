- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.104.207 on port 2761 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic DoS indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
