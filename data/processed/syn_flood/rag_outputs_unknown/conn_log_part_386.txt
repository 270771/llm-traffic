- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4781 to 133.118.45.96:15018 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 0 responses, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high packet count without established connections strongly align with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and rate-limit incoming SYN packets to 133.118.45.96:15018 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat intelligence.
