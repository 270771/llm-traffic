- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28079 to 133.118.181.158:548 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
