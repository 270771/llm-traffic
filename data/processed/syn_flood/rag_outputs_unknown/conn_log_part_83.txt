- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.220.176 on port 8889 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
