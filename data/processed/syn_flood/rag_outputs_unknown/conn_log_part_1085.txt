- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.240.82 on port 12318 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on target.
