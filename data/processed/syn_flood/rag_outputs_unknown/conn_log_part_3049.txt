- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.134.190 on port 30001 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent resource exhaustion.
