- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 detected with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and monitor for further SYN flood activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN flags without completion of TCP handshakes on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Proactive blocking is warranted to prevent service disruption.
