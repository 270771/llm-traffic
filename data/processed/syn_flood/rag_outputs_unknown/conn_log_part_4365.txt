- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.35.144 on port 9218 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
