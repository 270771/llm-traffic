- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65086 to 202.44.202.35:12556 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood attacks, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
