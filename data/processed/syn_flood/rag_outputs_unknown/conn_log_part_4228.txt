- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56666 to 133.118.236.57:12340 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this detection. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
