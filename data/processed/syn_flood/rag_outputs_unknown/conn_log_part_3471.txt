- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with repeated RSTR flags and zero successful handshakes, indicating potential SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as repeated RSTR responses and zero handshake completions are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns.
