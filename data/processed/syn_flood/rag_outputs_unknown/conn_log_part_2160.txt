- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.76.67 on port 12540 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
