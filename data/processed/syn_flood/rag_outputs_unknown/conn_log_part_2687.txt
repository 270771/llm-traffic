- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6810 to 203.65.95.215:23184 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 flag, 1 SYN packet, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the presence of a SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
