- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.142.227 on port 4369 show a high number of SYN packets without corresponding completions (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior due to clear pattern of incomplete TCP handshakes indicative of SYN flood attack.
