- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.91.38 on port 1604 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
