- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:65098 to 163.21.107.182:16000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server at 163.21.107.182. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
