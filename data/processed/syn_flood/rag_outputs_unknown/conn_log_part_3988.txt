- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:18687 to 133.118.231.173:12236 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
