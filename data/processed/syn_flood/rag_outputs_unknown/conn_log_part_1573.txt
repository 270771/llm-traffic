- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8713 to 202.44.255.153:12281 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response, indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag with zero completed connections and multiple SYN packets without ACK strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 12281 to mitigate further SYN flood attempts. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
