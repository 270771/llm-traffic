- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22337 to 202.44.230.141:30501 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0 state, multiple SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
