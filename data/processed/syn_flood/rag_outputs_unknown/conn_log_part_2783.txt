- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.151.124 on port 10005 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK or established connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on prior patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
