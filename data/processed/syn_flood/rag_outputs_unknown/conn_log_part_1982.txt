- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.204.216 on port 8472 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
