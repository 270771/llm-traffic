- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65275 to 133.118.80.120:9480 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, causing resource exhaustion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
