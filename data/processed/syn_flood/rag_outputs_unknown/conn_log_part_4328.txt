- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, followed by RSTR (reset) flags indicating connection refusal.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion and reset responses is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector.
