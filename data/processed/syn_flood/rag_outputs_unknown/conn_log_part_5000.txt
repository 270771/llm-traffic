- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 163.21.136.124:1023 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without ACK confirm classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
