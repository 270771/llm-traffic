- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22625 to 133.250.161.183:14895 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
