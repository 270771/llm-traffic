- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13562 to 133.118.53.8:16021 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
