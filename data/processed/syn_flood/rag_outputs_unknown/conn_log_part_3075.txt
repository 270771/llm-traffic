- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and initiate investigation on source IP due to classic SYN flood signature (high SYN count, no ACKs). Implement SYN cookies or firewall rules to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
