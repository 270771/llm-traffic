- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 is initiating numerous TCP SYN packets to destination 133.118.61.69 on port 2222, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this event. However, the connection state S0 and high count of SYN packets without completion is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.61.69 on port 2222 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
