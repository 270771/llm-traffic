- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.54.108 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 1).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
