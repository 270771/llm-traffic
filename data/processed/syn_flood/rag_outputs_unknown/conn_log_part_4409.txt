- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 163.21.233.240:50100 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 attempt, 44 bytes, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
