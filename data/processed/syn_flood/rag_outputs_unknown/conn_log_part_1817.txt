- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 163.21.64.150 to destination 13.111.136.41 on port 443, showing high packet counts and SYN flag set with no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 163.21.64.150 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
