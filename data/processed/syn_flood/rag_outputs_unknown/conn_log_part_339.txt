- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.116.96 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks and poses a denial-of-service threat.
