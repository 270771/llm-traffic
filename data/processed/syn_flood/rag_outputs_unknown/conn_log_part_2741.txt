- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 (Telnet), characterized by multiple SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential resource exhaustion and further attack attempts, and initiate investigation to monitor for additional suspicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of repeated SYN flags without completion of TCP handshake on a sensitive port (23) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior requiring decisive mitigation.
