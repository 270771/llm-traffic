- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42728 to 133.250.146.244:18057 with SYN flag set, resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
