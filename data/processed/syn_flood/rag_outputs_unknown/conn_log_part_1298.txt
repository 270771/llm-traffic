- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 133.250.161.34 to 192.103.164.17 on port 636 with 60 SYN packets and 1 incomplete handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of multiple SYN packets with incomplete handshakes strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 133.250.161.34 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
