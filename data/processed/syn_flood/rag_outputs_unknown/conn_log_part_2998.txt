- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57358 to 202.44.198.89:12459 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without any established connections (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
