- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.121.79 on port 10036 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
