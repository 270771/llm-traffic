- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.11.31 on port 16014 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic and well-documented indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block the IP if the behavior persists to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on the source to confirm intent and prevent further disruption.
