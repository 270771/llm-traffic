- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32080 to 203.65.103.118:14909 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate, but the alert’s pattern (multiple SYNs with no ACKs) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
