- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.242.47 on port 12319 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
