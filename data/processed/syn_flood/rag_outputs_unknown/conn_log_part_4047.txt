- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high source port 63931 targeting destination 8.34.37.255 port 80 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, high packet count 490, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security principles.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 157.161.40.85 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the destination server.
