- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
