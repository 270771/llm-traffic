- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.74.118 on port 25 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as repeated SYNs without handshake completion indicate a classic SYN flood pattern. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
