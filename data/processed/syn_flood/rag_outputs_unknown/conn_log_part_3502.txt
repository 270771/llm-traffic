- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show abnormal SYN behavior with no corresponding established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as the presence of repeated SYN attempts with resets is consistent with SYN flood tactics.
