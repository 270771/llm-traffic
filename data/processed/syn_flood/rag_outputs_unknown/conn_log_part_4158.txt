- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.219.251 on port 44320 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
