- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10663 to 163.21.65.241:12377 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual SYN traffic patterns and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further analysis.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP SYN packet (flag S0) with no established connection, which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate blocking is premature, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting will mitigate potential impact while gathering more data.
