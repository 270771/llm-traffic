- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.237.251 on port 9306 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag (connection attempt seen, no reply) combined with multiple packets and zero established connections strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
