- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40847 to 163.21.177.189:12114 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
