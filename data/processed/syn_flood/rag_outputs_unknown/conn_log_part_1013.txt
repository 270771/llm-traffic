- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31538 to 163.21.50.179:20443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
