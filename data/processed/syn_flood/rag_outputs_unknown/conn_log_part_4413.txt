- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and presence of RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts targeting port 23, as the behavior strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics (high SYN rate, no handshake completion, reset responses).
