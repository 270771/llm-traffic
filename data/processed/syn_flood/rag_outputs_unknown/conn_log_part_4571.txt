- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.132.243 on port 12161 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a coordinated SYN flood attack. Implement temporary blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.
