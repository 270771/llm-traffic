- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.103.119 on port 11112 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 (connection attempt sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
