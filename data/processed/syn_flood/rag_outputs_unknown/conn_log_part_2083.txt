- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.60.195 on port 9811 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state), indicative of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the connection state (S0) and packet pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
