- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48397 to 163.21.231.78:16034 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
