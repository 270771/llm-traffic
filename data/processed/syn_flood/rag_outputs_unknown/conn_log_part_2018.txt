- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.113.169 on port 20512 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood signature—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
