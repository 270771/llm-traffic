- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43811 to 133.118.129.246:12489 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, consistent with known TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
