- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:22456 to 163.21.83.33:21269 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and zero completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple TCP connection attempts with S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and zero successful handshakes strongly aligns with SYN flood behavior. This pattern is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack aiming to exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing them. Given this, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
