- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—high rate of SYN packets (2.825 seconds interval), no established connections (0 ACKs), and TCP flags indicating SYN-only packets—are consistent with classic SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
