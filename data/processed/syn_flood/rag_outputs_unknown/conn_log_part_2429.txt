- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.97.224 on port 12902 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
