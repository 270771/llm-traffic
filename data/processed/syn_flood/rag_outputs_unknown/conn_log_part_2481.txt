- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with a high frequency (2.947559 seconds interval, multiple SYN flags without completion).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion to port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity. Consider blocking if the behavior persists.
