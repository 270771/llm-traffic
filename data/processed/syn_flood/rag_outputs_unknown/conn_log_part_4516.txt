- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28317 to 202.44.224.226:12132 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 0 established) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server 202.44.224.226.
