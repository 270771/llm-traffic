- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.249.183 on port 44818 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, consistent with standard TCP anomaly detection principles.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
