- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53691 to 163.21.144.186:21515 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s S0 flag and high packet count with zero established connections align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.
