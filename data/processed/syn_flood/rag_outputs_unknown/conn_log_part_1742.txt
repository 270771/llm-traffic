- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33297 to 163.21.202.0:16103 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, no connection established, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
