- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.121.54 on port 2000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
