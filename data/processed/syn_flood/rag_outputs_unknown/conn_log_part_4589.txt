- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.28.157 on port 15082 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the TCP handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.28.157. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
