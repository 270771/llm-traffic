- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with high SYN packet ratio and no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows characteristics typical of a SYN flood—high SYN packet ratio with no successful connection establishment and reset responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating many half-open connections. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
