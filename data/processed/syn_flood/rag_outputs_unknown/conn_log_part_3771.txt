- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.139.38 on port 8200 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
