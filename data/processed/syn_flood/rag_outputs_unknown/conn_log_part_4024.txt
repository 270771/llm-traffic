- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.52.122 on port 12498 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
