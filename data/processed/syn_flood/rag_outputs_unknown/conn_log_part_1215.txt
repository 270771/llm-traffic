- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:17189 to 133.118.182.119:12201 with SYN packets but no completion (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
