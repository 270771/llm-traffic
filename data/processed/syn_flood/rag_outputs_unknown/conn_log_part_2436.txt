- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.232.128 on port 16023 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the observed S0 flag with zero completed connections is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
