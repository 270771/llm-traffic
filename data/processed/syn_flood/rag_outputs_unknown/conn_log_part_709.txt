- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 133.250.78.243:28776 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with zero packets and one byte, indicating incomplete handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 133.250.78.243 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of OTH (other) TCP flag with zero packets and incomplete handshake is a known symptom of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources. Without anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and cautious rate-limiting are warranted.
