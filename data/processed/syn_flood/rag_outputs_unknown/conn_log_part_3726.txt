- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:57841 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing RSTR flag with no established session, high packet rate (0.793315), and multiple retransmissions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the presence of repeated SYN attempts with RSTR responses and high connection rate to port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting a vulnerable service.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation; consider blocking if traffic persists or escalates.
