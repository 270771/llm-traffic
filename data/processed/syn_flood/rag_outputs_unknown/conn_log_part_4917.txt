- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.120.60 on port 1599 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
