- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.28.159 on port 7443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
