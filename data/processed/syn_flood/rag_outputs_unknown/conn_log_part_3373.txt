- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.123.201 on port 21275 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
