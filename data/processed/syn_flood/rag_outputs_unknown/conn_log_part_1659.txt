- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7364 to 133.118.219.8:30112 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
