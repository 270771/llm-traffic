- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 (source port 35407) to 203.65.53.120 on port 9400 show a pattern of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no response) align with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 9400 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
