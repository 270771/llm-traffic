- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.70.63 on port 17000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
