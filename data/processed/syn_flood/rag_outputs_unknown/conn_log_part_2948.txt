- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 55453 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating SYN+ACK (SH) and multiple connection attempts within 2.85 seconds.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking connections to port 23 to prevent potential SYN flood exploitation of Telnet service.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the rapid repeated TCP connection attempts with SYN-related flags to a commonly targeted port (23) strongly indicate SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and protective measures are warranted.
