- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.98 on port 9160 show 253 SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RST responses within 4.46 seconds, indicating rapid connection initiation without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the volume and failure pattern strongly indicate a SYN flood attack despite lack of anomaly records.
