- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.119.0 on port 548 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the S0 flag with repeated SYNs and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
