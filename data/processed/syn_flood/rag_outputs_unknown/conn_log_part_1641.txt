- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.157.192 on port 11300 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, single SYN packet count, no ACKs) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by resource exhaustion through half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
