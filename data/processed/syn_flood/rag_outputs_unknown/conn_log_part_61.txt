- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with a SYN flood, including a high number of connection attempts and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further potential SYN flood activity, as the connection pattern and reset responses strongly indicate a denial-of-service attempt.
