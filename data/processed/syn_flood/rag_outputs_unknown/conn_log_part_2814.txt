- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.77.77 on port 10892 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
