- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.143.141:10243 showing SYN packets with no established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets without completion.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect target 133.250.143.141.
