- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.174.168 on port 80 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
