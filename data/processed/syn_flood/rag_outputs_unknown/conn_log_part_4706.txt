- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.226.152 on port 40894 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
