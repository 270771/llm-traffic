- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:20217 to 133.118.55.19:8333 shows S0 flag with 1 attempt and 44 bytes, indicating a SYN packet sent without completion of handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
