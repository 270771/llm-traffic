- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.64.170 on port 18005 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of numerous S0 flags (SYN sent, no response) and a high count of connection attempts (44) with zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
