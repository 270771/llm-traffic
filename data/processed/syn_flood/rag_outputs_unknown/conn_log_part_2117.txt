- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 42428 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, multiple SYNs, zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target’s TCP handshake capacity.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion on 202.152.173.202 port 23. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
