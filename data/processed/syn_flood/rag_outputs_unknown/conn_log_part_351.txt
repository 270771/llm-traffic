- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.55.162 on port 10001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
