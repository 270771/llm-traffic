- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.144.156 on port 16993 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag in TCP connection states is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
