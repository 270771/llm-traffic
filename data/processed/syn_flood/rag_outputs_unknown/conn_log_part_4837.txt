- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.108.70 on port 21288 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern (many SYNs, no completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
