- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.199.26 on port 2002 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.199.26 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
