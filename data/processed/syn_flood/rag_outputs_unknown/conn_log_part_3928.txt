- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28693 to 133.250.83.227:70 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns known in cybersecurity.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
