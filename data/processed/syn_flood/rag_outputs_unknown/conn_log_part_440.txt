- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58011 to 202.44.233.45:12488 shows a SYN packet with no established connection (S0 flag), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
