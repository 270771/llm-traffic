- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with classic SYN flood behavior aimed at exhausting server resources.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server on port 23.
