- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 133.118.113.78:57257 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and 60 bytes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 133.118.113.78 for unusual connection patterns and monitor traffic to port 636; consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further data.

**Explanation:** Without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is not possible. However, the presence of a SYN packet with OTH flag and minimal response suggests a potential SYN flood attempt. Proactive investigation and rate-limiting are prudent to mitigate risk.
