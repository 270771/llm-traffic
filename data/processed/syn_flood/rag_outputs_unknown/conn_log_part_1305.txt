- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228:33851 targeting 202.152.173.202:23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack aimed at exhausting server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
