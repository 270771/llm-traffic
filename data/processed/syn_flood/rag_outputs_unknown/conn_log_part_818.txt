- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14726 to 133.118.253.249:50113 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
