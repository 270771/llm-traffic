- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 163.21.51.229:9999 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
