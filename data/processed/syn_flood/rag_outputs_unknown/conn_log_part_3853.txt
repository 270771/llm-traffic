- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:37948 to 163.21.7.199:11065 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
