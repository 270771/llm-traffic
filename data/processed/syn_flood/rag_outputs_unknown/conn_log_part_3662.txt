- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.105.218 on port 30452 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK response, multiple half-open connections) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
