- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3932 to 133.118.163.207:12564 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 SYN packet, indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and high number of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends many SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
