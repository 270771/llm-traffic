- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.251.207 on port 12492 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server’s resources.
