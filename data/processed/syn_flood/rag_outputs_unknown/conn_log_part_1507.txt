- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30378 to 163.21.181.56:389 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target service.
