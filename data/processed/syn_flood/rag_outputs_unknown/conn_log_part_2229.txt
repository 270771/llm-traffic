- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.162.188 on port 5801 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system.
