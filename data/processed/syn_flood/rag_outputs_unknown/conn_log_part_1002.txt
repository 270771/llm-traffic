- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.47.25 on port 12139 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and repeated SYNs without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
