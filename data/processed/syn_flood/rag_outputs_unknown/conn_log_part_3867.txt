- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41974 to 133.250.83.123:22084 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 flags indicate incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
