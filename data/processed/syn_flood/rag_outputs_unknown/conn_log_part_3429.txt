- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.250.79 on port 9992 show a pattern of SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without ACK) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
