- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:38291 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and implement rate-limiting on port 23 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.

Despite lack of explicit anomaly data or heuristics, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on a commonly targeted port (23, Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt requiring immediate mitigation.
