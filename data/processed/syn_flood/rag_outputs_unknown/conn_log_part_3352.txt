- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.223.154 on port 35524 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a possible SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as it shows incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
