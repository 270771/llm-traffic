- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59242 to 133.250.148.51:17775 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP connection heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
