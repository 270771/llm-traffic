- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16785 to 133.118.41.134:10009 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 44 SYNs, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
