- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 163.21.80.220:14147 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.80.220, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Further investigation of the source is recommended.
