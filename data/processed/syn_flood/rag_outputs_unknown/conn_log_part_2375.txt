- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.142.50 on port 30001 with multiple SYN flags and zero established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
