- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.177.109 on port 8060, characterized by multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert details showing numerous SYN requests without completion.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent. Implement rate-limiting on port 8060 to mitigate impact.
