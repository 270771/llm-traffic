- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53148 to 133.118.222.110:44310 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
