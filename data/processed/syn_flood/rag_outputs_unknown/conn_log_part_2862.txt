- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:31679 to 163.21.235.100:17184 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system.
