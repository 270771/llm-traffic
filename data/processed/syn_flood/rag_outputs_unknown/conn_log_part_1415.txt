- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:35994 to 133.250.184.128:12574 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or established connections (flag S0, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
