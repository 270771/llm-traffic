- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.108.20 on port 15 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.108.20 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
