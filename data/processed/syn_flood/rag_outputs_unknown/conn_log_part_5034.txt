- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.38.120 on port 8086 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion on 203.65.38.120 and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
