- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.207.153 on port 20000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
