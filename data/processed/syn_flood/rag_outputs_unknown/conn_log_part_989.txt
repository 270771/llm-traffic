- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.161.58 on port 3000, characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 and rate-limit incoming SYN packets on port 3000 to prevent service disruption, then investigate source further.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristics, the presence of multiple incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, warranting decisive mitigation.
