- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13177 to 133.250.114.22:11075 showing S0 state with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN packets with no completions (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
