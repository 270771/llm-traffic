- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58486 to 163.21.103.161:65432 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly correspond to classic SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block the IP if the behavior persists to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source to confirm intent and prevent further disruption.
