- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on port 63919 targeting 192.222.97.252 port 443 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, high packet count 1348, zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP flood heuristics.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 157.161.40.85 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
