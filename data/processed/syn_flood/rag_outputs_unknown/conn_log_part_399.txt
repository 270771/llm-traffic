- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by RSTR flags and zero accepted connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern aligns with typical SYN flood behavior despite lack of formal anomaly data.
