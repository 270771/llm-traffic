- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.66.128 on port 29984 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
