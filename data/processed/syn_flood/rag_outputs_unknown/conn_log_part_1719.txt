- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35585 to 133.250.135.226:44300 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion strongly align with standard SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
