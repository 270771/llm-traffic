- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24366 to 133.250.177.57:2404 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
