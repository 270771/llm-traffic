- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40383 to 133.118.74.212:18060 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior (S0 state with no completion).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
