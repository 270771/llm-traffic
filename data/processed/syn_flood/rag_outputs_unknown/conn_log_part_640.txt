- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.47.249:7779 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating connection attempts without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood behavior (SYN packets sent without ACKs), which is a known threat pattern. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
