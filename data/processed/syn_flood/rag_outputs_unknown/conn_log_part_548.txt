- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.14.111 on port 16993 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 16993 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement temporary blocking if traffic persists.
