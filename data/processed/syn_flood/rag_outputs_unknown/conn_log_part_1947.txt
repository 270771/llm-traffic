- SYN flood alert: High-volume TCP SYN packets from source IP 157.161.40.85 to destination 8.34.37.255 on port 80, with 490 SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections typical of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the volume and pattern of SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 157.161.40.85 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and service disruption.
