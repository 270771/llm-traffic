- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.223.85 on port 12321 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
