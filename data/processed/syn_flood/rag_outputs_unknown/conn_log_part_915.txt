- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:60169 to 202.152.173.202:23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior, including a high rate of SYN packets without successful handshakes, indicated by zero established connections and multiple reset responses (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN attempts with no completions and reset flags—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 202.152.173.202 port 23. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
