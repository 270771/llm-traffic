- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7193 to 163.21.178.112:14406 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
