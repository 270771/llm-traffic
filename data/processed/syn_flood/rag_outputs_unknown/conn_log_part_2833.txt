- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.11.220 on port 8888 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
