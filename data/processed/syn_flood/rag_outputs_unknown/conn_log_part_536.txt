- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.239.2 on port 51235 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately and monitor for further SYN flood activity, as the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with repeated SYNs and no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of a denial-of-service attack.
