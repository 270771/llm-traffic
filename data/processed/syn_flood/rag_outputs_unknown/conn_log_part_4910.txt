- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.183.156 on port 54321 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP handshakes without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system. Initiate further monitoring to detect any escalation or related suspicious activity.
