- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41563 to 203.65.100.187:16037 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 203.65.100.187 from resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
