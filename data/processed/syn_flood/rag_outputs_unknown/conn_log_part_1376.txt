- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.29.124 on port 18098 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
