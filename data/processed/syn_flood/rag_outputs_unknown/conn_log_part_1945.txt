- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP flags indicating repeated SYN attempts and RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without successful connection establishment aligns with typical SYN flood behavior, characterized by overwhelming a target with half-open TCP connections.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
