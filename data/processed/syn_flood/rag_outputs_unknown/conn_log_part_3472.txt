- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 detected with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks targeting port 23 (Telnet), which is commonly exploited.
