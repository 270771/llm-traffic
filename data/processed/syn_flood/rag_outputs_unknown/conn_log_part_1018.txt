- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.214.96 on port 12264 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert flags (S0, no ACKs, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
