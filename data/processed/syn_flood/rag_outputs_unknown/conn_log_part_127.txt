- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.44.124 on port 6364 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
