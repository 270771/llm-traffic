- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.28.63 on port 9299 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristics, the presence of SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
