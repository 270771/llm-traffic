- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 sent 15 TCP SYN packets to destination 133.118.101.5 on port 24858, with all connections in S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion is a definitive indicator of SYN flood attack.
