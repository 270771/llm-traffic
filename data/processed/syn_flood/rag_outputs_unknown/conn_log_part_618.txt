- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228:52447 to 202.152.173.202:23 with suspicious TCP flags and packet counts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for further suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN flood characteristics (e.g., TCP flags and packet counts), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
