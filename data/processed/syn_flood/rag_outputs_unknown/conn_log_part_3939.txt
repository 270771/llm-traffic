- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.47.25 on port 11601 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK response, indicating a half-open connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious traffic.
