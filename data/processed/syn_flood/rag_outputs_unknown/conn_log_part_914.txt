- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48023 to 133.250.132.169:12261 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous half-open connections (S0 state) causing resource exhaustion.
