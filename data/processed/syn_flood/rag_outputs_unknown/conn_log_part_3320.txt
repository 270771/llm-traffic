- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:52501 to 202.152.173.202:23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) responses within 0.396 seconds.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the rapid SYN attempts with no handshake completion and multiple resets strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt targeting port 23 (Telnet). Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect the service.
