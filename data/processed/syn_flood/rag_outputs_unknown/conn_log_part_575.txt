- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.152.10 on port 9600 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 9600 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server’s resources. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
