- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.204.148 on port 15 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target.
