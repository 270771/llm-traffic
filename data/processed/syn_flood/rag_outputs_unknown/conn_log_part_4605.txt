- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.58.8 on ports 10484 → 12251 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
