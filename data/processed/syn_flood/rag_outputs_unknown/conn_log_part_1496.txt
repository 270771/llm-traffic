- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65331 to 163.21.232.112:12384 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
