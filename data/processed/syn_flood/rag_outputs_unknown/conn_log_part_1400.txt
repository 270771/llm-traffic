- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.221.145 on port 4506 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Investigate source further for malicious intent.
