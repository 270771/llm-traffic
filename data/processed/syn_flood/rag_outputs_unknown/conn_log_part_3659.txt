- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:40678 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as the absence of established connections combined with resets is indicative of SYN flood behavior.
