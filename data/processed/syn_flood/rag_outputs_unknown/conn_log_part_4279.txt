- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29409 to 133.118.123.26:17780 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
