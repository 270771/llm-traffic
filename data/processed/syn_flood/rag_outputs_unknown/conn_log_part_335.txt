- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38797 to 133.118.212.29:12545 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server 133.118.212.29. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
