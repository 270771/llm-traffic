- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 55776 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets with suspicious TCP flags targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent service disruption and investigate further network logs for corroborating evidence.
