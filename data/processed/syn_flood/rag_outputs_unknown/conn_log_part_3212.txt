- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding established connections, ending in RSTR (reset) flags, indicating connection refusals.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as repeated connection resets on port 23 (Telnet) are suspicious and may indicate scanning or attack attempts.
