- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.136.231 on port 5901 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system.
