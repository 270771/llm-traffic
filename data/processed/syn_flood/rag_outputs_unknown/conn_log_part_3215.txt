- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19330 to 133.250.91.23:2345 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
