- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30914 to 133.118.243.130:12476 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
