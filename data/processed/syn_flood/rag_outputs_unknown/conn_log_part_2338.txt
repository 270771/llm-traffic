- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37554 to 133.118.151.249:9507 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
