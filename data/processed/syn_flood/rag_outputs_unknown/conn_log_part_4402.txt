- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no corresponding established connections, ending in RSTR (reset) responses, indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the pattern of SYN packets without successful connection establishment and reset responses aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
