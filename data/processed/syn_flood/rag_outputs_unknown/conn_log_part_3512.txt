- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.195.215 on port 10892 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm server resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
