- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show a high rate of SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets and no connection establishment on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
