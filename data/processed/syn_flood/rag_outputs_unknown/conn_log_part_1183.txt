- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.8.55:50070 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 retransmissions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN flood behavior (many SYNs without completion), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
