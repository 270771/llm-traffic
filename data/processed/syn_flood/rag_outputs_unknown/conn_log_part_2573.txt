- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.131.207 on port 12198 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
