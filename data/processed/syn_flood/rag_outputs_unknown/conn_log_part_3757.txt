- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:63336 to 163.21.221.29:10013 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server 163.21.221.29 from resource exhaustion.  

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN packets and no handshake completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks and warrants immediate blocking of the source IP.
