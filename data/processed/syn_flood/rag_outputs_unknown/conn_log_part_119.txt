- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with a SYN flood, including a high rate of SYN packets and no successful connection establishment (indicated by RSTR flags and zero completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact on port 23 services.
