- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51748 to 163.21.145.35:50012 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
