- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.97.127 on port 3389 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts targeting port 3389 (RDP), as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a definitive indicator of a SYN flood attack.
