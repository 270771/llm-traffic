- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.67.78 on port 9306 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
