- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:22369 to 163.21.123.213:6379 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 6379. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
