- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23055 to 133.250.172.49:45667 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without any connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
