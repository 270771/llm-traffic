- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.153.141 on port 52010 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is confirmed.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent (S flag = 1) with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to confirm this automatically, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood patterns where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources. Therefore, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
