- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.53.30 on port 6001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior due to clear signs of SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion).
