- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.234.12:33060 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
