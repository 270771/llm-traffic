- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:14861 to 163.21.252.31:119 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with no ACKs) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
