- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.138.219 on port 8649 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
