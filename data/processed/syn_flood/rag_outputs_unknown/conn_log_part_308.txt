- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.124.201 on port 9210 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
