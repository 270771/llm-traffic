- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:37423 to 133.118.187.51:9441 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.187.51. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
