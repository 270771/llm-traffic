- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.90 on port 10000 with 39 SYN packets sent in 4.78 seconds, no corresponding ACKs, and multiple RSTR flags observed.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake and RSTR flags indicating reset responses. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
