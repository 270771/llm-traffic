- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.241.89 on port 7071 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
