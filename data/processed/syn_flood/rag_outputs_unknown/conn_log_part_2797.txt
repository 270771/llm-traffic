- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.116.208 on port 4782 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the SYN-only connection pattern with no ACKs strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt.)
