- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.95.199 on port 15123 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets sent without completion.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
