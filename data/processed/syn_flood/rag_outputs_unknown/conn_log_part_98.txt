- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the pattern of SYNs without ACKs and presence of RSTR flags strongly suggests SYN flood activity.)
