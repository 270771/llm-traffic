- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.70.175 on port 15 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature requiring immediate mitigation.
