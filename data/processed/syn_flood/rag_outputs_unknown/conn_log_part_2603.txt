- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44364 to 163.21.130.33:18025 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
