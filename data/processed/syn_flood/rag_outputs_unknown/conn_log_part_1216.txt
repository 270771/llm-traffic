- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20621 to 133.118.206.18:12182 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous half-open TCP connections (S0 state) with SYN flags and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
