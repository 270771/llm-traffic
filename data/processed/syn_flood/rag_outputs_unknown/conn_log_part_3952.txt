- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57070 to 202.152.173.18:12185 showing rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and multiple retransmissions, resulting in REJ (reject) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without successful handshakes and REJ responses—are consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
