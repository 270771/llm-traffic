- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30139 to 163.21.152.17:2181 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target service on port 2181.
