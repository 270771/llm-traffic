- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.146.18 on port 9080 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag, many SYNs, zero completions) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
