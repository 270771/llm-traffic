- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36908 to 133.250.150.46:12255 with SYN flag set, no response, indicating a SYN flood pattern (S0 state, 1 SYN packet, no ACK).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with single SYN and no handshake completion) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
