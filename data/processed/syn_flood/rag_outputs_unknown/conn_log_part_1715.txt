- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29582 to 203.65.98.244:51235 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
