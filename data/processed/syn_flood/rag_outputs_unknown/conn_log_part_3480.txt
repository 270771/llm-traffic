- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16839 to 163.21.199.224:61619 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood attack patterns characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
