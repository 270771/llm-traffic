- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21162 to 133.118.168.245:30006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.168.245. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
