- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.68.83 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect target 203.65.68.83.
