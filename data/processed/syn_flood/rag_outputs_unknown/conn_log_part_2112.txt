- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN requests with zero successful handshakes and multiple RST responses, indicating connection refusal.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of repeated SYNs with no established connections and RST responses is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
