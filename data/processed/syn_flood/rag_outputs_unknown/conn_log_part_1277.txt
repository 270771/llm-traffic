- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed behavior—high SYN rate with no connection establishment and reset responses—is characteristic of a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet). Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
