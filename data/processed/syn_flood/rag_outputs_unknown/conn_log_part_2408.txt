- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.112.151 on port 3299 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
