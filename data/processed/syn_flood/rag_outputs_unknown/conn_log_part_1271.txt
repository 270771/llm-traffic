- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.37.96 on port 53806 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
