- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.24.191 on port 13084 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
