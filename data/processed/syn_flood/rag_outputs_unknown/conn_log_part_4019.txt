- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43223 to 133.118.205.152:12374 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
