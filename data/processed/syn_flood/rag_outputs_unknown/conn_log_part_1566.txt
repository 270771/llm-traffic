- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.87.238 on port 9241 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
