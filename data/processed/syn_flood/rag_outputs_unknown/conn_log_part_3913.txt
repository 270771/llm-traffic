- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.119.224 on port 631 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a count of 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
