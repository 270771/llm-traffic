- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.183.212:5000 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
