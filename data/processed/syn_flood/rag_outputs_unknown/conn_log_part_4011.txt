- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.67.170 on port 5269 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with high SYN count and zero completions is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
