- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.237.157 on port 16031 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the presence of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
