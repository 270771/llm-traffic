- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55985 to 203.65.13.40:18001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0 state with SYN sent but no ACK received) aligns with classic SYN flood heuristics where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
