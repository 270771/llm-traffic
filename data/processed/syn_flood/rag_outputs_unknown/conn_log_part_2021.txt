- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23, showing multiple SYN flags with no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of repeated SYN flags without completion of the TCP handshake on a sensitive port (23, typically Telnet) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack and warrants decisive blocking action.
