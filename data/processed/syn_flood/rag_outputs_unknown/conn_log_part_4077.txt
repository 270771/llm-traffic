- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:22461 to 133.118.92.38:21277 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and zero completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a SYN flood attack, as the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
