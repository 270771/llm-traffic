- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.14.60 on port 8010 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to corroborate this detection. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic and well-documented indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
