- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.222.46 on port 104 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
