- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 179.236.115.64:57685 to 163.21.148.140:23 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 179.236.115.64 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
