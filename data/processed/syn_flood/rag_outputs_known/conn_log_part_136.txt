- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.118.70.251:4321 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
