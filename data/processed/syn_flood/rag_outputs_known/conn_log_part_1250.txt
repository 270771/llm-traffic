- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 7605 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 133.118.119.233 port 1599, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
