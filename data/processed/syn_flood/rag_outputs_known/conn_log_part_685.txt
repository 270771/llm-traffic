- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.39.170 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target.
