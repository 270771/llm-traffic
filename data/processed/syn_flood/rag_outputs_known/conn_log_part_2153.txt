- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.175.209 on port 49690 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with known SYN flood behavior—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
