- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.131.106 on ports 14562 → 18245 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system.
