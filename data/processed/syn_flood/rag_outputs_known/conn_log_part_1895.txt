- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 47965 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (multiple SYN packets, no ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
