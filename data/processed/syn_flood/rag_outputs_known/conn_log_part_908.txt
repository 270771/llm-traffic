- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.91.192 on port 24084 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of a SYN packet with no corresponding response (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Without additional anomaly records or heuristics, a cautious approach is to monitor and investigate the source IP before applying stricter controls.
