- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.214.33 on port 50443 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, indicating a half-open connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
