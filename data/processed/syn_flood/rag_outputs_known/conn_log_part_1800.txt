- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.73.97 on ports 16972 → 18062 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
