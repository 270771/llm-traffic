- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.191.28 on port 70 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK or established connection (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows many half-open connections exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
