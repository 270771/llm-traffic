- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.128.67 on port 8123 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
