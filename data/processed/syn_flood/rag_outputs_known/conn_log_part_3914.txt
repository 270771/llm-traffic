- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:34783 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no corresponding anomaly records.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic context available to confirm SYN flood patterns.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection attempts and monitor traffic to port 23; consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further data.

**Explanation:**  
Although the alert indicates potential SYN flood characteristics (e.g., rapid SYN attempts with no successful handshake), the absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents definitive confirmation. Immediate blocking is premature; however, proactive investigation and traffic control are warranted to mitigate potential risk.
