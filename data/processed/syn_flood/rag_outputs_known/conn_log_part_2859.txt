- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.189.32 on port 12980 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
