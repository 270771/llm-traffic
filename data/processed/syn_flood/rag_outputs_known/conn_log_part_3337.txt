- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.16.4 on port 9998 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state), consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the connection pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a definitive indicator of SYN flood attacks.
