- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.63.20 on port 9207 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
