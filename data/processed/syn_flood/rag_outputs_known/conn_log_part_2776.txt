- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52842 to 203.65.108.18:14084 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
