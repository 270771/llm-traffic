- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.174.239 on port 6668 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no ACK) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the TCP handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target system. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
