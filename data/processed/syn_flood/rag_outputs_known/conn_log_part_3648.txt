- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42949 to 133.250.188.255:45002 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
