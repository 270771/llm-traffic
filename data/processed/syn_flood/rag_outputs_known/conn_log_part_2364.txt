- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.172.103 on port 4911 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
