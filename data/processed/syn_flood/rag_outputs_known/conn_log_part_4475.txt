- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.26.104 on port 11000 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
