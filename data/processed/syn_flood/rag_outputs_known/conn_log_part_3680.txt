- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:11284 to 163.21.169.135:135 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
