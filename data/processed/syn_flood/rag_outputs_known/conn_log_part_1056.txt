- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9041 to 163.21.144.27:44304 showing S0 state with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets with no completions (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect resources.
