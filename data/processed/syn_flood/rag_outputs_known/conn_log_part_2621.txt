- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:64842 to 163.21.2.202:12415 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
