- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:27045 to 163.21.8.200:19084 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
