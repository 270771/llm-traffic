- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.72.40:8069 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets (flag S0) without completing the handshake, indicating possible resource exhaustion attempts. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
