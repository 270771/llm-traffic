- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57639 to 133.118.14.231:21288 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.14.231. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
