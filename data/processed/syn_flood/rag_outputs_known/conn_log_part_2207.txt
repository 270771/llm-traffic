- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.225.251 on port 20000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further monitoring to detect any escalation or additional suspicious activity.
