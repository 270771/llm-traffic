- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228:33801 to 202.152.173.202:23 detected with OTH flag and FR state, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (OTH flag) and failed connection attempts (FR state) on port 23 (Telnet) strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts targeting port 23 and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
