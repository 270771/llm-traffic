- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23, with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F, 0, F, 1, 40).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets with suspicious flags to port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood attack behavior. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
