- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.17.28 on port 12465 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server’s resources.
