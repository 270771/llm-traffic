- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.168.156 on port 16055 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the single SYN packet without follow-up, consistent with SYN flood behavior where many SYNs are sent without completing handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated connection attempts; if volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
