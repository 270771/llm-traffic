- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.254.225 on port 11300 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 11300 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to incomplete handshake pattern consistent with SYN flood attacks.
