- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 157.161.144.77:4443 to 185.212.195.50:60594 showing OTH flag with reset and retransmission counts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 157.161.144.77 for unusual connection patterns and monitor traffic volume; apply rate-limiting if high SYN rates persist.

**Explanation:** Without anomaly data or heuristic context, this event cannot be definitively classified as a SYN flood. However, the presence of OTH (other) TCP flag and reset counts suggests abnormal connection behavior warranting further investigation and proactive rate-limiting to mitigate potential SYN flood risk.
