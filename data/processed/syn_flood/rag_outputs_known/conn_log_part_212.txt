- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.90.250 on port 8098 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN flood behavior due to SYN packets without completion, but confirmation requires further investigation.
