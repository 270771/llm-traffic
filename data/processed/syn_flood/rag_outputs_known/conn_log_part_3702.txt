- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.247.83 on port 9251 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
