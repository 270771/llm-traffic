- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:15433 to 163.21.117.192:445 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of a SYN packet without response on port 445 (commonly targeted for exploitation) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity.
