- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.244.174:3542 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 flag, 44 packets, 0 responses).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets with no handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
