- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no connection establishment and reset responses on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
