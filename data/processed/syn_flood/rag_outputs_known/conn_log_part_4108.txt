- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; heuristic context unavailable to provide formal taxonomy or heuristic ID.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 107.81.9.228 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent, as the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
