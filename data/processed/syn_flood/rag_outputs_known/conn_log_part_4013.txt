- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.73.10 on port 11 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and repeated SYNs without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
