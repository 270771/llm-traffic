- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.44.92 on ports 21923 → 19084 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no ACK response) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
