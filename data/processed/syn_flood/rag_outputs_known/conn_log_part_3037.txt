- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.62.69 on port 45001 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block if the behavior persists to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
