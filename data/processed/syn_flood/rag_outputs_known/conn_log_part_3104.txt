- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54397 to 163.21.192.205:14523 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 163.21.192.205 from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
