- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.140.34 on port 55555 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate investigation on source to confirm intent and monitor for further suspicious activity.
