- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36074 to 163.21.243.23:21310 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 163.21.243.23. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
