- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41189 to 163.21.185.195:30019 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
