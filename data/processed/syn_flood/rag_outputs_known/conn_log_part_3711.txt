- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 157.161.40.85 to 8.34.37.255 on port 80 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and RSTOS0 flags indicating reset without established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 157.161.40.85 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without connection establishment and RST resets is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
