- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26312 to 163.21.58.219:1433 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) targeting port 1433 (commonly MS SQL Server) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the service.
