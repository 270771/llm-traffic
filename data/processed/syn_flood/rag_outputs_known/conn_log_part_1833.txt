- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 157.161.40.85 to 192.222.97.253 on port 3478 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 157.161.40.85 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server, and initiate investigation of the source IP for malicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, justifying proactive mitigation.
