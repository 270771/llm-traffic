- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.27.211 on port 119 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.27.211 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly confirmation but clear SYN flood signature.
