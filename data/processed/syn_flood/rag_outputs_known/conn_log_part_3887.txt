- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.70.90 on ports 17719 → 19091 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly records and heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect service availability.
