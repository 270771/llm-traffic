- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.172.52 on port 11 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator; immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent service disruption.
