- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30139 to 202.44.244.223:2181 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 202.44.244.223 port 2181, as the pattern of SYN without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
