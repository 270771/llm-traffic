- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.145.126 on port 9090 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern. However, the presence of numerous S0 flags (SYN sent, no response) and a high count of such attempts (44) strongly aligns with known SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.145.126 port 9090 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
