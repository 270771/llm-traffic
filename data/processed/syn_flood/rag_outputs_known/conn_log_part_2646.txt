- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.17.92 on port 12115 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
