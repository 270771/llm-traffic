- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.41.21 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and implement rate-limiting or block if confirmed as malicious to prevent resource exhaustion.
