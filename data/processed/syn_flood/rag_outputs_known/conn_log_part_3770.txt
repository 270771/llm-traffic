- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.144.8 on port 8554 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
