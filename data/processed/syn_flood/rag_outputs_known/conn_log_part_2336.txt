- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11661 to 203.65.37.74:12109 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
