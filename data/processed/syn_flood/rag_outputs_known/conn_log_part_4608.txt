- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11920 to 133.118.80.115:9289 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F) and connection pattern (single SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
