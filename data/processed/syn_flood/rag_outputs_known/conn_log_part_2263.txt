- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63892 to 203.65.117.16:12245 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
