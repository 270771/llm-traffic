- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:15601 to 163.21.8.127:10089 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
