- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27337 to 133.250.144.254:16069 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior (S0 state with zero established connections).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
