- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.88.65 on port 17776 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and zero ACK responses are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
