- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.118.30.0:21 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server on port 21.
