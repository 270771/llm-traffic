- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.219.0 on port 41800 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system.
