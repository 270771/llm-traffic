- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9337 to 133.250.161.252:12370 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and the presence of SYN packets without completion, which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target 133.250.161.252. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
