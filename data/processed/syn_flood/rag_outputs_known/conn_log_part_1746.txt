- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:31516 to 133.250.165.74:4500 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 ACKs).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.250.165.74 port 4500. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
