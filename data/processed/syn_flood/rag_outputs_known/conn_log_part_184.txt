- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55618 to 163.21.6.123:12155 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood heuristics, where attackers send numerous SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
