- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.218.217 on port 37777 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where connection attempts are not completed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
