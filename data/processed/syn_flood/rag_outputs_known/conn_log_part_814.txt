- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49118 to 163.21.254.175:12219 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
