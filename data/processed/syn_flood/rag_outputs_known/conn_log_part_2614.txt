- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.255.251 on ports 24425 → 12384 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if flooding persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
