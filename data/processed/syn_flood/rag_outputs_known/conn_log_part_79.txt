- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.213.29 on port 9009 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYNs and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
