- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.29.51:5985 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) indicates a SYN flood pattern. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
