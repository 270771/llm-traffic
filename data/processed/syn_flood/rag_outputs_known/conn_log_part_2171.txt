- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.163.73 on port 12302 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the S0 flag indicates a SYN packet sent without a completed handshake, a classic symptom of SYN flood attacks. Without anomaly data, confirmation is limited, but the behavior aligns with known SYN flood patterns. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
