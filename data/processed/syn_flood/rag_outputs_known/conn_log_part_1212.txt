- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.14.187 on port 12518 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; no heuristic context available to further classify or explain the behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood pattern persists, as the single SYN with no response is indicative of a potential SYN flood attempt.
