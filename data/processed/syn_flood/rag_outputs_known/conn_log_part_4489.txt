- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.250.136.98:8140 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
