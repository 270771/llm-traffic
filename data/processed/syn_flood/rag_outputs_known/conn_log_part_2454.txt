- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60384 to 133.118.178.225:18022 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
