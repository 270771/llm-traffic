- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.111.69 on port 9350 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
