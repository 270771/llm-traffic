  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—multiple SYN attempts without handshake completion (S0 flag), indicating a likely SYN flood. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
