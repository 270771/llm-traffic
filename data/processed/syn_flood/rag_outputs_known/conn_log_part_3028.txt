- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.57.89 on port 9658 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
