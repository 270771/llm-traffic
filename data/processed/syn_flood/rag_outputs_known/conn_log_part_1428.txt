- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate network logs for additional suspicious activity.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet), which is a known attack vector. Blocking the source IP is a necessary defensive measure to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
