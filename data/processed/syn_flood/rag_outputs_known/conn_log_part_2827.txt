- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50050 to 133.118.82.223:50006 with SYN packets sent but no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no ACK response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
