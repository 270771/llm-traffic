- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.144.17 on port 9308 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
