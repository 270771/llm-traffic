- Ping flood alert: 1641790994.327747 CrDgM1HZ8jrxoyb96 167.249.133.167 10889 → 133.250.135.119 22206 tcp S0 F F 0 S 1 44 0 0 - 6  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available. The alert shows TCP SYN packets with no established connection (S0 flag), which is consistent with a SYN flood rather than an ICMP ping flood.  
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood attack and consider rate-limiting or blocking TCP SYN packets from this IP.
