- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28083 to 133.118.203.213:12212 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of S0 (SYN sent, no response) with multiple SYN attempts and zero established connections is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
