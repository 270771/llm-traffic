- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.102.109 on port 110 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, single SYN packet count, zero completions) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and maintain service availability.
