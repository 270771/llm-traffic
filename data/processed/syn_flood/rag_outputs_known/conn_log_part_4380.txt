- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.138.101 on port 21313 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source for potential malicious activity.
