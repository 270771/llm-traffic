- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.70.241 on port 19 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
