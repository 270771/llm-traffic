- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:44049 to 203.65.34.85:44400 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or session completion (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for malicious activity.
