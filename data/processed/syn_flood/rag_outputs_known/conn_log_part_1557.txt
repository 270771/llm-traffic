- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.250.100.105:7443 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
