- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.82.100 on port 4063 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
