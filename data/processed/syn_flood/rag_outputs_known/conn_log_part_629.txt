- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.118.88 on port 11480 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.118.88. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
