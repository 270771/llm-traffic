- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41366 to 133.118.191.230:21288 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood symptom—numerous SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by leaving connections half-open. Without anomaly records, a cautious approach is to monitor and investigate the source IP and apply rate-limiting or blocking if attack patterns persist.
