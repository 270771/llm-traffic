- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53492 to 133.118.165.72:18225 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection failure metrics (1 SYN sent, 0 ACK received) align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
