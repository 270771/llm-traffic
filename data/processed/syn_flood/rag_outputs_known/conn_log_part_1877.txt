- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60377 to 133.250.74.76:12560 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN-only connection attempts with zero completions (S0) are a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
