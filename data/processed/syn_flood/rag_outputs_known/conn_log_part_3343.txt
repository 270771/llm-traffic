- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 initiated a TCP connection to destination 163.21.116.71 on port 12450 with a SYN packet but no established connection (S0 state), sending 44 SYN packets without completing handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
