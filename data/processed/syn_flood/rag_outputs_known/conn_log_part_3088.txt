- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.222.117 on port 11920 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK received).
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server’s resources.
