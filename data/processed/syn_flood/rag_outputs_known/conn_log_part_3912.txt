- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.72.159 on port 9000 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags and connection behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
