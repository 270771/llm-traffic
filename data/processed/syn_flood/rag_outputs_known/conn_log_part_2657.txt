- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.48.13 on port 2762 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
