- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.161.44 on port 503 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
