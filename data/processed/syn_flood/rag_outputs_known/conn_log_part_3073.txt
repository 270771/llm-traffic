- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:29484 to 133.250.84.234:47984 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN attempts (44) without completion strongly align with SYN flood heuristics documented in standard TCP anomaly taxonomies, where numerous half-open connections indicate resource exhaustion attempts.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect target server resources.
