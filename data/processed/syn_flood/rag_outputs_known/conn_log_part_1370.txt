- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7348 to 133.118.219.169:9189 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs or established sessions—match classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target with half-open connections.
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
