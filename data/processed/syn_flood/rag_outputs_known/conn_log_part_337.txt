- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.220.6 on port 11920 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
