- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.194.226 on port 10444 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
