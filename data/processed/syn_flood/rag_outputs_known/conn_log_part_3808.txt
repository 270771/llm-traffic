- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.35.22 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
