- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60367 to 163.21.132.75:18052 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
