- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 initiated 44 TCP SYN packets without completing handshakes to destination 133.250.169.27 on port 11101, resulting in multiple S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 flags) from a single source IP is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and monitor for further suspicious activity.
