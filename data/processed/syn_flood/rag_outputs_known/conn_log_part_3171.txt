- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.101.38 on port 50000 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets (count=1, bytes=44) strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern consistent with known TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server.
