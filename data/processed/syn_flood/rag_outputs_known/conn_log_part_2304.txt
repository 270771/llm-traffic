- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39517 to 203.65.23.219:9797 with SYN packets but no established connection (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN packets without connection completion (S0) indicate potential SYN flood behavior.
