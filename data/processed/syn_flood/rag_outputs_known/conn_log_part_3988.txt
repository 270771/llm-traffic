- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.1.169 on port 1935 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
