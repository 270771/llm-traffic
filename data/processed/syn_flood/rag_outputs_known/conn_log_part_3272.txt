- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.10.67 on port 12316 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the incomplete TCP handshake (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
