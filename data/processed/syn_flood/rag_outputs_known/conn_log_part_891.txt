- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.74.203 on port 12512 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm server resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
