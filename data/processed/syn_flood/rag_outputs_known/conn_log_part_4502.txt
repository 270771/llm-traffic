- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.131.132 on port 21312 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
