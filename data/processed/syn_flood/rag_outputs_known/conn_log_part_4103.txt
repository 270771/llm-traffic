- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.175.153 on port 25565 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (S0 state with many SYNs and no ACKs), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server on port 25565. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
