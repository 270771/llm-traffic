- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.137.235 on port 50000 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (SYN packets without handshake completion).
