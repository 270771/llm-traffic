- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51968 to 163.21.218.170:48002 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
