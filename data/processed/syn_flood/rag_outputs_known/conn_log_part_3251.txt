- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.6.227 on port 9872 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets without completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
