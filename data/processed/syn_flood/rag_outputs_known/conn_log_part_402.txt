- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 203.65.117.130:19105 to 192.103.164.17:636 with RSTO flag and low response time, indicating potential SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 203.65.117.130 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN flood activity but lacks corroborating evidence for definitive action beyond investigation and cautious mitigation.
