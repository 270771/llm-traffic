- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.130.115 on port 18081 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and high SYN count without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion on the target server.
