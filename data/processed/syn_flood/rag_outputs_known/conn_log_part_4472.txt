- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.251.53 on port 9009 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 9009 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood activity due to classic SYN flood signature (many SYNs, no ACKs).
