- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:15188 to 133.118.116.154:3299 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects numerous incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
