- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.55.21 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by the S0 flag (SYN sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag pattern is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.55.21. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further malicious activity.
