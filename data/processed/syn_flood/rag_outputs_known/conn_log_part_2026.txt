- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.106.245 on port 4321 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
