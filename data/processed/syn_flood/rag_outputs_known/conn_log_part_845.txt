- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20565 to 133.250.90.30:12149 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood alert itself shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN packets without completion—consistent with known SYN flood attack patterns.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
