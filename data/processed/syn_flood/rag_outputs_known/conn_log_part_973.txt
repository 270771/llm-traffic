- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.57.67 on port 4369 with SYN packets but no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
