- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.120.230 on port 7777 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are a definitive signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion and maintain service availability.
