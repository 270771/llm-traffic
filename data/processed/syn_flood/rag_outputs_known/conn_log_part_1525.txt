- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:17313 to 133.250.182.173:465 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN packets without handshake completion indicate potential SYN flood behavior.
