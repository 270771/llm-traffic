- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.193.45:60001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection pattern (S0 state with zero established connections) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
