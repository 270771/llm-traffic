- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45038 to 202.44.218.106:9966 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for malicious activity.
