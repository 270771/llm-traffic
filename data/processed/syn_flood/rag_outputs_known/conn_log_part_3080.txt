- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5186 to 133.250.183.254:12570 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
