- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.118.162 on port 32400 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends many SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 32400 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
