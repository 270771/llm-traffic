- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.106.202:3128 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
