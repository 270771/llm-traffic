- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.202.103 on port 8554 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
