- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.116.250 on port 10003 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to classic SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target server.
