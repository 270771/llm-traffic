- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.75.171:37215 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, characterized by numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target host 133.250.75.171 from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
