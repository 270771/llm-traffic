- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.161.16 on port 41800 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood behavior (many SYNs without handshake completion), which is a known threat pattern. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
