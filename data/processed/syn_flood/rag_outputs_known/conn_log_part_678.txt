- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.197.221 on port 22703 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S, count 1, state S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and monitor for increased SYN packet volume; if confirmed as flood, implement rate-limiting or block IP to prevent denial of service.
