- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11953 to 133.118.91.175:32080 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent, 0 connections completed.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
