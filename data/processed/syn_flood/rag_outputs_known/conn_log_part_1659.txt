- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.94.200 on port 16078 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
