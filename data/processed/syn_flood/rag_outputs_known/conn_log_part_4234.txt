- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.94.236 on port 2222 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and maintain service availability.
