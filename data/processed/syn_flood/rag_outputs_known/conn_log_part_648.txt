- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.150.214 on port 49152 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
