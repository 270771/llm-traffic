- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.17.188 on port 8009 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
