- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.175.3 on port 12485 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation to confirm attack scope.
