- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.114.74 on port 2067 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume is high or persistent, as the pattern of SYN without ACK is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
