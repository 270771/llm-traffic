- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56725 to 133.118.217.38:21270 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
