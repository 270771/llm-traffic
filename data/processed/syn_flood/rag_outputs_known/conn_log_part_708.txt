- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.79.128 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target 133.118.79.128 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
