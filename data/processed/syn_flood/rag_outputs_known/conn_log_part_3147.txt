- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.17.128 on port 26 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
