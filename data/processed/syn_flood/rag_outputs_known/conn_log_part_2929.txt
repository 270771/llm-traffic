- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30767 to 203.65.4.128:16058 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
