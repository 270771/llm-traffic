- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.15.208 on port 12512 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect service availability.
