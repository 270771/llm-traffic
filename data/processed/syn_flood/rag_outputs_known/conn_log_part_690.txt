- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24185 to 133.118.3.11:10001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior, consistent with known TCP SYN flood patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
