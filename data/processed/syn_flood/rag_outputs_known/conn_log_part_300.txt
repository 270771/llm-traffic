- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28483 to 163.21.117.69:18100 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
