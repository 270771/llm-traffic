- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:25791 to 133.250.114.117:9550 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
