- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27031 to 202.44.216.135:53480 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
