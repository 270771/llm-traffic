- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.48.70 on port 3749 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
