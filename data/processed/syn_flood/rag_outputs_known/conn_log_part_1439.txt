- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.139.101 on port 9458 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are definitive indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
