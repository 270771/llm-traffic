- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47531 to 202.44.197.29:16094 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
