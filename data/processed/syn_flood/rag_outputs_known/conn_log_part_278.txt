- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23743 to 163.21.61.71:12200 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly correspond to classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.61.71. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
