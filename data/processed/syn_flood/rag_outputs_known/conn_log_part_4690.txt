- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, ending in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics: multiple SYN attempts without handshake completion, resulting in reset responses. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources on port 23 (Telnet). Without anomaly data, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
