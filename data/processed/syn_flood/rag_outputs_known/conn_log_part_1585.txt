- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.59.204 on port 44158 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag with SYN-only packets strongly indicates a SYN flood pattern requiring proactive mitigation.
