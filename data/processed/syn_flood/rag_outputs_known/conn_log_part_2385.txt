- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.24.43 on port 16311 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
