- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.42.105 on port 135 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further malicious activity.
