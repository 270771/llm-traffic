- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26312 to 133.118.44.18:1433 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) to a common database port (1433) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
