- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.115.39 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source IP for potential blocking if attack persists.
