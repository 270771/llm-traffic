- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.165.96 on port 7443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
