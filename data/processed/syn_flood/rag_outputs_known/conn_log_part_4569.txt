- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14991 to 133.118.254.45:16066 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake, which exhausts server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
