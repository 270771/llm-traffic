- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50745 to 202.44.211.188:55200 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 state, 44 SYN packets, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
