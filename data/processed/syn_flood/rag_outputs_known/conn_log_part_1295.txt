  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, and initiate further investigation due to lack of anomaly confirmation but clear SYN flood signature.
