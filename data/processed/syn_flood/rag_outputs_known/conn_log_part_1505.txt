- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65177 to 203.65.9.67:13333 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
