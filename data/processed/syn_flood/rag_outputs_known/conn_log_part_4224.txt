- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.175.26 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
