- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.218.10:82 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
