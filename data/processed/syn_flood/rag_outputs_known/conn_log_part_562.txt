- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23485 to 133.250.134.173:9988 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
