- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.96.11 on port 35000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
