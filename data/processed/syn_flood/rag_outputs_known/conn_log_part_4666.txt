- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.12.73 on port 84 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows SYN packets without completion of the TCP handshake (S0 flag), a classic symptom of SYN flood attacks. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the connection pattern strongly aligns with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
