- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:60463 to 133.118.171.76:16085 shows S0 flag with 1 SYN packet sent, 0 ACKs received, and no session completion, indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag with no handshake completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
