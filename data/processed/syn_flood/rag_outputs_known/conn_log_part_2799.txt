- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.105.195 on port 8009 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks causing resource exhaustion.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from potential denial-of-service impact.
