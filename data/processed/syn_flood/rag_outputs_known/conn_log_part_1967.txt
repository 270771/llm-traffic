- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.221.176 on port 8139 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s pattern (many SYNs without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
