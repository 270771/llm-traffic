- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 167.249.133.167 on port 6565 to destination IP 133.118.170.134 on port 18079 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.170.134:18079 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity, as the pattern of SYN packets without responses is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
