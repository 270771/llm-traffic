  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this event as a ping flood. The alert involves TCP traffic with S0 flags indicating connection attempts without completion, which is inconsistent with ICMP ping flood characteristics.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity; do not treat as ICMP ping flood. Apply rate-limiting or block if confirmed malicious.
