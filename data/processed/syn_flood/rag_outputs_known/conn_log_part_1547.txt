- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:24991 to 203.65.103.154:21298 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN sent and no response), which is a classic sign of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
