- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.122.217 on port 25001 show SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no ACK) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
