- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.120.102 on port 10001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent. Implement rate-limiting on port 10001 to mitigate impact.
