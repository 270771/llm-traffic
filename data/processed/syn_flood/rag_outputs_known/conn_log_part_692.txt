- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.144.62 on port 4949 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
