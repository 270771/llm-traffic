- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38996 to 203.65.79.247:12450 with SYN packets resulting in no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection statistics (1 SYN sent, 0 established) align with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security understanding.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
