- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.121.113 on port 2376 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs with zero completions) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
