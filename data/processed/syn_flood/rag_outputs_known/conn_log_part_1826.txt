- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:59980 to 163.21.212.79:12441 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt.
