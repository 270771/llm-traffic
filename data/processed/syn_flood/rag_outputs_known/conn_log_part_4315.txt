- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:7062 to 203.65.114.187:21321 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S, state S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of a SYN packet without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend rate-limiting incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for repeated attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.
