- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.134.38 on port 3306 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 3306 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
