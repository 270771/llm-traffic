- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36264 to 133.118.205.66:49121 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block if the behavior persists to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
