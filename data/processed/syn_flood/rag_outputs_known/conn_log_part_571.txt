- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5372 to 203.65.43.133:30083 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server, as the observed pattern (S0 flag with SYN count 1 and no ACKs) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
