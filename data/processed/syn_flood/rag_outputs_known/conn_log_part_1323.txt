- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.145.7:32400 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero successful connections) inherently matches known SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
