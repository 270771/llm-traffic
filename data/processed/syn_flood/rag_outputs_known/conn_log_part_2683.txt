- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46993 to 133.118.73.13:46001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert flags (S0, F) and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern by definition—numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
