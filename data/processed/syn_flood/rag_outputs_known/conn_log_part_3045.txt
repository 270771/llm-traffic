- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.66.252 on port 7474 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with many SYNs and zero completions) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
