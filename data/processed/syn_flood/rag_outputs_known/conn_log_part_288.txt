- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34463 to 163.21.150.176:12192 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without completion.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood attack and protect target 163.21.150.176. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
