- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30991 to 203.65.47.237:554 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion overwhelm target resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
