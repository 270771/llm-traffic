- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:65207 to 163.21.247.6:12366 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics by definition.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 163.21.247.6. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
