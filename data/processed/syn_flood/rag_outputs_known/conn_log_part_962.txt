  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate further investigation on this source for potential malicious intent.
