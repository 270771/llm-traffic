- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.46.89 on port 5900 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet flags.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
