  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this alert as a ping flood. The alert shows TCP flags (S0, F) rather than ICMP traffic, which is inconsistent with a classic ICMP ping flood pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious TCP connection attempts and unusual traffic patterns; do not treat as confirmed ping flood without further evidence. Consider monitoring and rate-limiting suspicious TCP traffic.
