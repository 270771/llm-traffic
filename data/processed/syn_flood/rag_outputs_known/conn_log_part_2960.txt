- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 initiated a TCP connection to destination 202.44.241.203 on port 12401 with a single SYN packet and no response (S0 state), indicating a failed handshake attempt consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and monitor for repeated SYN-only connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
