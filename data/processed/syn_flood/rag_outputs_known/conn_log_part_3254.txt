- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.109.69:7989 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 connection attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without responses (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
