- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:7605 to 133.250.150.228:1599 shows S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect target resources.
