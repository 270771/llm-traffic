- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.127.30 on port 5900 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the SYN-only flag pattern and volume suggest SYN flood behavior requiring proactive investigation.)
