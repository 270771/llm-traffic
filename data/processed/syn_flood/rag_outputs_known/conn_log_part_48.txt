- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31400 to 203.65.121.129:14130 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up connection strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
