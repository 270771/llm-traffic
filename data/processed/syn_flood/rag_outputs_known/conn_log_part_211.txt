- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.255.6 on port 16400 with SYN packets sent but no established connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
