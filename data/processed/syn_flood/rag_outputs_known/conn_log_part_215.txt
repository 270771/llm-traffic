- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with 2.98 seconds duration and multiple SYN flags without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
