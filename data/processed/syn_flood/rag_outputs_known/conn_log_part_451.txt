- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 163.21.78.38:6839 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and no established connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 163.21.78.38 for unusual SYN packet patterns and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further analysis.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a single SYN packet with OTH (other) TCP flag and no established connection, which can be indicative of a SYN flood attempt. Without anomaly records or heuristics, confirmation is limited, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting are prudent to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
