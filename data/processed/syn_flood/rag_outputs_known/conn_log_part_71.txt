- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.33.98 on port 6667 with SYN packets sent but no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for repeated incomplete handshakes; if behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
