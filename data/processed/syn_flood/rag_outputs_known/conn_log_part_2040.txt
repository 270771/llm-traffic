- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21549 to 133.250.124.235:44444 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood attacks, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
