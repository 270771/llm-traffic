- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.21.107 on port 18050 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attempt, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect server availability.
