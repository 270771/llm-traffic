- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9098 to 203.65.53.108:16091 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (44 SYNs with zero completions) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
