- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 163.21.246.117:8443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 163.21.246.117:8443 from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
