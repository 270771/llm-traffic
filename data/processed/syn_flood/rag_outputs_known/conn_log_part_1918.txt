- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.252.233 on port 111 with SYN flag set but no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 0 ACK) align with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
