- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.19.170 on port 2762 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
