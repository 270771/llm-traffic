- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9765 to 203.65.66.228:12169 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 state, SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics known in cybersecurity.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
