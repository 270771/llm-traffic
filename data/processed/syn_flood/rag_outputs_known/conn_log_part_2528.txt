- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.116.240 on port 1521 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.116.240 on port 1521 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If persistent, block the source IP to protect the target server.
