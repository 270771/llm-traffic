- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.220.208 on port 48012 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and the pattern of SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, as they represent numerous half-open TCP connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to mitigate impact.
