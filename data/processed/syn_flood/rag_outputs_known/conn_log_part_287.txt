- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:55474 to 163.21.62.177:40001 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, where SYN requests are sent without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
