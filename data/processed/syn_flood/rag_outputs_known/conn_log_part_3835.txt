- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6380 to 133.250.173.243:9257 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
