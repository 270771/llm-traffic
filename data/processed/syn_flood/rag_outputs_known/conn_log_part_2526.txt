- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23289 to 133.118.68.168:60099 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack volume persists.
