- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.201.170 on port 3388 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 state with SYN flag and no completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
