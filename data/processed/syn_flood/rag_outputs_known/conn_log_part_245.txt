- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.98.90 on port 3388 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with multiple SYNs and no ACKs) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
