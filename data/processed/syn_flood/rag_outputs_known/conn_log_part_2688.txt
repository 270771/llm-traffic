- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.210.141 on port 195 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN flag and no ACK) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
