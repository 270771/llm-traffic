- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:24105 to 202.152.172.131:21324 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
