- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.192.207 on port 11211 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for repeated SYN flood patterns, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks targeting port 11211 (commonly associated with Memcached amplification).
