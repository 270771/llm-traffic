- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.39.33 on port 2480, showing multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall and initiate network monitoring for further SYN flood activity from this source.

**Explanation:** Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior—numerous SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake (S0 flag). This pattern is a well-known denial-of-service technique that exhausts server resources. Blocking the source IP is the most effective immediate mitigation.
