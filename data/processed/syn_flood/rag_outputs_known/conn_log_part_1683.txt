- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.36.10 on port 9515 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the connection pattern (S0 flag, many SYNs, zero completions) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
