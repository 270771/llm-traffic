- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61539 to 163.21.142.108:12382 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 connections established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
