- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.114.133 on ports 11983 → 12228 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and immediate REJ (reject) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with zero completions and REJ responses is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
