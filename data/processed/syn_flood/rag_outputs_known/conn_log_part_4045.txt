- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20270 to 163.21.202.87:3306 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to protect the MySQL service on port 3306 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
