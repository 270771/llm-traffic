- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53114 to 133.118.237.177:21316 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
