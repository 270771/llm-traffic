- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.223 on port 548 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior (high connection attempts, zero completions, and REJ flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.223 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement temporary blocking if traffic persists.
