- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.167.83 on port 2222 showing SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous half-open SYN connections (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 2222 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
