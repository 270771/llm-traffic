- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60418 to 203.65.81.159:12157 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood heuristics documented in standard cybersecurity practice, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server 203.65.81.159 from resource exhaustion. Initiate monitoring for additional suspicious traffic from this source.
