- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.207.136 on port 21252 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection, consistent with SYN flood behavior. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to fully confirm, the connection state (S0) and SYN flag usage indicate a likely SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
