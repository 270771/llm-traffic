- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.170.74:2086 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
