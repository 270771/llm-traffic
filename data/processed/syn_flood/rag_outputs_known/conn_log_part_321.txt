- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39010 to 203.65.90.124:44400 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and 44 SYN packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
