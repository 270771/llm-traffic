- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the alert’s characteristics—multiple SYN packets without completion—are definitive indicators of a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Blocking the source IP is the necessary immediate response.
