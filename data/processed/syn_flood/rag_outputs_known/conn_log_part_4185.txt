- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.46.204 on port 1099 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no handshake completion). Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the behavior itself is consistent with SYN flood characteristics. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
