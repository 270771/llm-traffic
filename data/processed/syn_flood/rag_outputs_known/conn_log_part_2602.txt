- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.107.166 on port 12358 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no connection established). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing the handshake. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
