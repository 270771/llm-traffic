- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.167.241 on port 12111 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), which is a known denial-of-service technique disrupting service availability.
