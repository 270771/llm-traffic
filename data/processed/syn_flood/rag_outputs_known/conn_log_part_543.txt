- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51871 to 133.118.55.32:12112 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to protect the target server.
