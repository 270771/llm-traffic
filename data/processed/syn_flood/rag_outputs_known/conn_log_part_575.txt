- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.37.36 on port 4040 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
