- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and presence of RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion on port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the Telnet service.
