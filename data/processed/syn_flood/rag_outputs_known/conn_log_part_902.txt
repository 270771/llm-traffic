- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.116.167 on port 195 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
