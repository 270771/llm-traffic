- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.77.154 on port 1599 show SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no ACK response) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
