- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting destination 203.65.113.54 on port 444 with TCP protocol shows repeated connection attempts resulting in REJ (reject) responses and a high count of SYN packets (44 SYNs, 40 total attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets with connection rejections strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
