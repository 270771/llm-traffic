- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 203.65.109.43 on port 5172, characterized by multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
