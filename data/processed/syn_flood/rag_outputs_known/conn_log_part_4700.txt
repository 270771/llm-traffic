- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:23183 to 163.21.176.125:35000 show multiple SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
