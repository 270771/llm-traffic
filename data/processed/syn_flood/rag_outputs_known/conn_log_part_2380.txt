- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.180.123 on port 10022 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
