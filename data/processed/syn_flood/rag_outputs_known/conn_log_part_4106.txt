- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31231 to 133.250.70.138:6697 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
