- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39171 to 133.250.136.31:12476 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target 133.250.136.31.
