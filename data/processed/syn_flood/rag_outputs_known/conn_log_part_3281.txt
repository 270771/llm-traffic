- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.134.48 on ports 19390 → 14084 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
