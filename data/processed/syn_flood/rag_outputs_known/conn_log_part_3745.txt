- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 sent 1604 TCP SYN packets to destination 133.118.5.54 on port 1604, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
