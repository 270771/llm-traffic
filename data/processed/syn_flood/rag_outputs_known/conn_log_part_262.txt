- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53793 to 133.118.35.148:13380 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero completions) align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
