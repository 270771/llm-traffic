- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4217 to 133.118.145.31:16055 with SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, causing resource exhaustion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
