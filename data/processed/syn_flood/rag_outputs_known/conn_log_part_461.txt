- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:35453 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN packets with no established connections and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with resets on port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting a vulnerable service. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect the Telnet service.
