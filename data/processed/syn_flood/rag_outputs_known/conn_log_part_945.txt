- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51338 to 163.21.217.111:21317 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the high volume of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
