- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.127.180:49152 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
