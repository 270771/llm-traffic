- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:43246 to 203.65.106.75:17776 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received, connection not established) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
