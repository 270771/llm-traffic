- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.69.136:5601 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
