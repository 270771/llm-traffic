- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 42.60.126.198:49511 to 163.21.148.140:2376 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without handshake completion strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 42.60.126.198 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
