- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.45.255 on port 48019 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target, as the observed SYN-only connection attempts are consistent with SYN flood attack behavior. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
