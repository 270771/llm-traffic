- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:46444 to 133.250.118.240:16009 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or established connections (S0 state, 44 SYNs sent, 0 connections established).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target server.
