- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:19321 to 202.44.223.204:18011 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no ACK) are textbook indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 18011 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
