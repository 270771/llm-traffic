- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60882 to 133.118.230.66:47989 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection failure count (44 attempts, 0 completions) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target 133.118.230.66. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
