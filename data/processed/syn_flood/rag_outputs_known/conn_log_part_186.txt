- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30139 to 133.250.136.225:2181 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag with SYN packets and zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood heuristics—numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.136.225 port 2181 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
