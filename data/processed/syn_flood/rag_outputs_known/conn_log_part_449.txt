- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.210.221 on port 9900 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no completions) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
