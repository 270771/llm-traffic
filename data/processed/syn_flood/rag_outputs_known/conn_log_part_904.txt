- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58593 to 163.21.169.69:16019 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts, 0 established) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
