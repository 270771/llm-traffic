- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46175 to 133.118.178.18:10028 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
