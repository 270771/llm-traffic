- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.116.19 on port 10181 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attempts, justifying proactive investigation and mitigation.
