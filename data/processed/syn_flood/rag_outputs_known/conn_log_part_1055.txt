- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41308 to 133.250.191.169:16080 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, 1 SYN sent, 0 established connections) align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
