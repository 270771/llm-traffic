- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48176 to 202.44.203.57:10243 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
