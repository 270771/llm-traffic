- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.218.152:7989 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completion.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
