- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.127.197 on port 8123 show repeated SYN packets with zero successful completions, resulting in connection rejections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no completions and connection rejections is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
