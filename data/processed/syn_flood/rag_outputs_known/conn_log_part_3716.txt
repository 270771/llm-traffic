- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.172.144 on port 8181 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
