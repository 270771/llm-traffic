- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.197.123 on port 44158 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for unusual SYN packet patterns and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further analysis.

Explanation: Although no anomaly records or heuristics are available to definitively confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediate blocking is premature without corroborating data, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting will mitigate potential risk.
