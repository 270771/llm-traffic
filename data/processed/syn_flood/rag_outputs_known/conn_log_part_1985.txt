- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.202.26 on port 12253 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets with zero established connections are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
