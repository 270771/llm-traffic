- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33747 to 163.21.214.236:9214 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern (many SYNs without ACKs) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
