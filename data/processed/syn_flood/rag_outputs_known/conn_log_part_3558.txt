- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.142.114 on port 8443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous SYN requests without completion.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
