- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18639 to 203.65.46.200:2455 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
