- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.31.115:3689 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed TCP flags and connection pattern (SYN sent, no response) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
