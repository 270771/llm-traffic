- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.17.142 on port 17775 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK or established connection (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with a single SYN and no completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
