- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:38830 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect Telnet service.
