- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.195.156 on port 44304 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet flags (SYN only, no ACK).  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
