- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.182.164 on port 1471 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
