- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63753 to 163.21.168.1:58378 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
