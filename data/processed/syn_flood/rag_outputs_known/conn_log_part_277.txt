- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65490 to 133.250.114.160:12351 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly record or heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without ACKs) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
