- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59401 to 133.118.173.242:50003 with SYN flag set, no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
