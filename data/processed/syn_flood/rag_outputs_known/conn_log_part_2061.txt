- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:18776 to 202.44.250.174:12342 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the presence of a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or response (S0 state) indicates a half-open connection typical of SYN flood attacks. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
