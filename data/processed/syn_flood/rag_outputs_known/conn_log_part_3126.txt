- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3243 to 163.21.255.42:20053 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server 163.21.255.42. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
