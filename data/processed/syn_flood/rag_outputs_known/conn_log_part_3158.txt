- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.97.76 on port 10250 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, no completions).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further threat intelligence.
