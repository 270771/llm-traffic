- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11018 to 202.44.217.164:18888 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
