- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30991 to 203.65.39.228:554 showing S0 flag with 1 attempt and 44 bytes transferred, indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.39.228:554 and monitor for further SYN flood patterns, as the S0 flag with minimal handshake completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt disrupting service availability.
