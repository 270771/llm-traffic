- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.209.54 on port 17779 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block if the behavior persists to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
