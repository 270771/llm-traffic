- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:24950 to 203.65.52.104:12270 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
