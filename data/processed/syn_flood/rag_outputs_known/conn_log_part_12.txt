- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5450 to 163.21.124.192:21267 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple packets and zero established connections strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
