- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.165.79 on port 3389 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 3389 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the RDP service.
