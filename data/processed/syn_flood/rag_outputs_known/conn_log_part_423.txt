- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45397 to 163.21.55.90:21243 with SYN flag set, no response, and connection state S0 (SYN sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the connection state S0 with SYN flag and no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attempts, warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
