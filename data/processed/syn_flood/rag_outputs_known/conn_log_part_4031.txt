- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.248.181 on port 46000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard network security heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
