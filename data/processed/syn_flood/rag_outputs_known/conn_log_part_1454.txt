- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39931 to 163.21.29.52:16043 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.29.52. Initiate further investigation on source behavior.
