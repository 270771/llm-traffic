- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59379 to 133.118.116.20:9202 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
