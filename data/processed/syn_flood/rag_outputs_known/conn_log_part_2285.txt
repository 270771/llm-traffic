- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.200.174 on port 30003 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
