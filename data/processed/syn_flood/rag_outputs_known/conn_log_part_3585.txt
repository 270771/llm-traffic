- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:11284 to 133.118.95.246:135 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (SYN sent, no ACK received).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.95.246 port 135. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
