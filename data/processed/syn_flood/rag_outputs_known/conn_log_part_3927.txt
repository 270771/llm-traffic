- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.26.45 on port 9800 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
