- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.242.19:7657 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
