- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.113.192 on port 51235 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag pattern strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt.
