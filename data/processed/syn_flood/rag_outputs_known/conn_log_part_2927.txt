- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.187.139 on port 2761 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
