- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20030 to 133.118.226.186:30021 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows multiple SYN attempts without completion (S0), a classic indicator of a SYN flood. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
