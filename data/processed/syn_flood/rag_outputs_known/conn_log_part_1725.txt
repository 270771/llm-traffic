- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.121.219:7777 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
