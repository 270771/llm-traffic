- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.168.246 on port 9376, characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s signature (S0 flag with multiple SYN attempts and zero completions) is a classic and definitive indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server’s resources.
