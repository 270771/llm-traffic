- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.100.51 on port 7548 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the observed behavior (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity literature.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
