- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:33488 to 133.118.214.238:16071 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly. However, the observed behavior (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
