- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with a high connection attempt rate (2.93 seconds interval).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the rapid SYN attempts to port 23 (commonly Telnet) are suspicious and warrant proactive investigation.
