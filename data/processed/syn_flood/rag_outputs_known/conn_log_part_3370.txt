- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.93.209 on ports 30074 → 21248 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, many SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood attack patterns documented in cybersecurity practice.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
