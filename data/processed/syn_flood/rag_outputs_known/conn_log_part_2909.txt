- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20969 to 163.21.102.38:50006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 0 connections completed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
