- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:35341 to 163.21.101.193:10480 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
