- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52139 to 163.21.219.111:12466 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets (44) with no corresponding ACKs or connection completions (S0 state). Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, this behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics: overwhelming a target with SYN requests without completing handshakes. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
