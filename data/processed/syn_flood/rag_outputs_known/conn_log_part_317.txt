- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.87.149 on port 80 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no handshake completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
