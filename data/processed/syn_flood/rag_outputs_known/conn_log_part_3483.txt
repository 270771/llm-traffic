- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 on port 24770 targeting 133.118.166.0 port 12400, characterized by numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature is evident from the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP handshakes.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the attack and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
