- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.182.102 on port 12291 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK received). This behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
