- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59665 to 133.118.18.29:35560 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 133.118.18.29 from resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
