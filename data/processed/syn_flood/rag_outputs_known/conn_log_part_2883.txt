- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.165.254 on port 5577 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no response, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior aimed at exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
