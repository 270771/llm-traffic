- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22336 to 133.118.43.244:16004 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
