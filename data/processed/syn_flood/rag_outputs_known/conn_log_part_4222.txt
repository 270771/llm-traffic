- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27087 to 203.65.52.30:18001 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume is high, as the S0 state indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
