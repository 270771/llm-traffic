- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.206.71 on port 19013 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK or completion, indicating a half-open connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous half-open TCP connections (S0) with SYN flags and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
