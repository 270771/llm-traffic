- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 (source port 30705) to 133.118.186.158 (destination port 2000) show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 2000 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
