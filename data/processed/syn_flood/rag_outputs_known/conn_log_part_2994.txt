- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for potential malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—multiple SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake (indicated by flags and counts). Port 23 (Telnet) is a common target for exploitation, increasing risk. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
