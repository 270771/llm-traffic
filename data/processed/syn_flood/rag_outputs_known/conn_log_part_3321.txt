- SYN flood alert: Connection from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.85.45 on port 8090 shows TCP flag S0 with 44 attempts and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
