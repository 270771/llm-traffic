- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:27723 to 133.118.148.103:102 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, zero successful connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
