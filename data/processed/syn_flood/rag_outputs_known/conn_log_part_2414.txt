- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.108.97 on port 12200 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security understanding.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
