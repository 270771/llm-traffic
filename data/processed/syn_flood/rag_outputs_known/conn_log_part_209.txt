- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:2126 to 133.250.148.116:18009 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag, many SYNs without ACKs) is a well-known and reliable indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target system. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
