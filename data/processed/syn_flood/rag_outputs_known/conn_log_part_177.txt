- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.207.134 on port 9761 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of such packets (44) strongly align with known SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
