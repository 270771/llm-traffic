- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.133.159 on port 1521 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating many TCP handshakes without completing them.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 1521 to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain service availability. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further malicious activity.
