- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.79.208 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature despite lack of anomaly data.
