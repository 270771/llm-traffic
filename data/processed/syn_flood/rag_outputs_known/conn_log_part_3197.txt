- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38607 to 203.65.81.225:12235 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high count of such attempts (44) strongly align with known SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect target 203.65.81.225 from resource exhaustion.
