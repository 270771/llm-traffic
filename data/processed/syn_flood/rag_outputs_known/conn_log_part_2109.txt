- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 163.21.236.202:17000 shows S0 flag with 1 attempt and 44 packets, indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Without anomaly data or heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag with multiple packets and no handshake completion strongly indicates SYN flood behavior.
