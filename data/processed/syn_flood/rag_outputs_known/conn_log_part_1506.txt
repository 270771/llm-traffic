- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 203.65.125.89:9443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 bytes, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, consistent with SYN flood attack patterns.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
