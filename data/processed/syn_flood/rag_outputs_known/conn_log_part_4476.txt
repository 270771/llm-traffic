- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30929 to 133.118.185.217:17780 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of a single SYN packet with no handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
