- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48617 to 133.118.43.250:16073 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
