- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.210.9 on port 5577 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
