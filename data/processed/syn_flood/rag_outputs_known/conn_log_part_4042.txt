- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.119.41 on port 31001 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous half-open connections (S0 state) with SYN flags and no completion.
