- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.255.244:9200 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
