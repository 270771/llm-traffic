- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.218.211 on port 16993 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
