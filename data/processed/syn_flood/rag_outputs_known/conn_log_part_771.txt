- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:12420 to 133.250.150.31:6653 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag indicates numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, a classic signature of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
