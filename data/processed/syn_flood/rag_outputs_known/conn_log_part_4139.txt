- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.63.38 on port 26 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
