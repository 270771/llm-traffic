- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:55990 to 133.250.148.20:18071 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
