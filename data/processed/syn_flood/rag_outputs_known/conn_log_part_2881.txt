- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.97.146 on port 444 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero data transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with numerous SYN packets and no established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
