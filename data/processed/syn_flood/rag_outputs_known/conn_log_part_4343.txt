- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61771 to 133.250.190.119:21325 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics known in cybersecurity.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
