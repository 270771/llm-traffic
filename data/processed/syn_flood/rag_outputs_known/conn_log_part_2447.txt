- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10192 to 133.118.175.111:16051 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, multiple SYNs without ACKs) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
