- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.59.36 on port 12391 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 state means SYN sent but no ACK received), which is a classic sign of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. The recommended action is to proactively investigate and apply mitigations if attack behavior persists.
