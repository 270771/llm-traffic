- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.152.164 on port 1025 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, zero completions) align with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
