- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14394 to 202.44.238.96:23084 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous half-open connections (S0 state) causing resource exhaustion.
