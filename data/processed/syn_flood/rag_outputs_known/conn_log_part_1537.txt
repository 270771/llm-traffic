- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.196.220 on port 9100 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
