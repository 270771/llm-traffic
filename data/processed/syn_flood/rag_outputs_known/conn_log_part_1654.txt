- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.82.210 on port 2222 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
