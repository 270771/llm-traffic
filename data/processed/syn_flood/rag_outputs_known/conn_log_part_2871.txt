- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:64799 to 133.250.125.29:12396 shows SYN packets with no established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
