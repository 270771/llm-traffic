- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64138 to 202.44.243.234:18083 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 attempt, 44 bytes sent).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
