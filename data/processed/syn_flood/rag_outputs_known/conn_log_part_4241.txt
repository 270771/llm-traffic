- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.231.224 on port 7443 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with SYN packets and zero completions is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
