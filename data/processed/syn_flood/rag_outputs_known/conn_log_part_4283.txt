- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.99.175 on port 9944 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
