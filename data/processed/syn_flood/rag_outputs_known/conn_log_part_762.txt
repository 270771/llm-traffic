- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.43.145 on port 8200 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8200 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
