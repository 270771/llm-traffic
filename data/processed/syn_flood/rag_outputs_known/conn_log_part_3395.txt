- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.184.131 on ports 18190 → 12084 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating many half-open connections.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
