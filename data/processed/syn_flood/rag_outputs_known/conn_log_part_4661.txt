- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4522 to 133.250.97.30:50012 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly aligns with classic SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.97.30.
