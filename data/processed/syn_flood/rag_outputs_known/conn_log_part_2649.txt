- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.89.158 on port 8889 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, indicating a half-open connection (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple half-open SYN connections (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
