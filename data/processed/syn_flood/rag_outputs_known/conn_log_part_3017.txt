- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.65.47 on port 1099 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection pattern (S0 state, many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
