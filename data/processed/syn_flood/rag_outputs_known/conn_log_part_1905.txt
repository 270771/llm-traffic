- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.175.140 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK received).
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
