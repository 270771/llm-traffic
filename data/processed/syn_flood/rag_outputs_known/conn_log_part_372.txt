- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44559 to 163.21.24.230:12218 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, SYN-only, no response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
