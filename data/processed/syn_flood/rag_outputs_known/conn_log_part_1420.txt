- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18539 to 133.118.187.140:102 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
