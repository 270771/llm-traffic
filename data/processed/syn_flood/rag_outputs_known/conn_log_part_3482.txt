- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22685 to 163.21.195.80:9300 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 163.21.195.80:9300 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
