- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.173.231 on port 54138 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further for potential attack sources.
