- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.179.144 on port 9151 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN, no ACK) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections intended to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for repeated attempts. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
