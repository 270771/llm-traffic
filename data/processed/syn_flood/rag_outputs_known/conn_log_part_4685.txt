- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52715 to 163.21.55.236:21298 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
