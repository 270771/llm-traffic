- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.76.202 on port 8605 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
