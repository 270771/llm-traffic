- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65163 to 133.118.171.229:9919 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
