- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.193.131 on port 84 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by the S0 flag and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a definitive indicator of a SYN flood attack.
