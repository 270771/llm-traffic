- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.123.129 on port 179 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet count with zero completions are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
