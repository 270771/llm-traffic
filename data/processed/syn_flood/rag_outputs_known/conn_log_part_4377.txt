- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the presence of repeated SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake (indicated by flags and counts) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 107.81.9.228 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion on the target server and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
