- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20131 to 163.21.8.128:25 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) to port 25 (SMTP) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect mail server availability.
