- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19330 to 133.250.144.107:2761 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
