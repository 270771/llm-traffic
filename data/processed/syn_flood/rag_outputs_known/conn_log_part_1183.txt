- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64478 to 133.250.109.232:12473 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with no handshake completion) aligns with standard SYN flood detection heuristics, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the TCP handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
