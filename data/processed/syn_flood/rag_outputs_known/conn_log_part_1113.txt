- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64659 to 133.118.124.17:55080 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert flags (S0, F flags, zero established connections) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent numerous SYN requests without completing the TCP handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
