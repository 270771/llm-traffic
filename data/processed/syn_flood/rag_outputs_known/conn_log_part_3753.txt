- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.232.167 on port 12175 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP SYN packet sent (S flag) with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to confirm, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting or blocking of the source IP is warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
