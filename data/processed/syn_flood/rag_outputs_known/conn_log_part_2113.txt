- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.85.250 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
