- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.110.137 on port 5432 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server on port 5432.
