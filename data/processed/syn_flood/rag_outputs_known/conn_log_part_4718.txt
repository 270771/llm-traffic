- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.219.109 on port 18084 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood behavior (many SYNs without completion), justifying investigation and mitigation steps.
