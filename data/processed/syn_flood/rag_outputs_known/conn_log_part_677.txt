- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.83.4 on port 83 show a pattern of SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S0, count 1, 44 bytes).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.
