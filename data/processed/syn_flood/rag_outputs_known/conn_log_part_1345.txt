- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 203.65.119.29 on port 9219, characterized by a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system, as the observed pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
