- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.91.150 on port 2379 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
