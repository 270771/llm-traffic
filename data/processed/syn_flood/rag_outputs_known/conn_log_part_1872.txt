- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.127.134 on port 20001 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood behavior by definition.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server’s resources.
