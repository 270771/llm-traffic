- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.69.5 on port 29840 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a well-known denial-of-service technique.
