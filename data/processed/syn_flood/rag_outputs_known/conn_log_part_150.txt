- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.142.134 on ports 28124 → 12268 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood attempt (S0 state with SYN sent but no response), which is a classic sign of SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
