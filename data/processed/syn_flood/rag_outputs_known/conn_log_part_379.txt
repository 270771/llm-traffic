- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 47.41.151.4 to 163.21.148.140 on port 23 with 4 connection attempts in 4.56 seconds, all resulting in no successful handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 47.41.151.4 to prevent potential resource exhaustion on port 23, as repeated SYN packets without handshake completion strongly indicate a SYN flood attack. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
