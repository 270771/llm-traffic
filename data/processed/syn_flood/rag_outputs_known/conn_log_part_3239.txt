- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.130.131 on port 9804 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
