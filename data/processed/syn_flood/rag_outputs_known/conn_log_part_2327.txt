- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23668 to 133.118.217.124:5577 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristics, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
