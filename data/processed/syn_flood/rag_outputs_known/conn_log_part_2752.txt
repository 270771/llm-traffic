- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.188.229 on port 80 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential malicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to port 80 to mitigate possible SYN flood impact.
