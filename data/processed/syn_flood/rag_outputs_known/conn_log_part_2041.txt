- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.183.20 on port 1471 with many incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake (S0 state), indicating a denial-of-service attempt.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
