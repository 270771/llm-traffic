- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11793 to 163.21.131.38:12103 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
