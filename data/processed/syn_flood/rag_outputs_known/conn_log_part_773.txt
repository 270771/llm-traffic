- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38585 to 163.21.112.110:25002 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple incomplete connections strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
