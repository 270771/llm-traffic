- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19721 to 133.118.143.200:20256 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP SYN packet with S0 flag, indicating a SYN sent without a response, a classic sign of SYN flood behavior. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the presence of S0 flags and repeated SYN attempts is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
