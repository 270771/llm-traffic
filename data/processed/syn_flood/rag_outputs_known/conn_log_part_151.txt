- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.130.168 on port 20182 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target.
