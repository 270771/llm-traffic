- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:20131 to 133.118.157.178:587 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
