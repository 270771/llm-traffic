- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35568 to 133.250.71.92:31210 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating connections without completing them.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
