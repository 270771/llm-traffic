- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.183.222 on port 2761 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
