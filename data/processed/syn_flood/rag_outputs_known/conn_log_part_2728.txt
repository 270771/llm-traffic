- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 92.199.253.203 to 203.65.103.15 on port 43389 show repeated SYN packets with zero successful connections and multiple TCP resets (REJ), indicating connection refusal.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no successful handshakes and TCP resets is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 92.199.253.203 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
