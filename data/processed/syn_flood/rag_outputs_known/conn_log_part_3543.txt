- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 203.65.91.75 to 192.103.164.17 on port 636 shows characteristics of a SYN flood (high SYN count, OTH flag indicating incomplete handshakes).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed incomplete TCP handshakes and SYN flood signature justify immediate rate-limiting on source IP 203.65.91.75 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Further investigation recommended to confirm intent.
