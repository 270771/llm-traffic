- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.84.62 on port 12601 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
