- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.174.213 on port 10093 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
