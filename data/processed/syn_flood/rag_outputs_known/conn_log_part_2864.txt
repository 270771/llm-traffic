- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19222 to 133.118.97.58:1025 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets with zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
