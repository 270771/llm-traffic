- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.195.216 on port 1911 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed S0 flag with multiple SYNs and zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
