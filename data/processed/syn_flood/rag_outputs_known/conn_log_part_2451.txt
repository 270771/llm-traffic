- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.172.197 on port 2087 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
