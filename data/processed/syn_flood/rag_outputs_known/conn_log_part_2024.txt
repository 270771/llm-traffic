- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.130.35 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect target 163.21.130.35. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
