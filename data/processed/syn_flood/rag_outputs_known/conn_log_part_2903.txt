- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:4006 to 133.118.185.246:6001 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
