- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35187 to 133.118.240.224:12526 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
