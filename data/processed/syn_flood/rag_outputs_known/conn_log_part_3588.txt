- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.230.244 on port 81 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
