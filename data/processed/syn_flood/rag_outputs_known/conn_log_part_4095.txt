- SYN flood alert: Cr0blp3noLkeFShtsk from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.89.56 on TCP port 14147 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
