- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.129.78 on port 4730 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
