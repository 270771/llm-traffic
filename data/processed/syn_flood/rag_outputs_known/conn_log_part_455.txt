- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.157.193 on port 21308 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; consider blocking if attack persists.
