- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential resource exhaustion on port 23 (Telnet), as the pattern of repeated SYN flags without ACKs strongly indicates a SYN flood attack.
