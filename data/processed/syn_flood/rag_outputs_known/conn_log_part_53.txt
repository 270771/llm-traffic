- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.17.192 on port 18079 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
