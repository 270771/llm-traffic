- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36239 to 163.21.150.159:12227 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
