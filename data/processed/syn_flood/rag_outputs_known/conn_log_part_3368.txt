- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.145.222 on port 23424 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
