- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.144.174 on port 5858 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
