  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows characteristics typical of a SYN flood attack—high volume of SYN packets targeting port 23 (Telnet), which is a common attack vector. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
