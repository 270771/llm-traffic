- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.21.46 on port 8001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, and initiate investigation on this source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristics, the presence of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, warranting proactive mitigation.
