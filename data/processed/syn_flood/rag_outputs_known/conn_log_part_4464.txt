- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.14.42 on port 12337 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or response) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated attempts; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
