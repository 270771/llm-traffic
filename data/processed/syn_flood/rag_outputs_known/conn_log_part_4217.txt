- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52130 to 163.21.155.163:38520 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 state, 1 SYN packet, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
