- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.69.65 on port 8800 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP threat models.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and block if the behavior persists to mitigate the SYN flood impact.
