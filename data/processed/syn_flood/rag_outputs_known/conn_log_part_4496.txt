- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.3.166 on port 4911 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
