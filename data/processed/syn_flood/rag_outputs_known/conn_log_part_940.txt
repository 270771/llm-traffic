- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.70.230 on port 52951 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
