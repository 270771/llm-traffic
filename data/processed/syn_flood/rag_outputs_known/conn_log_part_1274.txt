- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.73.147 on port 1471 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets (44 attempts) strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern consistent with known TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
