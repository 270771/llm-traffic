- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.95.191 on port 9999 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 44 attempts, 1 SYN sent, 0 established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as the high volume of incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack despite lack of anomaly metadata.
