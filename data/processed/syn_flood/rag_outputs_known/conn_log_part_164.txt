- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.163.126 on port 13001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by resource exhaustion attempts.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate further investigation on this IP for malicious activity.
