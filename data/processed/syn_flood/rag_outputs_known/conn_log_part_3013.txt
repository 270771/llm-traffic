- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:22369 to 133.250.71.11:6379 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN attempts strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target service on port 6379.
