- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6577 to 133.250.81.238:12113 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
