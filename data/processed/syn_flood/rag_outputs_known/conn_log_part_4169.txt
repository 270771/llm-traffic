- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.187.77 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK, indicating incomplete handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm if this is a SYN flood attack, as the incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) strongly indicate SYN flood behavior despite lack of anomaly records.
