- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:12991 to 163.21.246.41:12220 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
