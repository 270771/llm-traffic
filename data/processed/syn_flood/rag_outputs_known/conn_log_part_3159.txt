- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3868 to 133.250.99.211:21324 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 bytes, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
