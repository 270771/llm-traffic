- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:3901 to 133.118.173.238:45333 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN flag and no ACK) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
