- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.246.116 on port 18076 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
