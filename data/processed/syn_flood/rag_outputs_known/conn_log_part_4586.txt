- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.177.122:8080 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
