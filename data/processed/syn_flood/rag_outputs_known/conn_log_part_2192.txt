- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35267 to 133.118.115.9:20900 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without any established connections (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.115.9. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
