- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63073 to 163.21.39.134:9383 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood behavior, characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
