- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4268 to 133.118.93.123:16095 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual SYN traffic patterns and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further analysis.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristics are provided, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with a single SYN packet and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediate blocking is premature without corroborating data, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting will mitigate potential impact.
