- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:57527 to 202.152.173.202:23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses and a high SYN rate (0.696731).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion and RST responses on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
