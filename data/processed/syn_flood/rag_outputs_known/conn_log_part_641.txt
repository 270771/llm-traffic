- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40847 to 202.44.209.88:9998 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response, indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with zero established connections and only SYN packets strongly aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where the attacker sends SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect server availability.
