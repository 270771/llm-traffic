- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.88.61 on port 10001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
