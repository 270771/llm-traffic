- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 46.5.12.59:50847 to 163.21.148.140:21022 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 46.5.12.59 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
