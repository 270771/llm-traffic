- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23326 to 202.44.254.56:9280 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no ACKs) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
