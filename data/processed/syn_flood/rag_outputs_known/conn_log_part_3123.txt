- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.250.152 on port 7443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security heuristics.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
