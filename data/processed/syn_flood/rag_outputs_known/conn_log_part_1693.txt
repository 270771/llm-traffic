- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:18993 to 133.250.138.62:37443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection, a classic sign of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent resource exhaustion.
