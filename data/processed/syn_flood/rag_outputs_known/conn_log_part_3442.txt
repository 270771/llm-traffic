- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.67.226:3689 shows S0 flag with 44 connection attempts and zero completions, indicating SYN packets sent without completing handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior due to clear pattern of incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood attack.
