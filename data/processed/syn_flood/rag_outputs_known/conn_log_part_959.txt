- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.45.150 on port 5555 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.45.150:5555 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If traffic persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
