- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.35.27 on port 1471 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN only) indicates a potential denial-of-service attempt.
