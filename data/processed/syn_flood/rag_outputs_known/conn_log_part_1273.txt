- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45023 to 133.250.107.148:12566 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood characteristics (SYN packets without completion), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
