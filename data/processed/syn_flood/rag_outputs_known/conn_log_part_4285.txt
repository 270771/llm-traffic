- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.78.227 on port 4730 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (connection attempt sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 flags typically indicate SYN flood behavior despite lack of anomaly data.
