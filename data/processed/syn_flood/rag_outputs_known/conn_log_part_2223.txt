- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.23.78 with SYN flag set and no corresponding ACK or established connection (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
