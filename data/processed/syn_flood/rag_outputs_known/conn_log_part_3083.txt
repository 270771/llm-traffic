- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.232.254 on port 15 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and repeated failed connection attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
