- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.8.14 on port 48020 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.8.14. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
