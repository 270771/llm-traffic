- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.74.109 on port 2332 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
