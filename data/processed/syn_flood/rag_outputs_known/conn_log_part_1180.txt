- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.17.168 on port 12361 shows a SYN flood pattern with 44 SYN packets sent, 0 established connections, and 0 retransmissions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system.
