- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:51709 to 133.118.33.43:21324 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—multiple SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
