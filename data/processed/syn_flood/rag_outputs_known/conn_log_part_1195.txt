- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:21491 to 163.21.97.218:8087 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
