- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.95.161 on port 8649 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection attempt consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the single SYN with no handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
