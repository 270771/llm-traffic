- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45798 to 163.21.189.170:57786 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero completions strongly aligns with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
