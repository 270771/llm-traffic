- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate this detection.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior targeting a known service port (23 - Telnet), which is commonly exploited. Follow up with network traffic monitoring to confirm attack cessation.
