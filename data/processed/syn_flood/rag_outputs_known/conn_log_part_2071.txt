- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41367 to 163.21.230.227:50022 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 connections established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If traffic persists, block IP to prevent denial of service.
