- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.105.170 on port 12322 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks and poses a denial-of-service threat.
