- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 203.65.104.45:2067 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further SYN flood behavior. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
