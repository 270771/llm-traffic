- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.95.204 on port 8112 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.95.204, as the pattern of SYN without handshake completion is a definitive indicator of a SYN flood attack. Investigate source IP for further malicious activity.
