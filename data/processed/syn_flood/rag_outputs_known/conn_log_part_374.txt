- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.18.201 on port 6668 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
