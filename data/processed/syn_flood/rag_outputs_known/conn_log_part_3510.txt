- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:27689 to 133.118.65.43:9600 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
