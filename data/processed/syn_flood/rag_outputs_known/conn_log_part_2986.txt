- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.219.185 on port 5900 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of SYNs without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
