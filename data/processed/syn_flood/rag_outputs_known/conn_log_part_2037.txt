- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.6.7 on port 12360 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without handshake completion, overwhelming target resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
