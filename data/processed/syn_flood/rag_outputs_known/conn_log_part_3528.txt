- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31963 to 133.118.142.214:24472 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACK or connection establishment (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
