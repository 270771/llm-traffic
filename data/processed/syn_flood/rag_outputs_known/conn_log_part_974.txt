- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.19.142 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system from resource exhaustion. Further investigation of the source IP is recommended.
