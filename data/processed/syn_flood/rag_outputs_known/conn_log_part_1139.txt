- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.159.81:3542 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without connection completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target 133.118.159.81.
