- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:8102 to 133.118.38.171:30002 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs or established sessions (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly record found; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts indicating half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
