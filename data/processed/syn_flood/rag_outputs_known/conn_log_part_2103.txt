- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 202.44.239.1 on port 666, characterized by a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the incomplete handshake pattern (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources.
