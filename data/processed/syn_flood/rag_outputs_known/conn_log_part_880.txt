- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.3.209 on port 12358 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
