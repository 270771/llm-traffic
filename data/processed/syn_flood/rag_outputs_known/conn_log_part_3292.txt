- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38308 to 163.21.239.67:31380 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response strongly align with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target host.
