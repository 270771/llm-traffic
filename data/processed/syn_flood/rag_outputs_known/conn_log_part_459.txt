- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.246.225:55442 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
