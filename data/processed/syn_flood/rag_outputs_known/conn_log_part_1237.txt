- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20336 to 133.250.147.191:11443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
