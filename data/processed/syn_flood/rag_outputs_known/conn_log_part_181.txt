- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.119.174 on port 12137 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
