- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11472 to 133.118.180.2:18047 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
