- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 39.83.213.232:46274 to 203.65.103.15:6379 show repeated SYN packets with zero successful completions and immediate rejections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 39.83.213.232 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly records or heuristics are provided, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with zero completions and immediate rejections strongly aligns with SYN flood behavior. Immediate action to investigate and mitigate is warranted.
