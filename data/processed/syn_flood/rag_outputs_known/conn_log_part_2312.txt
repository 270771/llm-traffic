- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:12823 to 133.250.115.152:12370 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of a SYN packet without any established connection (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
