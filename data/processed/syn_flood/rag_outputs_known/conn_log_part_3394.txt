- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.236.120 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in S0 (connection attempt seen, no reply) state.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag and absence of connection completion strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further for potential coordinated attack.
