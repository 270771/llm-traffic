- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:61875 to 163.21.81.154:9292 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 163.21.81.154:9292 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
