- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58418 to 133.250.101.80:12545 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, single SYN packet, no ACKs) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
