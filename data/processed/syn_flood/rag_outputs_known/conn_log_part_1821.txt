- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41334 to 133.250.96.127:50102 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state), a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to confirm, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood patterns where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting or blocking of the source IP is warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
