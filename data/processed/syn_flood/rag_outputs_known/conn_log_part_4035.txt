- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.64.70 on port 8060 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and multiple retransmissions, resulting in REJ (rejections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8060 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity due to observed connection failures and retransmissions consistent with SYN flood behavior.
