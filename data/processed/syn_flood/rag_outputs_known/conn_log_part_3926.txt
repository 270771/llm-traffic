- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.249.149 on port 8126 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
