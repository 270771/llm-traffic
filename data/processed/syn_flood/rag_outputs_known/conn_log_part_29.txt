- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:22601 to 133.250.82.131:4786 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
