- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 on port 20181 targeting 203.65.50.10:18333 shows TCP flags indicating SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation; consider blocking if attack persists.
