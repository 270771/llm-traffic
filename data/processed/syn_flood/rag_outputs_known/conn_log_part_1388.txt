- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.233.131 on port 12187 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated connection attempts to prevent resource exhaustion. Further investigation of this source IP is required due to the suspicious half-open connection pattern consistent with SYN flood attacks.
