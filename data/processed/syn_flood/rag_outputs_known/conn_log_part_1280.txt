- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.183.151 on port 8880 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts; implement rate-limiting on port 8880 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
