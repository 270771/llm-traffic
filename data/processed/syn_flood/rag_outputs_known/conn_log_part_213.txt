- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.58.105 on port 12464 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
