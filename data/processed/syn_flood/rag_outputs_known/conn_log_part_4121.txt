- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20131 to 133.250.98.215:25 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without ACKs overwhelm target resources.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
