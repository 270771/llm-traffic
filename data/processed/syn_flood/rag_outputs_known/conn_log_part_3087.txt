- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.42.239 on port 8009 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
