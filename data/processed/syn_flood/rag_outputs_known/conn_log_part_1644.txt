- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36137 to 202.44.204.150:50050 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly correspond to classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
