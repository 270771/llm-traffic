- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.50.229 on port 9151 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
