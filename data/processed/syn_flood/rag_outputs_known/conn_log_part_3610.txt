- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20270 to 203.65.68.112:3306 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the MySQL service on port 3306.
