- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35579 to 133.118.164.74:14006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.164.74. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
