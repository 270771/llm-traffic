- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.45.150 on port 4443 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard cybersecurity practice.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
