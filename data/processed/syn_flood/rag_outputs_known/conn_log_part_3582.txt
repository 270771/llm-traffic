- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.85.171 on port 14024 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet without response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
