- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.111.54 on port 9160 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further network logs for related activity.
