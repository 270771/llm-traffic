- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.96.205 on port 20000 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN-only connection attempts with zero completions strongly align with SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
