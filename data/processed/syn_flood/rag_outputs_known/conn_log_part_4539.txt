- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16139 to 133.250.182.252:22000 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
