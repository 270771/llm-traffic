- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36324 to 133.118.78.88:50007 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN flags with zero ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
