- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.252.221 on port 1599 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
