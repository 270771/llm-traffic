- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.101.63 on port 771 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag pattern is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.101.63 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
