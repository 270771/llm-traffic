- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39649 to 163.21.252.151:50160 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag in TCP connection states is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it represents SYN packets sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if sustained, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
