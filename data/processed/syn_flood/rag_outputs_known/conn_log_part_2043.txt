- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.42.190 on port 8200 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP state with multiple SYNs and zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 203.65.42.190 on port 8200 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
