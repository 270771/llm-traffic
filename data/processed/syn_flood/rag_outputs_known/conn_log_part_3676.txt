- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39999 to 203.65.103.61:16001 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero completed connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
