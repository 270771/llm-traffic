- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, which overwhelms target resources by exhausting connection queues.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 23 to prevent further SYN flood attempts. Conduct further investigation on source IP for potential compromise or botnet activity.
