- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high source port 63915 targeting destination 192.222.97.152 port 443 with 1188 SYN packets over 2.34 seconds, no corresponding ACKs (flags SH, F, F), indicating half-open connections consistent with SYN flood behavior.

  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 157.161.40.85 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and service disruption.
