- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.166.187 on port 503 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (many SYNs without completion) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
