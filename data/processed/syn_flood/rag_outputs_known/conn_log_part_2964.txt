- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40476 to 133.118.231.59:21324 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet sent and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP connection attempt with the S0 flag, indicating a SYN sent but no response or completion of handshake, which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to confirm, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood patterns where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target. Therefore, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
