- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11966 to 203.65.113.216:12146 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
