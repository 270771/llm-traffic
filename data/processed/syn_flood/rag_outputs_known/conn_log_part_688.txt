- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.111.110 on port 53481 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, indicating a half-open connection (S0 state) with only 1 SYN and 44 bytes sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
