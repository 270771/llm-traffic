- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28693 to 202.152.172.211:70 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), 44 attempts, 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood characteristics (many SYNs, no completions), justifying proactive investigation and mitigation.
