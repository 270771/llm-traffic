- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.59.65 on port 9151 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.59.65 on port 9151 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
