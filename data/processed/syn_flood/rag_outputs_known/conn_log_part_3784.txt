- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.87.190 on port 12149 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no response).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
