- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56428 to 202.44.241.28:9943 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
