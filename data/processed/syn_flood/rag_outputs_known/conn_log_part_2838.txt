- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.29.199 on port 16993 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP connection state analysis.
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
