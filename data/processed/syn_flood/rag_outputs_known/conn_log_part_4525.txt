- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.1.174 on port 43 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity from this source.
