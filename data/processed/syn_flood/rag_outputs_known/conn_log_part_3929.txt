- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.41.66 on port 51000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
