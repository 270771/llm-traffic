- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.86.108 on port 8319 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of an S0 flag with a single SYN and no completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt, as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated half-open connections; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
