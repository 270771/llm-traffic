- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.117.187:13579 with S0 flag and zero successful connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
