- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42906 to 133.118.152.22:18030 showing S0 state with 1 attempt and 44 packets, indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP connection in S0 state, which means the SYN was sent but no SYN-ACK received, a classic sign of SYN flood attempts. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted given the nature of the alert.
