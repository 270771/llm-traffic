- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.243.255 on port 8834 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
