- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20033 to 203.65.8.4:18015 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the repeated SYN attempts with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
