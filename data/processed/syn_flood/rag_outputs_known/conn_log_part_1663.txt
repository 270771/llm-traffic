- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.250.164.122:10443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly record and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
