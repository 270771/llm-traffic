- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.62.70 on port 23184 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood, as repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
