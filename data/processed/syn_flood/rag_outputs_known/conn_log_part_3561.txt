- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52113 to 163.21.149.144:16060 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
