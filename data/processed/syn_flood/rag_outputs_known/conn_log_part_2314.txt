- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.161.85 on port 9443 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood pattern.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the observed S0 flag pattern and connection behavior are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
