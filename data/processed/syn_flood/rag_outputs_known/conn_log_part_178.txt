- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.118.101.210:33060 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag and single SYN packet without handshake completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
