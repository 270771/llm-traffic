- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.77.18 on port 50070 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero completed connections are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
