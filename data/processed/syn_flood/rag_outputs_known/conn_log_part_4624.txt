- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 202.152.172.80:21 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion to port 21 (FTP) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.172.80:21 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the source IP to protect the FTP service from denial of service.
