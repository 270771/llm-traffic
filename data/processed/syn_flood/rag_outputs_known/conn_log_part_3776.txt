- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high ephemeral port 58736 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets targeting port 23 strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect Telnet service.
