- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.103.181 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
