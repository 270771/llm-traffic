- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.166.207 on port 5560 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity; implement rate-limiting on port 5560 to mitigate possible SYN flood impact until further data is available.
