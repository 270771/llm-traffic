- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:8363 to 163.21.149.89:1099 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
