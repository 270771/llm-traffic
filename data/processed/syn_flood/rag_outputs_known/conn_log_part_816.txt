- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.16.136 on port 12371 show a high count of SYNs without corresponding ACKs (S0 flag set, 44 packets, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
