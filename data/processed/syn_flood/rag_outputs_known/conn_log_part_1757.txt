- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:9473 to 203.65.89.142:9923 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 attempts with 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
