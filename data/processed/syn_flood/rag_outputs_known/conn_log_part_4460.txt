- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.63.101 on port 789 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
