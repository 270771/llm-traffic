- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.157.211:8069 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.250.157.211 port 8069. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns from this IP.
