- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.89.50 on port 21264 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
