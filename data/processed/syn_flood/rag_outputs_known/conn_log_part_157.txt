- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.23.167 on port 30023 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the observed pattern (SYN without ACK) is a classic indicator of SYN flood activity and poses a direct threat to service availability.
