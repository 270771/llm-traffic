- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.16.18 on port 10006 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 133.118.16.18 and prevent resource exhaustion.
