- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.7.184 on port 10081 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
