- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.134.41 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (many SYNs, no ACKs).
