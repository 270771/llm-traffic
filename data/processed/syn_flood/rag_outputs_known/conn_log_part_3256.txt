- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.9.124 on port 7779 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection pattern (S0 state with many SYNs and zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
