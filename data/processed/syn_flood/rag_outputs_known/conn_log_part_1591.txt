- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6653 to 133.118.197.9:34500 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (SYN sent, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.197.9. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
