- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 6707 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 163.21.137.138 port 503, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume is high or persistent, as the S0 state strongly indicates SYN flood behavior disrupting normal TCP connections.
