- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60661 to 133.250.72.236:9215 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without ACKs or connection completion overwhelm target resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
