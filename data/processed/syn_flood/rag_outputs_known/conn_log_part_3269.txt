- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.12.26 on port 2222 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN-only traffic consistent with SYN flood behavior, warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
