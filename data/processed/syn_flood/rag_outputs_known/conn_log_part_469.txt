- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 138.7.47.145:59558 to 163.21.148.140:8000 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 40 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 138.7.47.145 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target 163.21.148.140:8000.
