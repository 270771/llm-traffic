- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31516 to 133.118.213.151:4500 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
