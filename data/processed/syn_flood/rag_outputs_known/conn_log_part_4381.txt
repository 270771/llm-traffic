- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61483 to 133.118.212.36:45677 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), 44 attempts, 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
