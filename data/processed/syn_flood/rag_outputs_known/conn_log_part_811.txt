- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 133.118.74.192:9999 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received, connection not established). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing the handshake. Without anomaly data, a cautious investigation and potential mitigation is warranted.
