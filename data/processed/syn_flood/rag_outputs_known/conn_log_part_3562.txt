- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29371 to 133.250.188.175:12902 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If confirmed persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
