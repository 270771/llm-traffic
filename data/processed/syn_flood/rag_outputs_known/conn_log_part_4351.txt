- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:17606 to 133.118.96.173:113 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
