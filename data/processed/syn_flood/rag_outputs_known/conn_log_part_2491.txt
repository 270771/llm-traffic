- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4469 to 203.65.31.18:45006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
