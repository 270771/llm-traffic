- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.230.190 on port 50000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
