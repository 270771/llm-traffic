- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.225.192 on port 6000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state), consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
