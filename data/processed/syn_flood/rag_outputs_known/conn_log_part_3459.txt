- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.185.100 on port 4500 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN-only traffic consistent with SYN flood behavior, warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
