- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.24.55 on port 3299 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) are a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
