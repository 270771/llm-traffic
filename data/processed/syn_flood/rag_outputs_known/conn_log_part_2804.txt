- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34366 to 163.21.91.24:11184 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
