- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53114 to 163.21.160.36:29799 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as single SYN with no response (S0) indicates incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.
