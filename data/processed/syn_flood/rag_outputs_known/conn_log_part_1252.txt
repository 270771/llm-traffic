- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.72.217 on port 4242 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
