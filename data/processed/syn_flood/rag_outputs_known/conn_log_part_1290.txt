- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.196.134 on port 195 with SYN packets but no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of SYN packets without completed handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
