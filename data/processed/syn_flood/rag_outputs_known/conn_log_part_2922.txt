- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44129 to 133.250.134.178:11007 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
