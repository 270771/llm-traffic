- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.105.225 on port 52536 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
