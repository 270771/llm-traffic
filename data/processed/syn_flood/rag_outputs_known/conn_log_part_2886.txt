- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.2.154 on port 6379 showing S0 state with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag indicates SYN packets sent without completing the handshake, a classic SYN flood signature.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate for further malicious activity.
