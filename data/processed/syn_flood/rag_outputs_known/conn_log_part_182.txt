- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.21.144 on port 21265 with SYN packets sent but no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with known SYN flood patterns where attackers overwhelm targets with half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source for potential malicious intent.
