- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 203.65.115.55:4506 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior (S0 state with zero established connections).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target 203.65.115.55.
