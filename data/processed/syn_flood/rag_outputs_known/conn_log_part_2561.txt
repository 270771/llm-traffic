- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:27990 to 203.65.103.70:12275 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
