- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:49991 to 163.21.253.126:21305 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
