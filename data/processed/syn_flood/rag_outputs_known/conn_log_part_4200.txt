- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5667 to 133.250.135.163:12149 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 state, 1 SYN packet, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood attempt due to the SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state). Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
