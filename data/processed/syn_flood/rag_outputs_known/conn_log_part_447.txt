- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.134.213 on port 9256 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
