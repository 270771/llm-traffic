- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:1434 to 133.118.208.86:873 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
