- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53529 to 203.65.127.188:12365 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
