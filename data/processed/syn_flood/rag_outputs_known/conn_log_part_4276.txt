- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:27373 to 133.250.173.9:24082 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 connection attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
