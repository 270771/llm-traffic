- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.225.25 on port 18039 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, many SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
