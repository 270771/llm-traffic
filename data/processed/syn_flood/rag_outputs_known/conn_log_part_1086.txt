  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood behavior is confirmed through additional monitoring.
