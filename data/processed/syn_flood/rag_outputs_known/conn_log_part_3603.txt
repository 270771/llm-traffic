- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.47.29 on port 445 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior targeting port 445 (commonly used for SMB services), which is a known attack vector.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to port 445 on 133.118.47.29 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
