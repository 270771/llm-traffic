- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.60.35 on port 2376 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without handshake completion—are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
