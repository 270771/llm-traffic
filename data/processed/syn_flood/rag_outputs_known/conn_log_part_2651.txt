- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51269 to 133.118.230.151:37080 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
