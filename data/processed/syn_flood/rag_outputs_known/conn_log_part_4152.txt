- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:9696 to 133.118.235.223:16010 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
