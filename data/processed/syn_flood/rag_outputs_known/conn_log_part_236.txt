- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.191.104 on port 12566 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (S0 state).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for malicious activity.
