- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16146 to 203.65.38.229:45003 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
