- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with a high packet rate (2.63 seconds interval) and multiple SYN flags without corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as multiple SYN packets without ACKs on port 23 (Telnet) indicate a likely SYN flood attempt.
