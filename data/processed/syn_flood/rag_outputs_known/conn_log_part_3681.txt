- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.213.199 on port 12425 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
