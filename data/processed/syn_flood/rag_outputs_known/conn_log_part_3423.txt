- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.93.4 on port 8090 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
