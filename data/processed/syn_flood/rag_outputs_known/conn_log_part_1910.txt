- SYN flood alert: High volume of TCP SYN packets from 133.118.4.86 to 192.103.164.17 on port 636, with connection state OTH and flags indicating incomplete handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 133.118.4.86 immediately for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of incomplete TCP handshakes strongly indicates a SYN flood attack despite lack of anomaly record.
