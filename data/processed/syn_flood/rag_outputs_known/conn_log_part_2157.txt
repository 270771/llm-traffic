- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.122.50 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
