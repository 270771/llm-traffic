- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.125.225 on port 8126 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8126 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect service availability.
