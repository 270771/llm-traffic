- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58050 to 163.21.72.243:9410 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYN packets and zero completions) is a well-known and reliable indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server at 163.21.72.243:9410. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
