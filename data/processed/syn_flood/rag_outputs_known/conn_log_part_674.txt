- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with no corresponding established connections and a high rate of RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN behavior but lacks formal confirmation. Therefore, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
