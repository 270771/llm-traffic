- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source 167.249.133.167 to destination 202.44.214.159 on port 16006 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
