- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.26.120 on port 8500 show numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
