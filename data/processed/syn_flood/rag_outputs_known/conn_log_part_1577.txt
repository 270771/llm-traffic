- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.50.164 on port 10042 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
