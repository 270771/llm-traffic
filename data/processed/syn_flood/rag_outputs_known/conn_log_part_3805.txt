- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.78.182 on port 2222 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
