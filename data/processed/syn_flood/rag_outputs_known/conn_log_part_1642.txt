- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.7.254 on port 4500 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no ACK or completion strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns, where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate potential SYN flood attack. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
