- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:39879 to 203.65.78.243:21256 shows SYN flood characteristics with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 flag, zero data transferred).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
