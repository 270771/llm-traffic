- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.50.44:9001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert flags (S0, no established connections, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
