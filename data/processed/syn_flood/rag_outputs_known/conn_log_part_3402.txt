- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.252.198 on port 38520 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
