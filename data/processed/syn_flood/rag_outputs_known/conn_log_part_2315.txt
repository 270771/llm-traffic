- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.109.214:5000 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating but not completing TCP handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
