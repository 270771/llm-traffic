- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.229.31 on port 44303 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

(Note: Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly indicate SYN flood behavior.)
