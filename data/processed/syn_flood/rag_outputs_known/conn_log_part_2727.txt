- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31825 to 133.250.109.13:14901 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection pattern (S0, SYN sent but no ACK received) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
