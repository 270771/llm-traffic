- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.48.143 on port 2086 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
