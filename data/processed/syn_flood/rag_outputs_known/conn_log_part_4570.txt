- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.160.220 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
