- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21388 to 133.118.149.222:12396 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects resource exhaustion attempts by overwhelming the target with half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
