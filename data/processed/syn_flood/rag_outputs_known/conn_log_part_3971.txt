- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31996 to 163.21.157.112:10024 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
