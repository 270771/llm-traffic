- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.248.249 on port 12378 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 state, many SYNs, zero completions) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
