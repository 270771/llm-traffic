- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.118.190.93:14147 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm targets by initiating many TCP connections without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
