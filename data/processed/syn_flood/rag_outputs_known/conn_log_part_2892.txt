- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:54212 to 202.152.173.202:23 with RSTR flag and high SYN flood score (0.879253).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a high SYN flood score and an unusual TCP flag (RSTR) response pattern, which is consistent with SYN flood behavior targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet). Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
