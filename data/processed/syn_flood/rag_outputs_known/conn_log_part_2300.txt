- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43465 to 133.118.6.48:18063 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag with a high count of SYN packets and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and block or throttle the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.6.48. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
