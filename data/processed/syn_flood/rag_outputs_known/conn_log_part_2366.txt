- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.82.173:5560 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with known SYN flood behavior patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.82.173:5560 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target server.
