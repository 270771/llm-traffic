- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.237.51 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0, count 1).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN packets without completion are indicative of SYN flood behavior.
