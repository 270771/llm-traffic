- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) responses, indicating connection refusal.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as the behavior aligns with typical SYN flood characteristics (high SYN rate, no handshake completion, connection resets).
