- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:13947 to 163.21.25.186:10007 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the suspected SYN flood attack. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
