- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4603 to 133.118.135.60:10038 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag with high SYN count and zero completions is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly taxonomies.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
