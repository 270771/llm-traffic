- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58522 to 202.44.242.171:10003 showing S0 flag with zero successful handshakes and multiple SYN packets without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
