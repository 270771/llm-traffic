- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.101.107 on port 789 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior. If persistence is detected, block the IP to protect the target server.
