- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58945 to 133.250.94.54:46443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
