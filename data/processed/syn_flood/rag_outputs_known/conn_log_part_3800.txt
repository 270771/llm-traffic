- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.231.113 on port 10348 with SYN flag set and no completion of handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood attacks typically manifest as numerous half-open connections causing resource exhaustion.
