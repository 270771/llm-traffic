- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13746 to 133.250.183.179:20107 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent and prevent service disruption.
