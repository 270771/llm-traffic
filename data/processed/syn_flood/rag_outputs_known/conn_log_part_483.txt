- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.226.159 on port 6697 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns from this or related IPs.
