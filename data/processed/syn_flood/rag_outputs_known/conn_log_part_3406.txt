- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29816 to 203.65.102.247:8126 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (many SYNs with no response), which is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
