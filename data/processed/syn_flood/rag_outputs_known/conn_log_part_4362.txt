- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.99.116 on port 175 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
