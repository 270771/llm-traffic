- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:8363 to 163.21.230.74:1099 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
