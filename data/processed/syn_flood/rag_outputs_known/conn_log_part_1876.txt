- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.49.85 on port 10254 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
