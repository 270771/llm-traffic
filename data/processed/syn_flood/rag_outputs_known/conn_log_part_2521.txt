- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58255 to 133.118.28.31:16071 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for repeated SYN flood patterns, as the observed SYN-only traffic with no handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
