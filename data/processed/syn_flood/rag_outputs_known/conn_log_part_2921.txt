- SYN flood alert: Connection from 167.249.133.167:51618 to 202.44.221.73:49200 shows TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the TCP flag pattern (S0) and volume of half-open connections are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
