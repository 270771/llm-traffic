- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.164.5 on port 10258 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
