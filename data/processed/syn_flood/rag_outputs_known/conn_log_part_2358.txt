- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56490 to 203.65.89.108:16073 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection metrics (1 attempt, 44 bytes, no response) align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server 203.65.89.108. Initiate monitoring for additional suspicious traffic from this source.
