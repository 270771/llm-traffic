- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41642 to 163.21.183.227:21285 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack patterns.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
