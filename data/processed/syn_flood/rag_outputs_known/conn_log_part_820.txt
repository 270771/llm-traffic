- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.77.71 on port 54490 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) typically indicate SYN flood attempts.
