- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 133.118.42.204:60567 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and 60 bytes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 133.118.42.204 for unusual SYN traffic patterns and monitor destination port 636 for potential abuse. Apply rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from this IP pending further analysis.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to definitively confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of a single SYN packet with OTH flag and no established connection suggests an incomplete TCP handshake attempt. This behavior aligns with early-stage SYN flood characteristics. Without further data, blocking outright is premature, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential resource exhaustion.
