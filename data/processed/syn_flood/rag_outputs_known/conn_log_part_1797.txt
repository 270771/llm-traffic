- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.217.134 on port 2376 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic SYN flood signature that disrupts service availability.
