- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48128 to 163.21.190.77:10031 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge, as the S0 flag with no connection completion indicates a likely SYN flood attempt.
