- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 202.152.168.238 on port 8291 with multiple connection attempts and zero successful completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a coordinated SYN flood attack, as the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no completions strongly indicates a SYN flood behavior.
