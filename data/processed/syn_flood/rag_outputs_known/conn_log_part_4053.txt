- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.83.152 on port 14404 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect server availability.
