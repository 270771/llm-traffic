- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show repeated SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, indicated by zero ACKs and multiple RSTR flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion on a sensitive port (Telnet, port 23) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and investigate source for potential blocking.
