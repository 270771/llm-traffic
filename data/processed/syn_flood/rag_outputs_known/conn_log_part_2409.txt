- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.16.18 on port 9916 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
