- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 163.21.106.242:2121 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server at 163.21.106.242:2121.
