- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:43954 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN attempts with no successful handshake and reset responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources. Without anomaly confirmation, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
