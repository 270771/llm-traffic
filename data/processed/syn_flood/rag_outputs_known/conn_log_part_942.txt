- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:16655 to 163.21.235.191:3388 with SYN packets resulting in no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
