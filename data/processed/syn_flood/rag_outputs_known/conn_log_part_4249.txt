- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.44.248.144:60001 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero completions strongly indicates SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
