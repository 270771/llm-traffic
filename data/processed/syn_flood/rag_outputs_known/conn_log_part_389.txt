- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.216.116 on ports 26493 → 12507 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows many half-open connections exhausting resources.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
