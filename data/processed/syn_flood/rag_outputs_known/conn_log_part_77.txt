- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.124.181 on port 2087 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S set, no completion).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is confirmed.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (SYN packets sent without handshake completion), which is a known threat behavior. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
