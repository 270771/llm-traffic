- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.184.51 on port 135 with multiple incomplete connections (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.184.51 port 135. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
