- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.230.170:9000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
