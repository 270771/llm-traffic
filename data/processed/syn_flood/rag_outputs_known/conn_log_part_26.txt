- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32879 to 133.118.10.139:21935 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect server availability.
