- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.21.203 on port 503 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 ACKs).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further monitoring for related suspicious activity.
