- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:28019 to 133.118.86.80:18067 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
