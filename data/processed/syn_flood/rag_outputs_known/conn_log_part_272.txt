- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.173.84 on port 515 with 253 SYN packets over 47.36 seconds, no anomalies recorded.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic available due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context.
  â†’ Action: Despite absence of anomaly records, the high volume of SYN packets in a short time frame targeting port 515 is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
