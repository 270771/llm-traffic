- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.197.253 on port 19014 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious intent.
