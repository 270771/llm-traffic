- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.118.150.87:14147 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with no handshake completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
