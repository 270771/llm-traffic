- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45121 to 163.21.96.172:18063 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN attempts without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.96.172. Initiate further investigation on source behavior.
