- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27875 to 163.21.131.186:12150 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
