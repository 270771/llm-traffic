- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.195.183 on port 6379 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 6379 to mitigate the SYN flood.
