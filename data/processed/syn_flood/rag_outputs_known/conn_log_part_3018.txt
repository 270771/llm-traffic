- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records and heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN packets with suspicious flags targeting port 23 (Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
