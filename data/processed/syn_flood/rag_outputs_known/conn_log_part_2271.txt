- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59069 to 202.44.218.133:14104 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this behavior. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
