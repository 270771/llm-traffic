- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44978 to 163.21.163.245:32303 with SYN packets sent but no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the observed SYN-only connection attempts without handshake completion are a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
