- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.141.246 on port 1200 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
