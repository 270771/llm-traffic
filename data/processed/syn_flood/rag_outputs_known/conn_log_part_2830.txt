- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.104.57 on port 7634 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern (S0 flag, many SYNs without completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Investigate source for further threat intelligence.
