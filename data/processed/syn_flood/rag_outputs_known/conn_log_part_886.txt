- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.37.176 on port 10083 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with many SYNs and zero completions) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system.
