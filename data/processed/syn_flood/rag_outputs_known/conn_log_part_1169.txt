- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.95.128 on port 12582 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
