- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.159.210 on port 11075 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets (flag S0) without completing the handshake, indicating possible resource exhaustion attempts. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
