- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4555 to 202.44.252.116:12551 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
