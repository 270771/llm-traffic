- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61768 to 202.44.192.100:10003 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, as the observed S0 state with no handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
