- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.132.162 on port 80 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior. Without heuristic context, the incomplete TCP handshake (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send SYN packets but do not complete the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further malicious activity.
