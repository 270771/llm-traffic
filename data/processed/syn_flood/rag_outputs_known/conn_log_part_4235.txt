- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.243.230 on port 35101 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 state with SYN flag and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
