- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.244.135 on port 9291 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, multiple SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by overwhelming a target with half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
