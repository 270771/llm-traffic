- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this detection.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the alert alone indicates potential SYN flood despite lack of anomaly confirmation.
