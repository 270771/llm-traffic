- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28693 to 133.118.173.170:79 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
