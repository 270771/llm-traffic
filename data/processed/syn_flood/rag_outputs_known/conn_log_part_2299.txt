- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14837 to 163.21.166.159:49690 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state), a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
