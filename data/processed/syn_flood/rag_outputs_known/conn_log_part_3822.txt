- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65142 to 203.65.94.229:21251 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 state with SYN packets and zero completions) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
