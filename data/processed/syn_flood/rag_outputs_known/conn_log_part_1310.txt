- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.89.96 on port 1471 with multiple SYN flags and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as multiple SYN packets without connection completion strongly indicate a SYN flood attack.
