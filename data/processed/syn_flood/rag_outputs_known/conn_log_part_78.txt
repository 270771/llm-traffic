- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30991 to 133.118.192.7:554 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN packets are sent without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
