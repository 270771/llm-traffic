- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.67.212 on port 2081 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source IP for potential blocking if attack persists.
