- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.106.223 on port 22 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion on port 22 (SSH) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the SSH service.
