- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26260 to 133.118.114.30:27015 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern—SYN packets sent without completing the handshake (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by leaving connections half-open. Without anomaly confirmation, a cautious approach is to monitor and limit traffic from this IP.
