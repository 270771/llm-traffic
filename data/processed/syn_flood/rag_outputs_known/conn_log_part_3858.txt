- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.63.19 on port 2222 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, zero completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
