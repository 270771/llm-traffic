- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26366 to 133.118.221.100:5009 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
