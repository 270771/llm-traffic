- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.129.51 on port 14104 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
