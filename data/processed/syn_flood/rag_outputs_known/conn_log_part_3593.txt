- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36764 to 133.118.137.169:12145 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 0 established) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
