- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.122.12 on port 9051 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
