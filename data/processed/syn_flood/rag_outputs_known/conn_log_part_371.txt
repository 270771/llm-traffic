- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34117 to 163.21.231.58:50999 showing S0 state with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with high SYN attempts and zero completions is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
