- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45404 to 203.65.112.144:12390 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
