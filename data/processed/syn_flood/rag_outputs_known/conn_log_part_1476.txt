- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31710 to 133.250.119.37:29842 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm and block if confirmed.
