- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31802 to 163.21.192.178:993 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state), a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. The recommended action is to proactively investigate and apply mitigations if attack patterns persist.
