- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55721 to 202.44.204.199:10397 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
