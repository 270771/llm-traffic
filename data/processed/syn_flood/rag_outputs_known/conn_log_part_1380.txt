- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 133.118.52.75:59853 to 192.103.164.17:636 with no established sessions and multiple half-open connections within a short time window.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of multiple incomplete TCP handshakes (indicated by OTH flag and zero established sessions) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 133.118.52.75 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
