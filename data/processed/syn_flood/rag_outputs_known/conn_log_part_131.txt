- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44624 to 163.21.66.119:38080 showing S0 state with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN packets with no connection completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.66.119. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
