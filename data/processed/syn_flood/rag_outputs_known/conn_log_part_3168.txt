- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.250.1 on port 11300 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and high SYN count with zero completions are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
