- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.48.53 on port 12363 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (flag S, count 1), resulting in a connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 state with a single SYN and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt, as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated incomplete handshakes; if persistence continues, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
