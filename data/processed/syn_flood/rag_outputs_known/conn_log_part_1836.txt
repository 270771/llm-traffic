- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.12.231 on port 10240 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
