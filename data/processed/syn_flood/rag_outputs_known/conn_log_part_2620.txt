- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.250.188.113:8139 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no response) align with classic SYN flood heuristics indicating resource exhaustion attempts.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if volume persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
