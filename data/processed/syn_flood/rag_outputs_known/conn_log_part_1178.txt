- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51873 to 133.118.146.61:12409 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
