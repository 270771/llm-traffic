- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.173.236:9009 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
