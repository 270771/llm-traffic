- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.41.148 on port 45786 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
