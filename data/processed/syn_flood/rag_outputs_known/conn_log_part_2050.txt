- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52129 to 202.44.200.33:11184 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with known SYN flood behavior patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
