- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.255.8 on port 9711 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
