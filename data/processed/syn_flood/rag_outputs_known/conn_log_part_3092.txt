- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23668 to 133.250.75.222:5577 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects resource exhaustion attempts by overwhelming the target with incomplete TCP handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
