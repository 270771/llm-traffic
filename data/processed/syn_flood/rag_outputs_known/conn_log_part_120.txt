- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28260 to 203.65.83.219:9300 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 attempt, 44 bytes sent).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding connection establishment (S0), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential service disruption.
