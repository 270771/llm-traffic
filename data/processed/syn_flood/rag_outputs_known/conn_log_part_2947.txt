- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53095 to 133.118.104.89:30029 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.104.89. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
