- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.74.70 on port 55388 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
