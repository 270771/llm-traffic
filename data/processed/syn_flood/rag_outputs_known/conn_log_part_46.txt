- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the alert’s characteristics (high SYN packet count, targeting port 23) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack requiring prompt mitigation.
