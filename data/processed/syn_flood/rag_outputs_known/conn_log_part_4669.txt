- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47625 to 133.118.23.220:22082 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
