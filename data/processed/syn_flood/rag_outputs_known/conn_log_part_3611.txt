- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.133.3 on port 14909 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
