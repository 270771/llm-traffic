- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:26492 to 133.250.177.35:5025 shows SYN flood characteristics with multiple SYN packets (S0 state) and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
