- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.200.22 on port 102 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
