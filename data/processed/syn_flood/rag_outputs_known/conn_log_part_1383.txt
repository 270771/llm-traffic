- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56703 to 133.250.135.131:12158 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero established connections) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
