- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.123.179 on port 12251 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
