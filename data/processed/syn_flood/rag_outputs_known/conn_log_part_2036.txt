- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.236.210 on port 9530 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
