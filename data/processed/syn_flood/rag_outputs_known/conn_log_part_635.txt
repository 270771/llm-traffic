- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50769 to 202.44.193.134:12555 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), 44 attempts, 0 successful handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
