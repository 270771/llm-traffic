- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.50.124 on port 2082 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard network security heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
