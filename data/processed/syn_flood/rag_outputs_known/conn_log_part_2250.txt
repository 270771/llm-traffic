- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.13.248:5800 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent. Implement rate-limiting on port 5800 to mitigate impact.
