- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:19550 to 203.65.110.161:15006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), 44 attempts, 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
