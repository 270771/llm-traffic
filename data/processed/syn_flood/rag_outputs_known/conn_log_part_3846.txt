- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.98.227 on port 5801 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard network security heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.98.227 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
