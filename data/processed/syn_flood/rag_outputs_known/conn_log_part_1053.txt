- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.98.165 on port 2087 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm targets by initiating connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
