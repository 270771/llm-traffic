- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:16741 to 133.250.99.178:2379 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
