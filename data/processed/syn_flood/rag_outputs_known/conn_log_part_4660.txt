- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.69.3 on ports 7750→9872 shows a connection attempt with SYN flag set (S0 state), no response, and only 1 packet sent with 44 bytes, indicating an incomplete handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the connection state (S0) and minimal packet exchange align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact. Initiate further monitoring for repeated attempts.
