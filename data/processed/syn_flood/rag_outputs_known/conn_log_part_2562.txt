- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16349 to 133.250.74.61:12560 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion overwhelm target resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
