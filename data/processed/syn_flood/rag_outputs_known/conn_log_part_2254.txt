- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.241.220 on port 14897 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
