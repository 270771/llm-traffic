- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30751 to 163.21.100.144:9387 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0 state, multiple SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
