- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44080 to 133.250.85.68:16084 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
