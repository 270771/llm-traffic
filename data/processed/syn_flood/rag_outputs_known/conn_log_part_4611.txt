- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36596 to 163.21.143.236:12417 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) aligns with standard SYN flood attack patterns documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
