- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.125.102 on ports 22840 → 20547 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect resources.
