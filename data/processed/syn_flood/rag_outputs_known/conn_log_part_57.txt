- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.7.135 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
