- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.233.51 on port 24808 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
