- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:51927 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on port 23 (Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
