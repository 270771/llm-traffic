- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packet from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.37.10 on port 19 with flag S0 indicating a SYN without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood, the presence of a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (flag S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
