- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:39475 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake, resulting in RSTR responses and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no handshake and RSTR responses on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
