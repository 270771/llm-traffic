- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 45.121.111.255 to 163.21.148.140 on port 5066 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 45.121.111.255 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server from denial-of-service impact. Initiate further monitoring for repeated SYN flood patterns.
