- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.81.156 on port 2376 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source further.
