- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.45.221 on port 636 with multiple incomplete connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.
