- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 sent a TCP SYN packet to destination 203.65.83.213 on port 12000, resulting in a connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), with 1 SYN packet and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the connection state S0 with a single SYN and no response is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further monitoring for repeated SYN flood patterns from this source.
