- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6095 to 163.21.42.208:12463 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
