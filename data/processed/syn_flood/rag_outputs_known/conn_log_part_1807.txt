- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:33889 to 163.21.49.93:21001 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
