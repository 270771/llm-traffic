- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:54546 to 163.21.215.27:12318 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and high number of SYN packets without completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the source IP to mitigate the SYN flood.
