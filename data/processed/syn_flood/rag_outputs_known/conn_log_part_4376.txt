- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.189.69 on port 16403 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets sent, no response) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 163.21.189.69 from resource exhaustion and maintain service availability. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
