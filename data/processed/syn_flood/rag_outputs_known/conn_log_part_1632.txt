- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36924 to 133.118.102.236:12354 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
