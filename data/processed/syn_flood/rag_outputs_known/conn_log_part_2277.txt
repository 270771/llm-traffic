- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.183.205 on port 11000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
