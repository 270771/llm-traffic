  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed SYN-only traffic pattern is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
