- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.36.103 on port 50000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target server.
