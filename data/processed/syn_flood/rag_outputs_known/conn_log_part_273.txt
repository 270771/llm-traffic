- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.44.152 on port 2379 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern directly align with classic SYN flood behavior—numerous SYN requests without corresponding ACKs, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
