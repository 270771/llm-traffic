- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.207.249 on port 9151 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
