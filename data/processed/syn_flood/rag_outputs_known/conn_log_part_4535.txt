- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44876 to 133.118.233.2:12472 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without any established connections (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
