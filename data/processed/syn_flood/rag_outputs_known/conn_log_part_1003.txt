- Ping flood alert: 1641791322.152478 CB7HBm2C72d7gz9Bv4 167.249.133.167 16049 133.118.194.227 10252 tcp - - - - S0 F F 0 S 1 44 0 0 - 6  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available to confirm this as a ping flood. The alert shows TCP flags and connection states (S0, F) rather than ICMP traffic typical of ping floods.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious TCP connection attempts; monitor traffic patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as a TCP-based DoS. No direct evidence supports an ICMP ping flood here.
