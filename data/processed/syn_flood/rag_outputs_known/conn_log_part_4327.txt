- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54853 to 202.129.9.165:12387 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the observed pattern (S0 state with SYN packets and zero established connections) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
