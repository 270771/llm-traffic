- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:19299 to 163.21.12.188:9248 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
