- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:62193 to 202.44.229.169:50105 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns. If attack persists, block the IP to protect server availability.
