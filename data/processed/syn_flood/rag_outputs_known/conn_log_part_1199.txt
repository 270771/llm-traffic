- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.131.134 on port 25105 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN-only traffic consistent with SYN flood behavior, warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
