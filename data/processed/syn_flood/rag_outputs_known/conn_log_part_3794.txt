- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.109.14 on port 9529 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 9529 to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
