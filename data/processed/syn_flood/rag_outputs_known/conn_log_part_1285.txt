- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.23.154 on port 46862 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
