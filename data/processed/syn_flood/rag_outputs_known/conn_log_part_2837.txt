- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8110 to 133.118.100.159:10255 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming traffic from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
