- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.203.81 on port 12314 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no ACK or completion strongly aligns with SYN flood attack patterns, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
