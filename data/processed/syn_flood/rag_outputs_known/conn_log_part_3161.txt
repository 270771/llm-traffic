- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.185 to 203.65.103.15 on port 3569 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and a REJ (reject) response, indicating connection refusals consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of repeated SYNs without established connections and immediate rejections aligns with classic SYN flood attack characteristics—overwhelming the target with half-open connections to exhaust resources.
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.185 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
