- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.64.180:10243 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without corresponding ACKs.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
