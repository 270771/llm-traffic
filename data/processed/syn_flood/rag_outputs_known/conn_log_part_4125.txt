- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.87.200 on port 12559 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior due to clear evidence of SYN packets without handshake completion, a classic SYN flood indicator.
