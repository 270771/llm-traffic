- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20131 to 133.250.141.183:587 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
