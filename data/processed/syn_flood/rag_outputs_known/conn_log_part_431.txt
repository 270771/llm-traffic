- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and zero ACKs, indicating incomplete connection attempts consistent with a SYN flood pattern.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics—multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
