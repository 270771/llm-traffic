- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.57.157 on port 135 show a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or response) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
