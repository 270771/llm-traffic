- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56893 to 133.118.56.102:43008 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
