- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28737 to 133.118.18.206:16059 with SYN flag set, no response (S0 state), only 1 SYN packet sent, no ACK received.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern (SYN sent without completion) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume increases, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
