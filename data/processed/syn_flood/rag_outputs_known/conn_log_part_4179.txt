- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64978 to 133.118.184.204:12395 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
