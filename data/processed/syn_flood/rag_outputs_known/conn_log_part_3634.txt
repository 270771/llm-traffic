- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.85.234:9869 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
