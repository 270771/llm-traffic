- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.148.139 on ports 8689 → 12151 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 attempts with 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. Consider blocking if attack persists.
