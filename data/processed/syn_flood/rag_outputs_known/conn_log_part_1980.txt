- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.217 on port 7218 show suspicious behavior consistent with SYN flood characteristics (high connection attempts, no successful handshakes, RSTR flags).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.217 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood activity.
