- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.169.187 on port 3749 show characteristics consistent with a SYN flood (high rate, no successful completions, many resets).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential blocking.
