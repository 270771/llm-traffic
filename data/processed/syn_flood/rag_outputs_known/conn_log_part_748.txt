- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.241.216 on port 54138 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag, multiple SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior characterized by resource exhaustion through half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect target resources. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
