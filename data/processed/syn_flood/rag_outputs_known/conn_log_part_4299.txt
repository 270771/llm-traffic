- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.125.23 on port 4664 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the connection state (S0) and packet pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
