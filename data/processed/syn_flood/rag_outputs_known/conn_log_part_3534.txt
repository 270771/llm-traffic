- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47612 to 203.65.69.196:16032 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
