- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:32536 to 163.21.173.110:25009 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
