- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.228.8 on port 175 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with a single SYN packet and zero established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
