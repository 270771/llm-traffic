- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24520 to 133.118.212.192:3310 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
