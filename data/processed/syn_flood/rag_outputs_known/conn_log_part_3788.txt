- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.231.164 on port 3260 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
