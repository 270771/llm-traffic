- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.51.81 on port 18003 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
