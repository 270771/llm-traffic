- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.242.145 on port 20010 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs with no completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP threat models.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
