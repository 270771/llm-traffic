- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:15175 to 163.21.131.143:20440 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous SYN packets without handshake completion.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
