- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.183.82 on port 80 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with many SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
