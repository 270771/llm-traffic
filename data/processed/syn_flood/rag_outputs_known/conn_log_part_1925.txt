- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.90.239 on port 992 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with many SYNs and zero completions) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
