- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN and no ACK responses, observed over 2.75 seconds with 2 attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection attempts to port 23 (Telnet), monitor for escalation, and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further evidence.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to definitively confirm a SYN flood, the presence of multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs to a sensitive port (23) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate blocking is premature without corroborating data, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential service disruption.
