- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37900 to 133.118.208.205:12159 with SYN flag set, resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 state indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
