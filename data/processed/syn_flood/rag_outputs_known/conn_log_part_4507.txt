- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:22560 to 133.118.202.41:12160 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
