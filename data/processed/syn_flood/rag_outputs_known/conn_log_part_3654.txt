- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56817 to 133.250.129.86:12565 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
