- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30437 to 133.250.96.37:9199 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target service.
