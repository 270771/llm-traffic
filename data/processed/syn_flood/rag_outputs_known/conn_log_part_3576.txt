- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 185.156.249.122:59947 to 163.21.148.140:8789 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 185.156.249.122 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (S0 state with no handshake completion).
