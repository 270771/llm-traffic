- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22112 to 133.250.78.119:9465 showing a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as single SYN packets without completion are characteristic of SYN flood attacks.
