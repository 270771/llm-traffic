- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.89.122 on port 18013 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
