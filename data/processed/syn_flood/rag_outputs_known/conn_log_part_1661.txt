- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 133.118.143.168:9443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.143.168 port 9443. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
