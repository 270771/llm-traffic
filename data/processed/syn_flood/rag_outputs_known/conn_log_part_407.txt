- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) responses, indicating connection refusal and potential SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no established connections and reset responses is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service on port 23.
