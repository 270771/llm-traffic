- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59997 to 133.118.115.104:9280 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
