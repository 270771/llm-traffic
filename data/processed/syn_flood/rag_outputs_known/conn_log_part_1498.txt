- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5998 to 133.250.125.132:9930 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
