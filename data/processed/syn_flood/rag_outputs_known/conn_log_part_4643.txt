- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8094 to 163.21.33.147:15502 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 1 SYN packet and 44 bytes, no established connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
