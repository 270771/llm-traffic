- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior (high SYN rate, no established connections, RSTR flags observed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the alert indicates suspicious connection patterns typical of SYN flood attacks despite lack of anomaly data.
