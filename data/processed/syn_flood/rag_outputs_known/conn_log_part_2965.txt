- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11704 to 203.65.72.37:62237 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 203.65.72.37 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
