- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20217 to 133.118.199.45:8333 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet (S0 state) with no corresponding ACK or connection completion, which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
