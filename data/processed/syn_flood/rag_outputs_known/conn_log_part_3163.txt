- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:26308 to 163.21.14.230:9898 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the high volume of SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
