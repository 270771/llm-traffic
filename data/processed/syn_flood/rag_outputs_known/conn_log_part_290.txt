- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.116.9 on port 1153 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
