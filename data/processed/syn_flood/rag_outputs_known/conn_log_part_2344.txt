- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63718 to 202.44.233.115:49692 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN count 1, no ACKs) align with classic SYN flood indicators as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
