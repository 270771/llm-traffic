- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 on port 25741 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 203.65.84.81 port 10039, resulting in numerous half-open connections (S0 flag) with zero successful completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on this source for potential malicious activity.
