- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37388 to 133.118.100.26:17775 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without ACKs or connection establishment.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
