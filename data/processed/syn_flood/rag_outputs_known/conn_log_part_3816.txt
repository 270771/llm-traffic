- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.170.43 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
