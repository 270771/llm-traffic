- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50721 to 133.250.189.103:9196 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without completing handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with high SYN count and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends numerous SYN packets without responding to SYN-ACKs, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
