- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating half-open connections (SYN flag set, no ACK).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the half-open TCP connections on port 23 (Telnet) are consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
