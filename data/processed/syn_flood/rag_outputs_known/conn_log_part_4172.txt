- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.182.205 on port 104 show multiple SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
