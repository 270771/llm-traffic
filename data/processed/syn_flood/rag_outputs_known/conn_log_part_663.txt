- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.181.25 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
