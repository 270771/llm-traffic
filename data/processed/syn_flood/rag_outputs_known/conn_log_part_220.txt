- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.152.151 on port 102 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
