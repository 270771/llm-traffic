- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.242.207 on port 25004 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
