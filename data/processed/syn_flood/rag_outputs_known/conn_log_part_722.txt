- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51940 to 202.44.202.184:9410 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately due to high volume of SYN packets without connection completion, consistent with SYN flood behavior. Initiate network monitoring for similar patterns and consider rate-limiting SYN packets to port 9410.
