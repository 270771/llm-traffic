- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8802 to 203.65.26.126:17776 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates a SYN sent without completion, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
