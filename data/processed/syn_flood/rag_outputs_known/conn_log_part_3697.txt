- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55588 to 163.21.187.219:12452 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet without response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts; implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to 163.21.187.219:12452 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
