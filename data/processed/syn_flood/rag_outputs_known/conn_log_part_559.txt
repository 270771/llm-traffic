- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.160.140 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
