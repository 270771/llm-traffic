- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with no successful handshake, high rate (0.398987 seconds between attempts), and RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior (rapid connection attempts with resets), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
