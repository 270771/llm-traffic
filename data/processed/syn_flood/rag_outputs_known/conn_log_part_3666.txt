- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.53.228 on port 21296 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.53.228. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
