- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.50.246 on port 16049 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the alert flags (S0, F flags, zero established connections) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
