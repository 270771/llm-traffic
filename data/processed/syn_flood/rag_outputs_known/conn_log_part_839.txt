- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52328 to 203.65.67.36:30001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic and confirmed indicator of SYN flood attacks.
