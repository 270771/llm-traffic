- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.94.107 on port 1023 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood characteristics (SYN packets without completion), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
