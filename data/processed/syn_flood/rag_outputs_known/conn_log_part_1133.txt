- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.11.7 on ports 23001→10283 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero completions, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and packet counts alone strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern due to numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs or session completions.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
