- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48699 to 133.118.53.120:12256 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—multiple SYN packets without corresponding ACKs or connection establishment (S0 state). This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
