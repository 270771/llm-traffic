- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65002 to 163.21.244.125:12566 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake, which exhausts server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
