- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.174.23:9981 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
