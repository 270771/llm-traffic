- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.230.131 on port 1883 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
