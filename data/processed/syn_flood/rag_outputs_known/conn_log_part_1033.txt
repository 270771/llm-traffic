- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.237.239 on port 16027 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume is high or persistent, as the pattern of SYN packets without connection completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
