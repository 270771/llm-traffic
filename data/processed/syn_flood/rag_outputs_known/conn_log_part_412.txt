- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60060 to 163.21.57.131:11182 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
