- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.134.39 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet count strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
