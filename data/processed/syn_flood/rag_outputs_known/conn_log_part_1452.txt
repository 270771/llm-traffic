- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:18438 to 203.65.118.57:50100 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
