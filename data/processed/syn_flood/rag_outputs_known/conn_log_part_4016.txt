- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48745 to 133.118.169.124:12255 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with known SYN flood patterns, where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
