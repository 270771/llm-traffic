- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.165.163 on port 50202 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm targets by initiating many TCP connections without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
