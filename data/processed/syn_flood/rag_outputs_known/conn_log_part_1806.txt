- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28549 to 163.21.4.165:9765 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 connections completed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
