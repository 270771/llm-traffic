- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:8501 to 163.21.30.71:30123 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood behavior. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target.
