- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.200.231:8889 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 0 established) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If SYN flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
