- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.223.129 on port 18028 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect resources.
