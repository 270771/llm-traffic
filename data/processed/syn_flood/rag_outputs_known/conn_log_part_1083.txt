- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27016 to 133.118.253.57:10100 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 state, 44 SYN packets, 0 established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the high volume of SYN packets with zero completions (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
