- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.130.145 on port 9280 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) alone are a definitive indicator of SYN flood behavior, as SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
