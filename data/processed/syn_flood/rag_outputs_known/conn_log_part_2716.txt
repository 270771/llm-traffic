- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:27723 to 133.118.226.199:102 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 bytes, no replies).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristics, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
