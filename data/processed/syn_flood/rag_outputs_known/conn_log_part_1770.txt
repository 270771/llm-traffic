- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.25.232 on port 70 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 203.65.25.232. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
