- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 45.119.198.227:57100 to 163.21.148.140:58220 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 45.119.198.227 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 flags indicate incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
