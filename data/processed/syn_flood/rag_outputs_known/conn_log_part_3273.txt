- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.181.228 on port 13 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 1).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target server.
