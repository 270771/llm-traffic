- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.234.19 on port 14184 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (flag S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
