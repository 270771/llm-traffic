- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.176.63 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly context but clear SYN flood indicators.
