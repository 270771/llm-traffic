- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.138.63 on port 3749 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
