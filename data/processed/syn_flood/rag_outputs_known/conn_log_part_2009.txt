- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:35036 to 163.21.226.159:30019 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
