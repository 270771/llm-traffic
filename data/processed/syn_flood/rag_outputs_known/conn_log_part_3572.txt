- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44212 to 133.250.155.158:12239 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
