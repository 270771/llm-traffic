- Ping flood alert: 1641791071.004218 CNt3tT7lUmhRD4zue 93.81.158.106 29011 → 133.250.83.65 2375 tcp S0 flags
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this event as a ping flood.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of flooding emerges.

**Explanation:** The alert shows TCP SYN packets (S0) rather than ICMP ping traffic, and no matching anomaly or heuristic context is available to confirm a ping flood. Without supporting data, definitive classification as a ping flood is not possible. However, the presence of SYN packets with no established connection (S0) suggests potential reconnaissance or DoS attempts, warranting investigation and cautious mitigation.
