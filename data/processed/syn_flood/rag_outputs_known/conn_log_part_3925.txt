- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60196 to 133.118.23.177:57783 showing a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with only one SYN and no handshake completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the TCP handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
