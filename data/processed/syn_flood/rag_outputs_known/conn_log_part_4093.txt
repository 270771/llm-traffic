- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.86.242 on port 18245 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend rate-limiting incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
