- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.22.88 on port 20202 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.22.88 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood activity due to classic SYN flood signature (many SYNs, no ACKs).
