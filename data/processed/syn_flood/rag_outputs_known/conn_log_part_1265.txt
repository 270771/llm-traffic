- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20106 to 163.21.179.238:16076 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to 163.21.179.238:16076 to mitigate the SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat intelligence.
