- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 (port 65050) targeting 133.118.198.47 (port 19776) with a high count of SYN packets and zero established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP connection abuse patterns.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion and service disruption.
