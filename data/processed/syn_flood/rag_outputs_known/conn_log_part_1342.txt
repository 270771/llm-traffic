- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.100.130 on port 7474 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on target.
