- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.92.2 on port 12323 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN without ACK responses is a classic SYN flood indicator.
