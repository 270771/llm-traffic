- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42302 to 133.250.98.249:9441 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further malicious activity.
