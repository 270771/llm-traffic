- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:27962 to 133.118.186.40:5938 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 1 attempt, 44 bytes, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets sent without handshake completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
