- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7115 to 133.118.229.3:12980 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
