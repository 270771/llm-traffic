- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 203.65.117.2:25818 to 192.103.164.17:636 with rapid RSTO flags and short duration (0.006799s).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 203.65.117.2 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows characteristics consistent with SYN flood behavior (rapid connection attempts with RSTO flags and very short connection times), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
