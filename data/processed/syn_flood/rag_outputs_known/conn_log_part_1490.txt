- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25271 to 163.21.195.129:30001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, zero established connections, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
