- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:12955 to 203.65.63.180:18016 showing S0 flag with 1 connection attempt and 44 packets, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood characteristics (S0 flag, incomplete handshakes), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
