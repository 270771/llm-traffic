- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:24847 to 203.65.36.19:10003 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack, as these attempts exhaust server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server 203.65.36.19. Initiate monitoring for additional suspicious traffic from this source.
