- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.107.210 on port 17 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (SYN packets without ACK responses) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
