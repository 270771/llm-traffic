- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.234.180 on port 9400 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
