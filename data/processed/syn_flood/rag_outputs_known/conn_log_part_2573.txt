- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.244.1 on port 12101 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, SYN packets without completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
