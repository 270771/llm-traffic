- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.97.9 on port 2087 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with known SYN flood patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
