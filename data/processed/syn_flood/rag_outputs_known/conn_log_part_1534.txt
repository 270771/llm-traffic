- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.244.150 on port 587 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact. Initiate investigation to confirm intent and scope.
