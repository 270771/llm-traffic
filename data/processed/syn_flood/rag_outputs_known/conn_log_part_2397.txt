- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.144.235 on port 49 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
