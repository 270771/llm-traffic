- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:31802 to 203.65.96.76:993 shows SYN flood characteristics with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with multiple SYNs and no ACKs) is a well-known indicator of a SYN flood attack and requires prompt mitigation.
