- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 40122 targeting 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F, 0, F, 1, 40).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets with suspicious TCP flags targeting port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood attack behavior. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 and rate-limit incoming connections to port 23 to mitigate potential service disruption. Initiate further investigation on source IP for persistent malicious activity.
