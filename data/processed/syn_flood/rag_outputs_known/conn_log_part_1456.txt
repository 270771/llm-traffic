- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 on port 64207 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 163.21.45.233 port 16071, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the connection state S0 and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm targets with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 163.21.45.233. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
