- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4543 to 163.21.134.181:10068 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood attack, as these represent SYN packets sent without corresponding ACK responses, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 10068 to mitigate impact.
