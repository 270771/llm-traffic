- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.178.158 on port 11 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
