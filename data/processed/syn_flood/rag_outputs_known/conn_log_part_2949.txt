- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.76.255 on port 21 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 21 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the FTP service.
