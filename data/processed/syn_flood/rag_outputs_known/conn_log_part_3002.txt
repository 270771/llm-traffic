- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.68.177 on port 3780 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
