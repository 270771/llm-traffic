- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:64095 to 133.118.63.169:16011 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (S0 state with zero established connections).
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.63.169. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
