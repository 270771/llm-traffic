- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.161.202 on port 17283 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
