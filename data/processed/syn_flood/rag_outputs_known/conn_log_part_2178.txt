- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.33.237 on port 465 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
