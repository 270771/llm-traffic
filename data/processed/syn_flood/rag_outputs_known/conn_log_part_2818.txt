- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28140 to 163.21.49.72:30892 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, consistent with standard TCP anomaly detection principles.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
