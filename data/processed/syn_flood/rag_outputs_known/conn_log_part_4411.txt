- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.96.49 on ports 17490 → 18053 shows SYN packets with no established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no ACK) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
