- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.177.178 on port 902 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts (1 SYN, 0 ACK), which aligns with standard SYN flood characteristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
