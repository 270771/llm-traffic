- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 203.65.73.69 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.73.69 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement temporary blocking if traffic persists to protect service availability.
