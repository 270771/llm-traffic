- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.88.153 on port 12364 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero completed connections strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
