- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.87.247:21025 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
