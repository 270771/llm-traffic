- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:19413 to 133.118.228.143:9674 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior (S0 state with SYN sent but no ACK received).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
