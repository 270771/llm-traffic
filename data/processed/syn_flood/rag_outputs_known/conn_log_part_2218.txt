- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.30.33 on port 18001 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
