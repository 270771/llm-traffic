- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57687 to 202.44.215.244:21284 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server.
