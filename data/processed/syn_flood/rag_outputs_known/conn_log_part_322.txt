- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29916 to 133.118.165.38:21282 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, no established connections, multiple SYNs) align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
