- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.89.152:50050 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and zero completions, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and no handshake completion is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly taxonomies.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
