- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:59074 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with zero successful connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN flood-like behavior (many SYNs, no completions, resets), warranting investigation and defensive measures.
