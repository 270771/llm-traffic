- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11946 to 203.65.81.206:10101 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a possible SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the SYN-only connection attempts without completion are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns.
