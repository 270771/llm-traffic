- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and no successful handshake (indicated by RSTR flag and zero ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without handshake completion on port 23 (Telnet) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if behavior persists to protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service impact.
