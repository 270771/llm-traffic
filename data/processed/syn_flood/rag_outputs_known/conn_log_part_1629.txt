- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.86.87:7001 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN packets are sent without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 163.21.86.87 port 7001 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
