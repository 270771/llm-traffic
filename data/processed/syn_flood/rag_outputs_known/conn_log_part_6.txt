- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4952 to 202.44.203.195:11101 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous S0 flags (SYN sent, no response) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
