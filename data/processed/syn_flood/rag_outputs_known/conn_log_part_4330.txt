- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 202.44.202.192:8140 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 202.44.202.192 port 8140. Initiate further investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
