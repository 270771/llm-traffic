- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13629 to 202.44.211.93:14101 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood heuristics indicating resource exhaustion attempts.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
