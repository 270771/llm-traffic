- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.20.132 on port 54321 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
