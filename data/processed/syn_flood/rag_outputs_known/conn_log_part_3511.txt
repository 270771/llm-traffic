- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.179.110 on port 4730 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if the behavior persists to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
