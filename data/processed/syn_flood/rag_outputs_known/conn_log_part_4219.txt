- SYN flood alert: Source IP 47.41.151.4 on port 29729 targeting 163.21.148.140 port 23 with TCP flags indicating multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 47.41.151.4 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
