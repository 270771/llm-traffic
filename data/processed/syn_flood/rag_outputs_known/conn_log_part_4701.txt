- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11496 to 133.250.121.28:18101 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN packets and zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
