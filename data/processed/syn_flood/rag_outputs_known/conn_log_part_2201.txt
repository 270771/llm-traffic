- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.244.206 on port 25009 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN flood pattern (S0 state means SYN sent, no response or handshake completion). However, no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided to fully confirm this as a known pattern. Given the incomplete handshake and SYN flood characteristics, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
