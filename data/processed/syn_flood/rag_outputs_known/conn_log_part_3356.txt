- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:8270 to 203.65.75.36:9901 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation to confirm attack scope.
