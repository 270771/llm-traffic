- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:41363 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal behavior with RSTR flag and rapid connection attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm typical SYN flood patterns.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:** Without anomaly data or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. However, the presence of repeated connection attempts with RSTR flags to a sensitive port (23 - Telnet) is suspicious and warrants proactive investigation and mitigation.
