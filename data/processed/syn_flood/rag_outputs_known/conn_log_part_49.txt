- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.165.29:8010 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
