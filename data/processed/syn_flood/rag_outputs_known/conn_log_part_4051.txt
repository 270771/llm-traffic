- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.105.45 on port 5222 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flag without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
