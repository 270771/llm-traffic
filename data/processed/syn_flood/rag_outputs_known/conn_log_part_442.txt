- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 (source port 19202) to 133.118.59.7 (dest port 16060) with SYN flag set, no response (S0 state), only 1 packet sent, 44 bytes, no established connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with a single SYN packet and no follow-up indicates a classic SYN flood pattern where the attacker sends SYNs without completing the handshake.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated connection attempts; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
