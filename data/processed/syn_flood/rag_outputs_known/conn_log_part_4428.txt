- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.70.115 show numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.70.115 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (high SYN count with no ACKs).
