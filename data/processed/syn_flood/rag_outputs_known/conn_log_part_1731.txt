- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.143.31 on port 8500 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding completions (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs, zero completions) align with classic SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
