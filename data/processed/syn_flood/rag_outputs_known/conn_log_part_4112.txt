- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise.

Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the presence of repeated SYN flags without handshake completion on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is a classic SYN flood signature requiring decisive mitigation.
