- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.105.125:10243 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
