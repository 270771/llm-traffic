- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.72.148 on port 9600 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 state, single SYN packets without ACK) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 163.21.72.148. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
