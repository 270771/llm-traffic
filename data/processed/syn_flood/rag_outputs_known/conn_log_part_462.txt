- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.175.68 on port 12243 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
