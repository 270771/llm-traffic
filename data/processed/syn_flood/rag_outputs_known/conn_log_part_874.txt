- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.99.25 on port 2121 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
