- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.69.1 on port 9944 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 9944 on 133.118.69.1 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect service availability. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
