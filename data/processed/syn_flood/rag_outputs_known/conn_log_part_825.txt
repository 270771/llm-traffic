- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40359 to 163.21.58.168:22609 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s S0 flag and high number of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
