- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:42768 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal SYN behavior with zero successful handshakes and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no handshake completion and multiple resets on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
