- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.119.176 on port 3310 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, which exhausts server resources by initiating connections without completing the handshake.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect server availability.
