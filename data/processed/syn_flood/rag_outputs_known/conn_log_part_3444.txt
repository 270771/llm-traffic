- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.201.55 on ports 10970 → 16040 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on source behavior.
