- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55097 to 133.250.107.86:15000 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of a SYN packet (S0 state) with no corresponding connection establishment and only one SYN sent suggests a possible SYN flood attempt. Without anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
