- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:20207 to 133.118.62.52:12209 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation; consider blocking if attack persists.
