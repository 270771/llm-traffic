- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22153 to 203.65.105.184:21279 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert flags (S0, F) and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completion, causing resource exhaustion.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
