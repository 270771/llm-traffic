- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.203.164 on port 3310 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential service disruption and investigate source for further malicious activity.
