- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 107.81.9.228 and monitor traffic for escalation; investigate source for potential malicious activity.

**Explanation:**  
Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks designed to exhaust server resources. Proactive rate-limiting and investigation are warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
