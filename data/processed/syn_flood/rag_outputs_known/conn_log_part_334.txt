- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.51.193 on port 36505 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target system.
