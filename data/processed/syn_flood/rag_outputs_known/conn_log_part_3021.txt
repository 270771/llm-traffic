- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.242.218:8086 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
