- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.20.35 on ports 18746 → 11401 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows multiple SYN attempts without completion (S0), a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. The volume (44 attempts) and zero successful connections strongly suggest malicious intent. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
