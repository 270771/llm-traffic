- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21574 to 163.21.25.110:21233 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet sent and 0 responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further data.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP SYN packet sent without any response (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate blocking is premature, but proactive investigation and rate-limiting will mitigate risk while gathering more evidence.
