- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.169.225 on port 52931 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if SYN flood persists.
