- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:15165 to 133.118.224.12:21283 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and packet counts directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs or session completions.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
