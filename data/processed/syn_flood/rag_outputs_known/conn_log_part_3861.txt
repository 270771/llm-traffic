- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.229.132:4321 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 packets, 0 established) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
