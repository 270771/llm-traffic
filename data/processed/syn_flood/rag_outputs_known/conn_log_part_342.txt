- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:22369 to 163.21.55.103:6379 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 163.21.55.103:6379 from resource exhaustion due to suspected SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
