- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.122.10 on port 12219 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed behavior (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic and confirmed indicator of SYN flood attacks even without explicit anomaly records or heuristic context.
