- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.106.109 on port 5222 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 established connections).
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
