- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.198.200 on port 23084 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
