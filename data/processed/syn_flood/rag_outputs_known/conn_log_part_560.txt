- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:51967 to 133.250.147.49:38880 shows SYN packets with no established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior alone are definitive indicators of SYN flood activity.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
