- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.70.158 on port 789 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous half-open connections intended to exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
