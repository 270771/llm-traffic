- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 203.65.107.16:45022 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and no established connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 203.65.107.16 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests a potential SYN flood due to the presence of a single SYN packet without completion, but confirmation requires further data. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
