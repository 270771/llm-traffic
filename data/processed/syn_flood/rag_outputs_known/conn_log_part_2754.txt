- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.232.107 on port 18108 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
