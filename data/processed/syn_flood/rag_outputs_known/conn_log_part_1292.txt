- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 55453 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP flags indicating RSTR (Reset-Received) and short duration (0.201732 seconds).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic context available to confirm SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection attempts to port 23; monitor traffic for repeated SYN requests and consider rate-limiting connections from this IP pending further evidence.

**Explanation:** Without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation of a SYN flood is not possible. However, the short connection duration and reset flags on a typically vulnerable port (23 - Telnet) warrant proactive investigation and cautious mitigation.
