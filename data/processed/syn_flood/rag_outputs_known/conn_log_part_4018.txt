- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20041 to 202.44.250.43:2222 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
