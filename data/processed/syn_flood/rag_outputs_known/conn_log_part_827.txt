- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
