- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:1783 to 133.250.127.225:65432 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (SYN sent, no response) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
