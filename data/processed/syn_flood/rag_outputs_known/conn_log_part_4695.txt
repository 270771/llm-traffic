- SYN flood alert: Source IP 167.249.133.167 on high source port 33660 targeting destination IP 133.250.161.199 on port 14400 with TCP flags indicating SYN packets (S0 state), 44 packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without responses (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
