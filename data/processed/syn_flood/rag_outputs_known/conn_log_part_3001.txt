- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.183.164 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with a single SYN and no follow-up handshake is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
