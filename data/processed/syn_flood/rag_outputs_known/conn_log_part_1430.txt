- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.94.71 on port 12000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the connection state (S0) and packet pattern strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
