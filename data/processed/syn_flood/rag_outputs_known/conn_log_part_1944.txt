- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.110.244 on port 51001 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and packet counts indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
