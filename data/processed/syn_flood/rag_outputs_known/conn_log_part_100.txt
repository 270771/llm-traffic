- Ping flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:11482 to 133.118.207.247:18031 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm ping flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity; monitor traffic patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if flood behavior is confirmed.

**Explanation:** The alert shows a TCP SYN attempt with no response (S0), which is not an ICMP ping flood but could indicate a SYN scan or incomplete connection attempts. Without anomaly data or heuristics, this cannot be confirmed as a ping flood. However, proactive investigation and monitoring are warranted.
