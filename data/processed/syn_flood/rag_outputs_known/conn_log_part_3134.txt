- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54301 to 133.118.142.73:12416 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with no ACK or established connection strongly aligns with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If persistence is observed, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
