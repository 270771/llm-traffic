- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.239.213 on port 21246 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.

Despite the absence of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion) is a well-known attack signature requiring prompt mitigation.
