- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.114.123 on port 12289 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect service availability.
