- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.130.173 on port 2000 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks per standard network security heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
