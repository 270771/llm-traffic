- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.157.250:37215 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
