- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.235.99 on port 21322 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs with no ACKs) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
