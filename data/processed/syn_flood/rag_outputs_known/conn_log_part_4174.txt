- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.231.142:7547 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) are indicative of SYN flood behavior.
