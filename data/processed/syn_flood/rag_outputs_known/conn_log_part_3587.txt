- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no successful handshake completion, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and monitor connection rates; consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the alert indicates potential SYN flood characteristics despite lack of anomaly confirmation.
