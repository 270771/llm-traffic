- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.0.180 on port 21318 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.0.180, as the SYN flood pattern is evident from connection state flags despite lack of anomaly metadata.
