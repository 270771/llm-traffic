- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.37.246 on port 111 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
