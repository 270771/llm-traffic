- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.160.20 on port 9595 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
