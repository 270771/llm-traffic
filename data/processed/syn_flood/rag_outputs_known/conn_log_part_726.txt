- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.55.40 on port 35000, characterized by numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (flag S0, indicating half-open connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags and connection behavior (many SYNs, no completions).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
