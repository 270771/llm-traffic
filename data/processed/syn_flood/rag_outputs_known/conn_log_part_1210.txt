- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.46.146 on port 2087 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 2087 to mitigate impact.
