- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.71.200 on port 4949 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) combined with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
