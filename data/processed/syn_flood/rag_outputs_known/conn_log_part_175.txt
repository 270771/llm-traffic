- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50780 to 203.65.75.164:15588 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 state with a single SYN and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for repeated attempts to prevent resource exhaustion.
