- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.44.9 on port 9090 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server at 133.118.44.9 on port 9090 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
