- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4637 to 163.21.107.144:9465 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target host. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
