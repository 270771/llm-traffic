- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.14.119 on port 18022 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (many SYN packets with no response), which is a known threat behavior. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
