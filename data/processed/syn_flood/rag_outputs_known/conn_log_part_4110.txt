- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.130.221 on port 18012 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) combined with a high number of SYN packets (44) and zero completions strongly aligns with classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
