- SYN flood alert: Connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6976 to 133.250.75.214:9299 shows TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), with 44 connection attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
