- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.157.175 on port 10243 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
