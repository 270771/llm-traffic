- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 20131 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 133.250.80.247 port 587, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
