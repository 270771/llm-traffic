- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.221.199 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0, 1 SYN, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of a SYN packet without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
