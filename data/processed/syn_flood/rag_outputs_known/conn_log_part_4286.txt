- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.239.58 on port 5986 shows a SYN packet with no established connection (S0 flag), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN flag and zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
