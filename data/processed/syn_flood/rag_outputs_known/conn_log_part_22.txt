- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.224.239 on port 21271 shows a SYN flood pattern with 44 SYN packets sent and zero completions (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the high volume of incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) is a definitive indicator of SYN flood attack behavior.
