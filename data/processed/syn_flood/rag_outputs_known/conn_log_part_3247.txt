- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.107.216 on port 3001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (taxonomy: SYN flood - overwhelming target with SYN requests to exhaust resources).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
