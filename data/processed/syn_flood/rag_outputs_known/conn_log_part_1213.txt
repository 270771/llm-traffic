- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.53.84 on port 992 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior (numerous SYNs without handshake completion).  
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
