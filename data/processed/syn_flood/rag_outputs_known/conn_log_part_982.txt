- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.104.128 on port 12508 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, no completions) are textbook indicators of a SYN flood.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
