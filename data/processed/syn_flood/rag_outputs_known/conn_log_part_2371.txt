- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8381 to 163.21.11.237:12549 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and zero successful connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.
