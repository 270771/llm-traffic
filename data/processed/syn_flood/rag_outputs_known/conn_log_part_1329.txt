- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.182.113:4063 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
