- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:62114 to 163.21.122.126:9900 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—align with standard SYN flood patterns where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
