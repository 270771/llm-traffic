- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.143.91 on port 5007 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in network security.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
