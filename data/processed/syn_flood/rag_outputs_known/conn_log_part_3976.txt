- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.137.22 on port 9674 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 packets, 0 established) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
