- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65061 to 163.21.99.189:30111 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (S0 state with 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the source IP to protect the target server.
