- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.15.232 on port 1599 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (S0 state).
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
