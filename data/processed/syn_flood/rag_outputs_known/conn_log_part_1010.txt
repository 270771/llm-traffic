  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior as a ping flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual TCP connection attempts and monitor traffic; consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as attack.

Explanation: The alert shows TCP traffic with S0 flag (connection attempt without response), which is not ICMP ping flood traffic. Without anomaly or heuristic data, this cannot be confirmed as a ping flood. However, the suspicious connection attempts warrant investigation and potential mitigation.
