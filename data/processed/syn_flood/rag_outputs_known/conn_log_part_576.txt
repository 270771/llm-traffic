- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:39917 to 133.250.78.225:12178 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in S0 (SYN sent, no response) state and only 1 connection attempt with 44 bytes sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge, as the single event alone is insufficient for definitive SYN flood classification without anomaly or heuristic support.
