- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16245 to 133.250.123.161:2380 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag, SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
