- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:52900 to 203.65.78.81:19082 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target 203.65.78.81, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
