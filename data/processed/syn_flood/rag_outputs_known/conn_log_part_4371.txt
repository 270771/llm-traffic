- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9674 to 202.44.227.69:9950 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without completing handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN attempts without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
