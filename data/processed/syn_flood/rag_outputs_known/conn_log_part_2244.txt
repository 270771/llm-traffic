- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:6426 to 133.250.175.195:22107 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYNs and zero completions is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
