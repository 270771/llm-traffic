- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.100.47:3689 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), 44 attempts with zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
