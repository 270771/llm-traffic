- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:18055 to 163.21.208.127:12299 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0 state, multiple SYNs with zero completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
