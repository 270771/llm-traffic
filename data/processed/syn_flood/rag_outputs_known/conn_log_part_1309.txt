- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6699 to 203.65.112.20:12426 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
