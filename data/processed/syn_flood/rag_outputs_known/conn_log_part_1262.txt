- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:57753 to 163.21.174.236:55350 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
