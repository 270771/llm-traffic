- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.103.167 on port 30468 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 state means SYN sent but no response), which is a classic sign of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
