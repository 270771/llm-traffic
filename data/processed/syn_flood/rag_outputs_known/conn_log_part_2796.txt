- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.96.81 on port 2083 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
