- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41613 to 133.250.165.68:15502 with SYN packets sent but no completion (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN sent and no ACK) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
