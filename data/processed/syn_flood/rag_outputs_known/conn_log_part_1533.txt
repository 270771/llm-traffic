- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.101.143 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no ACK response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
