- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.108.114 on port 44332 show SYN packets with no completion of handshake (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the S0 flag and single SYN packet without handshake completion is a definitive indicator of SYN flood behavior.
