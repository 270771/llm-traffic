- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29540 to 133.118.87.87:50202 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated incomplete handshakes; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
