- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55411 to 133.118.146.7:19013 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag (connection attempt seen, no reply) and high packet count with zero completions strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
