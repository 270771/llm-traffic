- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.118.60 on port 3128 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
