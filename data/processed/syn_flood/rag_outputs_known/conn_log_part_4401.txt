- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:23533 to 133.118.48.69:11007 showing S0 state with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without completing handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state with numerous incomplete handshakes is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the TCP handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
