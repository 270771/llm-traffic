- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.215.216 on port 2404 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
