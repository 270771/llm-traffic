- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.123.16 on port 1400 with flag S0 indicating connection attempts without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the S0 flag and high SYN count strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern despite lack of anomaly data.
