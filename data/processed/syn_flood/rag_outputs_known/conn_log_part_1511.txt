- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.43.127 on port 18078 with SYN flag set, resulting in no established connection (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate further for potential coordinated attack.
