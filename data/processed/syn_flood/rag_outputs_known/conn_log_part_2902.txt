- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42273 to 163.21.104.132:12475 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 0 connections established).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion, a classic sign of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
