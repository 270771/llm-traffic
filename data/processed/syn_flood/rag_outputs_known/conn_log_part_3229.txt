- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26492 to 202.44.236.102:5025 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
