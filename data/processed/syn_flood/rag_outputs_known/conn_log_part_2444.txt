- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:32335 to 133.118.139.153:264 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
