- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.220.166 on port 8087 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
