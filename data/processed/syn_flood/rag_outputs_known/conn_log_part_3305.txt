- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.174.101 on port 9918 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
