- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.142.157 on port 18039 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with only SYN sent and no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
