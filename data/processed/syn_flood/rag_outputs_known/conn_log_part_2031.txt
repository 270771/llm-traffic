- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:17686 to 202.44.212.196:62078 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN packet sent without completing the TCP handshake (S0 state), which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
