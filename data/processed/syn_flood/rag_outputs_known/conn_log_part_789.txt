- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.118.143.4:21025 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
