- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.150.106 on ports 26571 → 21263 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion—is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
