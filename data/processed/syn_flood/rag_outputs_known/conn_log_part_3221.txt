- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29141 to 133.118.220.96:40005 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0 state, single SYN packet, no response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
