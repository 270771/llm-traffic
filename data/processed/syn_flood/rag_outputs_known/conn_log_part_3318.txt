- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:33889 to 163.21.198.67:16074 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.198.67. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
