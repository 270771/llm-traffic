- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:8108 to 203.65.9.202:9999 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics (numerous SYNs without ACKs).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 203.65.9.202:9999 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
