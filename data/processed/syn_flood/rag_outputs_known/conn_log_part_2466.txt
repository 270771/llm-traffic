- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.143.93 on port 9292 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, and initiate further network traffic investigation to confirm attack scope.

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the presence of numerous half-open connections (S0 state) with no handshake completion is a classic and definitive indicator of a SYN flood attack. This justifies assertive mitigation steps.
