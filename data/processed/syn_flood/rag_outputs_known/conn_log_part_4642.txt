- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52977 to 133.250.186.249:12536 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern, as SYN floods exploit incomplete TCP handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
