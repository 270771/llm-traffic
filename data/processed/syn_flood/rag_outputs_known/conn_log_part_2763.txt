- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44550 to 133.118.245.120:58585 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with classic SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
