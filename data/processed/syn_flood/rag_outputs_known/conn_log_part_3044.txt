- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.20.234 on port 6000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential service disruption and investigate source for further malicious activity.
