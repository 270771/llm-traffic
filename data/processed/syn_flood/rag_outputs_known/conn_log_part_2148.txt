- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:15188 to 163.21.111.94:3299 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
