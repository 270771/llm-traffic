- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.164.224 on port 1400 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
