- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29293 to 163.21.97.15:4840 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
