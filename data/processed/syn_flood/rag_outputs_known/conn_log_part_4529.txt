- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.212.80 on port 12113 with SYN packets sent but no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) which exhaust server resources.
