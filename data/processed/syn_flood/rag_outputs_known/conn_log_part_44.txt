- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.96.23 on port 5801 show SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed TCP flags and connection pattern (S0) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
