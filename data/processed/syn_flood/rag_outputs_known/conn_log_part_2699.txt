- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44222 to 203.65.51.229:10093 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
