- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.91.220 on port 8545 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
