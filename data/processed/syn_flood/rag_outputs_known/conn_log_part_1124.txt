- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8495 to 202.44.217.39:9222 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood alert itself shows classic SYN flood indicators: numerous SYN packets without completion of the TCP handshake (S0), which is a well-known pattern of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
