- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23183 to 133.118.196.40:25001 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further investigation on this source IP.
