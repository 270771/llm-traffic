- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.174.247 on port 31444 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN only) is a known indicator of SYN flood attacks and warrants proactive investigation.
