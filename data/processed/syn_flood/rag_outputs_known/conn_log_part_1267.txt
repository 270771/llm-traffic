- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 to destination IP 163.21.149.254 on port 8001, characterized by numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block source IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic, as the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (SYN packets sent without ACK responses), which exhausts server resources and disrupts service.
