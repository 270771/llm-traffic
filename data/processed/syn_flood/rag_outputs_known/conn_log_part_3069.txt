- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.88.5 on port 5560 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 93.81.158.106 targeting port 5560 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server.
