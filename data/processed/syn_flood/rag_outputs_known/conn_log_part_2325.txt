- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28588 to 133.250.145.56:9210 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
