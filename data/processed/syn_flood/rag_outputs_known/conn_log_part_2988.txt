- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.103.222 on port 8099 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature that disrupts service availability.
