- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:62803 to 203.65.98.108:52931 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 connection attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target 203.65.98.108.
