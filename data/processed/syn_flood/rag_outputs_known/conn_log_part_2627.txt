- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.146.25 on ports 19852 → 12530 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect resources.
