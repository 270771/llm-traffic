- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 133.250.71.187 on port 1471, with a high count of initial SYNs (S0 state) and no completed handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
