- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:29014 to 202.152.172.140:18082 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—align with standard SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
