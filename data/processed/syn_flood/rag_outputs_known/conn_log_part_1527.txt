- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32713 to 133.250.98.164:18006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and single SYN packet without response strongly align with typical SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
