- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 (source port 40459) to 163.21.168.129 (destination port 12374) show a pattern of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag set), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server from denial-of-service impact. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
