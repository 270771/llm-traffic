- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.250.162.179:666 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating many half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
