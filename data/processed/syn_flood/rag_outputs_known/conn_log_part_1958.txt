- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.174.130 on port 21306 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no response, multiple attempts) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (S0 state).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect server resources. Initiate investigation on source to confirm intent and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
