- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.89.76 on port 8500 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
