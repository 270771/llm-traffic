- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52604 to 163.21.9.137:12247 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, which exhaust server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
