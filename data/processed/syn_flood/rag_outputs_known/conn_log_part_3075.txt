- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:15722 to 203.65.67.112:21297 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
