- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.149.110 on port 3001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
