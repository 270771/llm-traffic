- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on high ephemeral port 17340 targeting destination 163.21.136.33 port 80 with TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), 44 packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) to a common service port (80) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
