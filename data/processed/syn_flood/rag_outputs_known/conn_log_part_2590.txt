- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57765 to 133.118.54.187:49200 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—align with classic SYN flood patterns known to exhaust server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
