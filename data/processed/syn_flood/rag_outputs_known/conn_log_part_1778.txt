- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.172.231 on port 12551 showing SYN packets without completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
