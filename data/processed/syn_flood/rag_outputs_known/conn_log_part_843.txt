- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60355 to 133.250.97.230:12498 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN sent only, no ACK) and packet pattern (single SYN, no response) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.250.97.230. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
