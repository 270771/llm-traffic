- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.80.73 on port 37080 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for malicious activity.
