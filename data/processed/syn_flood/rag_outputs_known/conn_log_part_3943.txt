- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.127.149 on port 2762 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYNs and no handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator warranting proactive mitigation.
