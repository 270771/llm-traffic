- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.155.167 on port 14873 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag with a single SYN and zero established connections is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
