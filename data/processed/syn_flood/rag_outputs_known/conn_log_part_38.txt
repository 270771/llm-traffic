- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7746 to 133.118.181.241:12178 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without ACK confirm classic SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
