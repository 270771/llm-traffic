- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.68.94 on ports 15618 → 16086 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with a single SYN packet and no established connection is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack volume increases.
