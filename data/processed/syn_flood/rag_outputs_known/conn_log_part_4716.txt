- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 93.81.158.106 targeting destination IP 133.118.6.58 on port 1883, characterized by numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact, and initiate further investigation to confirm attack scope.

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic documentation, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic and well-understood indicator of a SYN flood attack, justifying proactive mitigation.
