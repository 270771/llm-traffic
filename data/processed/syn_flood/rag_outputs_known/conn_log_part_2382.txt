- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.223.40 on port 18056 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the SYN flood alert itself indicates detection of incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state), a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
