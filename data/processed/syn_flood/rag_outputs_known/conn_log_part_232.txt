- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.100.49 on port 43200 showing S0 flag with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating SYN packets sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag with multiple connection attempts and zero completions is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the TCP handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
