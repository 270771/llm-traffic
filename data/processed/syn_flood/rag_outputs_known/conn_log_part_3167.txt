- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:4331 to 133.118.7.113:10019 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the SYN flood signature (S0 state with SYN only) strongly indicates a denial-of-service attempt.
