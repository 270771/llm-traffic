- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41961 to 133.118.3.186:21200 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.3.186, as the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN packets only) is a well-known threat signature. Initiate further investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
