- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38872 to 133.118.255.70:10936 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
