- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33962 to 133.250.130.217:10943 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
