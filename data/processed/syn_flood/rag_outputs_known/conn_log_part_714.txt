- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with TCP flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH flags, multiple failed attempts).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern (high SYN packets with no established connections on port 23, a common Telnet port) is consistent with SYN flood attacks. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and further attack impact. Initiate investigation on source and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
