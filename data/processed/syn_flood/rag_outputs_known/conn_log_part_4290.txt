- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9325 to 163.21.215.143:25008 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
