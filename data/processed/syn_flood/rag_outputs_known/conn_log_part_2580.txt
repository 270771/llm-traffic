- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.96.10 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection attempt count (1 SYN, 0 ACKs) directly align with classic SYN flood indicators.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood attack.
