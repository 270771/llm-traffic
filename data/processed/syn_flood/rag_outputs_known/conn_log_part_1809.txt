- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.73.72 on port 2222 shows a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 44 SYNs, 0 established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: Although no explicit anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
