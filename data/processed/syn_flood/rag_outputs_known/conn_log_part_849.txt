- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.76.104 on port 18016 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
