- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.164.2 on port 83 show SYN packets with no completion of handshake (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without ACKs) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
