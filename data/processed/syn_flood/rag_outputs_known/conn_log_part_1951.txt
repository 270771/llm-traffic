- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.32.103 on port 12168 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for repeated SYN flood behavior, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
