- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33728 to 163.21.76.97:12577 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.76.97. Initiate further monitoring for additional suspicious activity from this source.
