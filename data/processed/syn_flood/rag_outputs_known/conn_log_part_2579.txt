- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.195.239 on ports 2427 → 12439 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
