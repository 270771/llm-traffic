- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.176.188 on port 12478 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
