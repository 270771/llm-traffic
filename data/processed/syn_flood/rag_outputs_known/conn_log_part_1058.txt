- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:32865 to 133.118.108.16:16075 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection failure count strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect target 133.118.108.16 from resource exhaustion.
