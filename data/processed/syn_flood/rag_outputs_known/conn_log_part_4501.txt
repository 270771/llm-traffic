- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 22369 targeting 203.65.18.121 port 6379 shows multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed S0 flag pattern (SYN sent, no response) and repeated connection attempts strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target service on port 6379 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
