- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53180 to 133.250.106.204:12410 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
