- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.229.212 on port 8443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate, but the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
