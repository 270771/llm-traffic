- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.22.96 on port 110 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 state with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
