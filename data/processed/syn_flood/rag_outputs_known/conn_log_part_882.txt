- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.65.55:50050 shows SYN packets with no established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
