- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.92.132 on port 30019 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 flag, single SYN packet without completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
