- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5519 to 163.21.182.169:9190 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag indicates SYN packets sent without completing the TCP handshake, a classic signature of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity from this source.
