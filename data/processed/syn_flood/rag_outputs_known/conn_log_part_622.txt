- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.19.158 on port 16831 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without responses (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
