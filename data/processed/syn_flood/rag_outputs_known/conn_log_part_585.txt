- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26366 to 203.65.15.91:5009 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
