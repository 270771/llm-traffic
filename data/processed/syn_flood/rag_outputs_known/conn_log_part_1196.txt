- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.28.246 on port 8880 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s pattern (S0 flag, multiple SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
