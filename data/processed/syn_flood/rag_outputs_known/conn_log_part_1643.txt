- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.242.162:8834 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
