- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.252.189:9981 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN packets without handshake completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
