- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.156.178 on port 5009 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact. Initiate further investigation on this source for persistent malicious activity.
