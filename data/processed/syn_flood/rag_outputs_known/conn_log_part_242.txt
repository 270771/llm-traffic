- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.209.70 on port 443 shows a single SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly taxonomies.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
