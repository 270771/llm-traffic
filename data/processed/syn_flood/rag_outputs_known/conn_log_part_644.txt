- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10909 to 133.118.227.10:14880 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as repeated SYNs without handshake completion strongly indicate SYN flood behavior.
