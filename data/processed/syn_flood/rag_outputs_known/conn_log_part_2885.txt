- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.96.58 on port 9051 with SYN packets not completing handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as incomplete TCP handshakes (S0) are a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
