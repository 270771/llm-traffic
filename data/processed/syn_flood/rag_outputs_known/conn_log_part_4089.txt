- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52128 to 133.250.101.77:9456 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
