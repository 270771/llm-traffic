- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.201.25 on port 2222 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 state with zero established connections) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
