- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.27.92 on port 4063 shows a single SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the observed half-open connection is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
