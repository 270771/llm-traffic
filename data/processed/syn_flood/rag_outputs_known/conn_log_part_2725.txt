- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50539 to 133.118.251.102:24510 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
