- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.19.149:10243 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
