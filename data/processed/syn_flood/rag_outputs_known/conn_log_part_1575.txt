- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46249 to 133.118.176.20:18067 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating SYN packets sent without completion.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
