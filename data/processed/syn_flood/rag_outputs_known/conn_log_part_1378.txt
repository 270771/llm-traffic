- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.192.73:9000 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, no established connections, single SYN packet count) align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If SYN flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
