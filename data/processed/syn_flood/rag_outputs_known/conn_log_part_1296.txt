- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.6.172 on port 2082 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as single SYN with no response is a classic SYN flood indicator.
