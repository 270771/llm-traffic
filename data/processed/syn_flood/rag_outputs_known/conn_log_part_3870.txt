- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:60248 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN requests with no established connections, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or documented heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges, as the alert alone indicates suspicious connection resets consistent with SYN flood behavior.
