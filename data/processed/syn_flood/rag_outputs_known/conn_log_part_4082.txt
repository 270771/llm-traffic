- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.112.137 on port 12584 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of such attempts (44) strongly align with known SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
