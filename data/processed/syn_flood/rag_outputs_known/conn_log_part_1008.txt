- Ping flood alert: 1641791227.021707 CGbv9N3YVV8zaZDnNf 93.81.158.106 23320 133.250.92.230 5986 tcp - - - - S0 F F 0 S 1 44 0 0 - 6  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID found, no heuristic or taxonomy context available.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious TCP SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed malicious.  

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the alert shows a TCP connection attempt with SYN sent (S0) and no established connection, which is consistent with a SYN flood pattern rather than an ICMP ping flood. Immediate investigation and mitigation of this suspicious TCP traffic is warranted.
