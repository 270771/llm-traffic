- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 45.240.235.156 to 203.65.103.15 on port 366 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful completions, resulting in REJ (reject) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 45.240.235.156 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the pattern of repeated SYNs with no completions and REJ responses is consistent with SYN flood attack characteristics.
