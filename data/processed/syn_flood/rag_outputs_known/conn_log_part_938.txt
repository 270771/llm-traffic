- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:28145 to 133.118.155.229:12589 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYN attempts and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect target 133.118.155.229.
