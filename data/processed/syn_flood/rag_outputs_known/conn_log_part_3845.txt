- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.93.88:4040 with SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious.

Despite the lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of SYN packets without completed handshakes (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
