- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.126.252 on port 8500 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood characteristics (numerous SYNs without handshake completion), preventing resource exhaustion on the target server.
