- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 sent a TCP SYN packet to destination 133.118.133.54 on port 135, resulting in a connection attempt with no response (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion) justifies immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
