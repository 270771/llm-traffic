- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37964 to 163.21.100.47:16083 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity; consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or SYN-ACK, consistent with SYN flood behavior (S0 state). However, absence of anomaly records and heuristic context limits definitive confirmation. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
