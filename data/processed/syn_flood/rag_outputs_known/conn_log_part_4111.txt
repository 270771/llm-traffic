- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.181.43 on port 5269 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flag without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
