- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.152.169.25 on port 9754 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions, resulting in REJ (reject) responses and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs without completions and REJ responses is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
