- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.225.77 on port 18081 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
