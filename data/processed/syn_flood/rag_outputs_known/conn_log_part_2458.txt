- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.20.246 on port 50102 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag set), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
