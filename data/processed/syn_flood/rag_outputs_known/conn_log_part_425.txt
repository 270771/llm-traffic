- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.244.221 on port 5432 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly record found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics (S0 flag, many SYNs, zero completions) align with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security heuristics.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 targeting port 5432 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the service.
