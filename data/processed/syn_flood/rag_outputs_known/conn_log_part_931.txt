- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35821 to 133.250.97.174:16010 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a single SYN packet sent without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) showing incomplete TCP handshakes, which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for repeated incomplete handshakes; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
