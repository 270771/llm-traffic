- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.184.77:32400 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake (S0 state), which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
