- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from source 137.172.119.119 to destination 203.65.103.15 on port 800 with rapid connection attempts and zero successful completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 137.172.119.119 to 203.65.103.15:800 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood behavior due to suspicious rapid SYN attempts and connection rejections.
