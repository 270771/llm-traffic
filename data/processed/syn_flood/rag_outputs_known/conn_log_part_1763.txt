- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63919 to 163.21.12.84:9456 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source IP for potential blocking if attack persists.
