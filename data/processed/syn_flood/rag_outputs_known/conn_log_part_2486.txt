- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.234.208 on port 3306 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion on port 3306 (commonly MySQL) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the database server from resource exhaustion.
