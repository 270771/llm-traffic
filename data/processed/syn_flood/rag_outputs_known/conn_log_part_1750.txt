- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52389 to 133.250.182.88:25782 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the presence of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
