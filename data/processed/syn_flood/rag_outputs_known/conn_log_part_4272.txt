- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood attempt from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with abnormal connection behavior (high SYN rate, no established connections, RSTR flags observed).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs and presence of RSTR (reset) flags—are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
