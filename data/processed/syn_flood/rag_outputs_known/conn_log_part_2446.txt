- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.219.59 on port 8200 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection established with 44 attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.219.59 on port 8200 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect service availability.
