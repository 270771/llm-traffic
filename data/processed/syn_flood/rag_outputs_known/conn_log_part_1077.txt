- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.112.161 on port 12574 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect network resources.
