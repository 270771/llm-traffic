- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.253.167 on port 12123 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the observed SYN-only connection attempts with no handshake completion are consistent with SYN flood behavior and warrant proactive investigation.
