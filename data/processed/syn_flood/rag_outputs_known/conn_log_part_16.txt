- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.183.97 on port 21001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, many SYNs without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.183.97. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
