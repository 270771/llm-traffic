- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.173.186:2375 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN packets but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
