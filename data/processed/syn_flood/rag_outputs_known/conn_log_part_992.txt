- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:23651 to 133.118.126.60:12438 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and packet behavior (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If confirmed persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
