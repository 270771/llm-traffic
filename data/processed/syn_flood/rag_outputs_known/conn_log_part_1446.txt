- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.120 on port 4064 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.168.120 and initiate investigation to verify attack scope and source behavior.

Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the presence of multiple SYN flags without ACK responses strongly indicates a SYN flood attack pattern requiring prompt mitigation.
