- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.209.201 on port 4786 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
