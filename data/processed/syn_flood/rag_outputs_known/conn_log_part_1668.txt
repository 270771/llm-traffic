- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.166.246 on port 12127 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
