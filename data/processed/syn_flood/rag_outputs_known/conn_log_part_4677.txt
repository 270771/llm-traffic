- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.191.201 on port 37215 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior aligns with standard SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
