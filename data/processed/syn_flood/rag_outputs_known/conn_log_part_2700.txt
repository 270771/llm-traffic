- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.118.38 on port 12224 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state, 44 attempts, 1 SYN sent, 0 established connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of formal anomaly records, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
