- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44307 to 163.21.86.238:12219 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
