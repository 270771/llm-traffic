- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.120.116:8083 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, zero successful connections).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
