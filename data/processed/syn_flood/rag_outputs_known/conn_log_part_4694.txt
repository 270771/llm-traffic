- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59836 to 163.21.195.212:23128 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
