- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.108.148 on port 9663 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
