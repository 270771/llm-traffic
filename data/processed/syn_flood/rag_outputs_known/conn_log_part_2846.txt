- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.228.155:9009 with SYN packets resulting in no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—align with classic SYN flood patterns known to exhaust server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server’s availability. Initiate monitoring for additional suspicious activity from this source.
