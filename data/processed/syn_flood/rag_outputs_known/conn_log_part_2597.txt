- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 47.41.151.4 to 163.21.148.140 on port 23 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (flag S0, count 2).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from 47.41.151.4 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
