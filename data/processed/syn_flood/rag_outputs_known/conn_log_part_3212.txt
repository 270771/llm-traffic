- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:38830 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing abnormal behavior with zero successful handshakes and multiple retransmissions (RSTR flag observed).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows characteristics typical of a SYN flood: repeated connection attempts without successful handshake completion and RSTR flags indicating reset responses. This pattern is consistent with SYN flood behavior aimed at exhausting server resources on port 23 (commonly Telnet). Without explicit anomaly confirmation, a cautious but proactive investigation and mitigation is warranted.
