- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.118.206 on port 12547 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
