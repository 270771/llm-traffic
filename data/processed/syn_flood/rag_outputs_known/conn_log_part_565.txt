- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.75.192 on port 9999 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.75.192, as the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
