- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49909 to 163.21.76.124:12176 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without response (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server.
