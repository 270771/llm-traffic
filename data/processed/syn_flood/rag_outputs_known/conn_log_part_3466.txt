- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.56.65 on port 24084 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume is high or persistent, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is consistent with SYN flood behavior.
