- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.114.114 on port 50000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
