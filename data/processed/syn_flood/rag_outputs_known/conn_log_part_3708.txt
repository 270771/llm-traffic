- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.105.54 on port 12365 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
