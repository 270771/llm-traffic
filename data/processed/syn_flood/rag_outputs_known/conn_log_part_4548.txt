- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.173.143 on port 3780 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag, single SYN without completion) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
