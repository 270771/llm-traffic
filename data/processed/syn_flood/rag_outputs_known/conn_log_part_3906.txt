- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64680 to 163.21.147.31:20900 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without response (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
