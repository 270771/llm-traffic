- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.35.206 on port 873 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if confirmed, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
