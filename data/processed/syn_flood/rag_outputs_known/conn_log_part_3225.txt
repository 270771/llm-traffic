- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:15100 to 133.118.73.42:12516 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
