- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs, indicating a potential SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this behavior.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as the alert pattern is consistent with SYN flood characteristics despite lack of anomaly data.
