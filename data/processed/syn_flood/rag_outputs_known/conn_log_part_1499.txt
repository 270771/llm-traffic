- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.138.147 on port 10084 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating many half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
