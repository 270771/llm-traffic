- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40811 to 133.250.123.191:10087 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 state, 1 SYN packet, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no handshake completion). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing them. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
