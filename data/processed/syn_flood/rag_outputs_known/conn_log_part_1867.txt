- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.171.160 on port 12424 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of such packets (44) strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP protocol analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on this source for potential malicious activity.
