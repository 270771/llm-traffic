- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.14.135 on port 8069 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
