- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, followed by RSTR (reset) flags indicating connection resets.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of rapid SYNs with no handshake completion and connection resets on a sensitive port (23 - Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 and investigate source for potential blocking.
