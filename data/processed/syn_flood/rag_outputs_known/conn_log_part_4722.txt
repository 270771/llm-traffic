- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24263 to 163.21.220.143:9100 showing S0 state with zero successful handshakes and multiple failed attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates suspicious SYN flood behavior (S0 state with no handshake completion), warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
