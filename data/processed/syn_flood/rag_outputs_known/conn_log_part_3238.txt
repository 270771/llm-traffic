- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.2.48 on port 23023 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
