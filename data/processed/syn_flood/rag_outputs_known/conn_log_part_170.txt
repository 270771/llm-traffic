- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52530 to 133.118.95.124:9443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.95.124 port 9443, as the pattern of repeated SYN without completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
