- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34845 to 133.118.2.116:14402 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
