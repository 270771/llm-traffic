- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:15433 to 133.118.80.155:445 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) to port 445 (commonly targeted SMB port) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
