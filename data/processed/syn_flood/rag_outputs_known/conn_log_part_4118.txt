- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51597 to 133.118.133.10:32101 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without connection establishment (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
