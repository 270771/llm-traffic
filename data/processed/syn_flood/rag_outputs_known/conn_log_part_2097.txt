- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.13.214 on port 12140 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs without completion) align with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source for potential malicious activity.
