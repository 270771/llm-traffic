- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:38530 to 203.65.95.241:16071 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with zero established connections and repeated SYN packets strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
