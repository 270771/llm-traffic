- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.86.51 on port 8139 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. If the behavior persists, block the IP to mitigate the SYN flood attack.
