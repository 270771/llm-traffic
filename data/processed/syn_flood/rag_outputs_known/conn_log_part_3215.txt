- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47197 to 163.21.202.170:9803 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target host. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
