- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.250.160.21:7001 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern of a single SYN with no response (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Recommend rate-limiting incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
