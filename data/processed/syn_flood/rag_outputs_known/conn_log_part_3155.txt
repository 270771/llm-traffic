- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:10339 to 163.21.228.117:9226 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, zero completions) align with standard SYN flood heuristics documented in industry best practices.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system.
