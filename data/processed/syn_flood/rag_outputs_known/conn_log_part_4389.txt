- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.124.60 on ports 26091 → 16068 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No direct anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
