- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:3082 to 133.118.226.35:1911 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
