- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31383 to 133.118.6.121:55000 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristics are provided, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with multiple SYN packets and zero completions is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
