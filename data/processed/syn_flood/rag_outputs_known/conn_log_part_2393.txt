- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:22947 to 133.250.137.43:9998 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 established).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further SYN flood behavior. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server.
