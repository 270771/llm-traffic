- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:64987 to 163.21.7.205:11000 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server at 163.21.7.205. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
