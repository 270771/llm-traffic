- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31084 to 202.44.229.129:10046 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
