- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:21489 to 133.118.72.26:18113 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP analysis.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
