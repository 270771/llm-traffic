- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination IP 202.152.173.202 on port 23, showing flags consistent with SYN flood behavior (multiple SYNs, no corresponding ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential malicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to port 23 to mitigate possible SYN flood impact.
