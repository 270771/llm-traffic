- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:15939 to 133.250.183.77:9280 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
