- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.128.115 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 flag with many SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect target 163.21.128.115. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
