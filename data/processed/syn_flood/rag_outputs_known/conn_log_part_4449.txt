- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.227.121 with SYN flag set and no completion of handshake (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
