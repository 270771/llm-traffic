- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:10770 to 163.21.142.199:12167 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a high number of SYN packets (44) with no corresponding connection completions (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the pattern itself is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
