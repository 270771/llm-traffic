- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.185.181 on port 9600, characterized by numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags (S0) and connection behavior (single SYNs without completion).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
