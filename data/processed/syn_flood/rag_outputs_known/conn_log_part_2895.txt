- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.57.188 on port 52869 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection statistics strongly align with classic SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
