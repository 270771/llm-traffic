- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59560 to 133.118.154.163:12253 with SYN flag set, no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with multiple attempts (count=1, bytes=44) strongly aligns with SYN flood behavior characterized by incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
