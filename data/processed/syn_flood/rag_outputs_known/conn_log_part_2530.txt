- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.91.141 on port 3780 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of incomplete connections (44 attempts, 0 completions) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
