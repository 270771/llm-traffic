- Ping flood alert: 1641791295.511191 CY2nxhgiGc4D3pg9 93.81.158.106 17686 133.118.52.92 62078 tcp - - - - S0 F F 0 S 1 44 0 0 - 6  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID found, no heuristic or taxonomy context available to confirm this as a ping flood. The alert involves TCP flags (S0, F) rather than ICMP packets typical of ping floods, indicating this is not a classic ICMP ping flood event.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious TCP connection attempts; block if confirmed malicious. Rate-limiting ICMP is not applicable here due to lack of ICMP traffic evidence.
