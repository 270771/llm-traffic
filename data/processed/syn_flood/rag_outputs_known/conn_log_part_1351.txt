  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8008 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to lack of anomaly confirmation but clear SYN flood signature.
