- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.140.99 on port 54545 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and a high count of initial SYNs (44) with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
