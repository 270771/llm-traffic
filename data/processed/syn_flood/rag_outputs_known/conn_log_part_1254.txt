- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic, as the alert indicates classic SYN flood behavior (multiple SYNs without ACKs) targeting port 23 (Telnet), a common attack vector. Follow up with network traffic monitoring to detect any additional suspicious activity.
