- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:18499 to 163.21.175.70:9223 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server, and initiate investigation of the source IP for malicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks and warrants decisive mitigation.
