- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.132.10 on port 14330 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
