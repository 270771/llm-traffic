- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.103.51 on port 12474 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
