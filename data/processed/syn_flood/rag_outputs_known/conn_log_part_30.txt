- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8923 to 202.44.235.187:30007 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 0 responses, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero responses is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects numerous half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
