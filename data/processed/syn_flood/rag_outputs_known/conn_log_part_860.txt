- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31280 to 202.44.196.165:60021 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent (S0 state) with no response, which is a classic symptom of a SYN flood attack. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Given the nature of SYN floods, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
