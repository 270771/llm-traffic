- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:25999 to 133.118.91.227:16013 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYN packets and no handshake completion). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing them. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
