- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.227.11 on port 12000 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 completions).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.227.11 and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
