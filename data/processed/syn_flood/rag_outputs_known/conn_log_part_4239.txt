- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.89.245 on port 22 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the SSH service on port 22 from denial-of-service.
