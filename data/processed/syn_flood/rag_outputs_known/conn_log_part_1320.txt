- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60683 to 133.118.39.227:16006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP connection state definitions.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server from denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
