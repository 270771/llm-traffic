- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43629 to 202.44.193.61:12431 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
