- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61521 to 133.250.112.254:50004 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
