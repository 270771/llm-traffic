- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58529 to 163.21.243.248:30112 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as repeated SYN packets without handshake completion indicate a SYN flood pattern.
