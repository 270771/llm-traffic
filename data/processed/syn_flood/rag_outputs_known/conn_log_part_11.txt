- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.245.192:10443 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to 163.21.245.192:10443 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
