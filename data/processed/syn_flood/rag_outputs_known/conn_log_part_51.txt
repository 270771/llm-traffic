- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2079 to 133.118.227.113:12217 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (S0 state with 44 packets sent, 0 established connections).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target 133.118.227.113. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
