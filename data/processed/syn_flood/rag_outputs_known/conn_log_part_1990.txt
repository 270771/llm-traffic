- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14012 to 203.65.50.139:21291 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
