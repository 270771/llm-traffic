- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.218.15 on port 143 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag pattern is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where many SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
