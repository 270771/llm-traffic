- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 (source port 29011) targeting 133.118.106.8 (destination port 9191) with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.106.8 on port 9191 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent, as the SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without ACKs) is a well-known denial-of-service technique.
