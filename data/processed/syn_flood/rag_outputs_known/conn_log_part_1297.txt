- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.86.237 on port 3260 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood activity, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
