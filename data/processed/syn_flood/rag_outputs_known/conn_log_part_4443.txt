- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.198.253 on port 7634 shows SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
