- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.136.118 on port 12107 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
