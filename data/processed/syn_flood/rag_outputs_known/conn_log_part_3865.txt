- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:17216 to 163.21.48.100:12183 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target host. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
