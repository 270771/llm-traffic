- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.22.219 on port 4506 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
