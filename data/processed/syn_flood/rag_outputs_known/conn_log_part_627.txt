- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.40.164 on port 12461 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s characteristics (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
