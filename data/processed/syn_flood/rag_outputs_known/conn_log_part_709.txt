- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 targeting destination IP 163.21.139.98 on port 10256, characterized by numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag pattern (SYN sent, no response) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker overwhelms the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
