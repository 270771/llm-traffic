- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.101.42 on port 48013 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating an incomplete handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
