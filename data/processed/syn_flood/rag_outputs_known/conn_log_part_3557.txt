- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.126.137:55554 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 flags typically indicate incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
