- Ping flood alert: 1641790994.806243 CRpWa52sYE1hRfA6v7 93.81.158.106 24858 → 133.250.74.128 8649 tcp S0 flags set, 44 packets, no anomalies recorded.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to confirm this as a ping flood. The traffic is TCP with SYN (S0) flags, not ICMP ping traffic, and no matching anomaly or heuristic context is available.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious TCP SYN flood behavior; consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as SYN flood. No direct evidence of ICMP ping flood here.
