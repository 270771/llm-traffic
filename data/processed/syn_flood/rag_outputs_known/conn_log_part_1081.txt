- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30802 to 203.65.119.94:1962 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and immediate REJ (reject) responses, indicating connection initiation without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity; implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from this IP to protect target 203.65.119.94:1962 until further analysis.
