- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.148.114 on port 4443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator; immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion.
