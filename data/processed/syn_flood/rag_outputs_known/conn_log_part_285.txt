- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.176.6 on port 49 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature.
