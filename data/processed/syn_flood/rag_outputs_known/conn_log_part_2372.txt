- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26312 to 133.118.243.222:1433 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) to a sensitive port (1433, commonly MS SQL) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
