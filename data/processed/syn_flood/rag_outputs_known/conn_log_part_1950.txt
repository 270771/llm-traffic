- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high source port 63839 targeting destination 8.34.37.255 port 80 with TCP flags indicating SYN and high packet rate (0.906659) and 490 packets sent, no established connections (0 ACKs), flagged as SH (SYN+ACK+RST) and SADF (SYN attack detection flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—high volume of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, targeting a common service port (80), and the presence of SYN attack detection flags—are consistent with known SYN flood attack patterns.
  → Action: Block source IP 157.161.40.85 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate upstream for potential compromised hosts.
