  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
