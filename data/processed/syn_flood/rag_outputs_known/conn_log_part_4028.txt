- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56333 to 163.21.218.112:45005 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 45005 to mitigate impact.
