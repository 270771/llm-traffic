- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.199.129 on port 5007 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
