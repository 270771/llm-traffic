- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54806 to 133.118.5.114:49443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
