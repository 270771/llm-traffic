- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28693 to 202.44.207.186:79 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake, overwhelming the target port 79.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
