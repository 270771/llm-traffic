- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:30196 to 133.250.97.128:30468 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection establishment (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
