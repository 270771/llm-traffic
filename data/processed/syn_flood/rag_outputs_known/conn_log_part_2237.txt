- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28821 to 163.21.53.227:1521 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 163.21.53.227. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
