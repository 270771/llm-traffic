- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:51757 to 163.21.150.65:12902 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0 state, single SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
