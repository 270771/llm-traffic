- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:51729 to 133.118.173.191:18003 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, no connection established, single SYN packet count) align with classic SYN flood characteristics where the attacker sends SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
