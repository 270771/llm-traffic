- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.127.73 on port 12109 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous SYN packets without responses (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
