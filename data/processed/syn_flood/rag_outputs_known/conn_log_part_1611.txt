- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57024 to 133.118.102.69:10240 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without handshake completion overwhelm the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target server.
