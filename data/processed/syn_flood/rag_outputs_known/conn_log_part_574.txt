- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.17.46 on port 2083 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately due to clear SYN flood pattern (SYN packets sent without completion), which exhausts server resources and disrupts service.
