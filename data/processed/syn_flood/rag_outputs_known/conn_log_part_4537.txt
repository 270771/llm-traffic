- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22421 to 203.65.37.206:12376 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes, overwhelming target resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
