- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.220.219 on port 7657 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
