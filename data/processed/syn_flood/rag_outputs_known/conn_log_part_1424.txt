- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20495 to 202.44.196.229:32101 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone indicates a SYN flood pattern (SYN sent without completion), but confirmation requires further monitoring or correlation with additional data.
