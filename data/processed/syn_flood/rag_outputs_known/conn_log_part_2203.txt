- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.118.83.76:2121 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s SYN-only connection attempts with zero completions (S0) and multiple SYN packets (count=44) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server 133.118.83.76:2121 from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
