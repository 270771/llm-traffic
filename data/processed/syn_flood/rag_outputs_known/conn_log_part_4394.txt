- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 133.118.247.24:443 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
