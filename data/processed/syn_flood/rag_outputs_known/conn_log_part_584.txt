- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.146.81 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
