- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.230.142 on port 30002 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to port 30002 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
