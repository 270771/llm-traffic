- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:19291 to 133.118.194.239:1883 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) align with classic SYN flood characteristics as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server.
