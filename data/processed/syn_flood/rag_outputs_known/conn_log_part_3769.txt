- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.60.14 on port 8728 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security understanding.
  → Action: Block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.118.60.14 and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.
