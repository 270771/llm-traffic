- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 initiated a TCP connection flood against destination 163.21.35.203 on port 10443, with numerous SYN packets and no completed handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
