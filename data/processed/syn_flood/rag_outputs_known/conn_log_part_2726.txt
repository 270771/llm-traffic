- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:42763 to 133.118.136.239:16092 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with a single SYN packet and no established connection is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior, as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
