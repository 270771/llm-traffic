- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.1.143 on port 16993 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, which overwhelms target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
