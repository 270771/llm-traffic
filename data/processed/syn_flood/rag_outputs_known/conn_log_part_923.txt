- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.24.223 on port 10066 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in many half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to port 10066 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement SYN cookies or other TCP stack hardening to mitigate half-open connection exhaustion.
