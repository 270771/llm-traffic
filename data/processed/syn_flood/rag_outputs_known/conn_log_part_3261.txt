- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.150.16 on port 9245 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood patterns emerge.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood indicators—multiple SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 flag) and a high count (44). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks aiming to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
