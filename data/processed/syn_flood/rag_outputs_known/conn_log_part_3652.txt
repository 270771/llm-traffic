- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.220.133 on port 3780 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and monitor for further suspicious activity.
