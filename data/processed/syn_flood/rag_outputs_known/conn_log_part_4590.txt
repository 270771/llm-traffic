- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:15188 to 163.21.169.205:3299 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 163.21.169.205:3299, as the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a well-known attack signature.
