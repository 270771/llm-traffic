- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31741 to 163.21.7.28:12106 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood attacks, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
