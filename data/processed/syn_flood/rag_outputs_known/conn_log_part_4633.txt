- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24520 to 202.44.204.242:3310 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood behavior and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of SYN flood emerges.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake (S0), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. However, without anomaly records or heuristic context, confirmation is limited. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
