- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:9328 to 133.118.16.52:8200 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target 133.118.16.52. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
