- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13890 to 202.44.230.11:21254 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
