- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21099 to 133.250.186.195:12269 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
