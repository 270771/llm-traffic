- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.78.111:50050 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
