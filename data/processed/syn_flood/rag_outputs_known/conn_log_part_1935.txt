- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.58.161 on port 47080 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
