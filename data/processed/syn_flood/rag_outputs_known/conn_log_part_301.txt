- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.51.64:5601 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 203.65.51.64:5601 and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.
