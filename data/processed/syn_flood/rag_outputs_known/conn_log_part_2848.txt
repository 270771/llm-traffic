- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.229.72 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and zero completed connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
