- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53140 to 163.21.213.149:18092 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
