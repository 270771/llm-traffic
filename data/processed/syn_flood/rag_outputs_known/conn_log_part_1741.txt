- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:30840 to 133.118.91.115:20053 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.91.115. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
