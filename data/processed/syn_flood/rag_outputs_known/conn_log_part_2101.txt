- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:15402 to 133.118.68.227:10005 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
