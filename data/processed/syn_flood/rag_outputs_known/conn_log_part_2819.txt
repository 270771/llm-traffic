- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26977 to 203.65.52.166:143 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert flags (S0 state, single SYN packet, no response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
