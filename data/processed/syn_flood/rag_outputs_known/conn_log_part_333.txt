- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:34995 to 133.118.234.148:12219 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and zero established connections strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack characteristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
