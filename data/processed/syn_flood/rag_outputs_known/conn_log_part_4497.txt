- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:27199 to 203.65.59.62:12503 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristics, the presence of a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or connection completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target.
