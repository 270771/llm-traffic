- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 15433 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 163.21.120.234 on port 445, resulting in multiple half-open connections (S0 state) with no completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) to a sensitive port (445) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
