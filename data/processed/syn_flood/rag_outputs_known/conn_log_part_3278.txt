- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.49.27 on port 8081 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, which overwhelm target resources by exhausting connection queues.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 8081 to mitigate impact.
