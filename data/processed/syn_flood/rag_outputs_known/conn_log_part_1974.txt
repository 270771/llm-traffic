- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.124.184 on port 12333 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, many SYNs without completion) aligns with standard SYN flood behavior known in cybersecurity.  
  → Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
