- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.14.9 on port 16086 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
