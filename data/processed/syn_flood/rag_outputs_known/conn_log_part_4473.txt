- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:12659 to 133.118.234.151:46001 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—multiple SYN packets (44) with no connection establishment (S0 state). This pattern is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing handshakes. Without anomaly data, a cautious investigation and potential mitigation is warranted.
