- Ping flood alert: 1641791079.986484	CLBrcm1y4VDkqYHsr6	167.249.133.167	16337	163.21.133.48	12209	tcp	-	-	-	-	S0	F	F	0	S	1	44	0	0	-	6  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available to confirm or explain this behavior as a ping flood attack. The alert involves TCP traffic with S0 flags (connection attempt without response), which is inconsistent with ICMP ping flood characteristics.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious TCP connection attempts; apply standard TCP anomaly detection and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed malicious. No direct ICMP ping flood action recommended based on current data.
