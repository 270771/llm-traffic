- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53374 to 133.118.248.211:25006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
