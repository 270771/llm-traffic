- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:5102 to 133.250.137.209:21260 showing a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK or response) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
