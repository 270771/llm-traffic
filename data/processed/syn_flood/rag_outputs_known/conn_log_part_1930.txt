- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.254.243 on port 9943 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
