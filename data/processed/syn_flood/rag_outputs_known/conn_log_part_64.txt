- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55679 to 133.250.181.65:10080 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
