- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.31.243:52869 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack volume persists.
