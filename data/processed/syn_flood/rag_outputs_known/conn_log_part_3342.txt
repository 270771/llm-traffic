- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.233.16:7989 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are definitive indicators of a SYN flood attack as they represent half-open connections exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on port 7989 to mitigate the SYN flood impact. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
