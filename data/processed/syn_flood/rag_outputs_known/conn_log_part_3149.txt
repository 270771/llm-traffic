- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 44201 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 202.152.173.202 port 23, with a high rate (0.754370) and no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high SYN rate with no handshake completion and RSTR responses strongly indicate a SYN flood attempt targeting port 23 (Telnet). Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the Telnet service.
