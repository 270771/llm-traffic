  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic volume is high or persistent, as the pattern of SYN packets without connection completion is indicative of a SYN flood attack.
