- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.60.101 on port 12531 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
