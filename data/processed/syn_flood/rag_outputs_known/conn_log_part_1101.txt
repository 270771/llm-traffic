  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood patterns; escalate for manual investigation due to lack of automated anomaly confirmation.
