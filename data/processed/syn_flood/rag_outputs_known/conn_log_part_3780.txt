- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 47.41.151.4 to 163.21.148.140 on port 23 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 40 bytes sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 47.41.151.4 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone suggests suspicious SYN-only traffic consistent with SYN flood behavior, warranting proactive investigation and mitigation.
