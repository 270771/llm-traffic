- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.86.170:2086 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection count (1 SYN, 44 attempts) strongly align with SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
