- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:25653 to 202.44.219.233:9418 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristics, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target server.
