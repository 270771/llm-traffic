- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.249.41 on port 12175 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the SYN-only packet with no completion of the TCP handshake, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if the volume persists or escalates.
