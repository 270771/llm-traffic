- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.236.30 on port 15084 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern. However, the S0 flag and connection statistics (1 attempt, 44 packets, 0 completions) strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP anomaly definitions.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
