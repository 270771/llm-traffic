- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.147.127 on port 9765 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
