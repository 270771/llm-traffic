- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:19962 to 163.21.169.143:16082 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a SYN flood pattern (S0 flag with no completed connections and multiple SYN attempts). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing the handshake. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
