- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.185.7 on port 11300 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
