- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.177.6:50070 with SYN packets but no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood behavior is indicated by incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state) causing resource exhaustion.
