- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.183.75:4567 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and multiple attempts (44 packets) strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
