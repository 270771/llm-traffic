- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:57643 to 163.21.116.40:18016 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet flags.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
