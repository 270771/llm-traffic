- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:13069 to 133.118.210.94:9861 shows S0 flag with zero bytes transferred, indicating a SYN sent but no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as SYN flood behavior.
