- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.223.10 on port 16009 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
