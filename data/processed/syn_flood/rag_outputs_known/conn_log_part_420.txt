- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.195.195 on port 10001 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag, no connection completion) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
