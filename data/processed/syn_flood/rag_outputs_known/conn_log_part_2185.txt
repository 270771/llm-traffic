- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.77.1 on port 9682 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
