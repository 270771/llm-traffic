  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact, as the pattern of numerous SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate investigation on source and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
