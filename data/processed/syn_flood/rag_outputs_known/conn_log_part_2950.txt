- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45194 to 133.118.119.63:12380 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0 state with SYN sent but no ACK received) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
