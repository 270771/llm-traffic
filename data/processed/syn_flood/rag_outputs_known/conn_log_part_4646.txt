- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9621 to 133.250.90.26:48888 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.90.26. Initiate further investigation on source behavior.
