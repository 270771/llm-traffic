- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 immediately and apply rate-limiting or block if SYN flood behavior persists, as the alert alone indicates a classic SYN flood pattern targeting port 23 (Telnet), which is a common attack vector.
