- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.173.11 on port 4321 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
