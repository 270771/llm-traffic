- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44025 to 203.65.43.67:21233 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
