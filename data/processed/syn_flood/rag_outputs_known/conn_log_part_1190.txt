- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.91.234 on port 1433 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the S0 flag in TCP connection states is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on port 1433.
