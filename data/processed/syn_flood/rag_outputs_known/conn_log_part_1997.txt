- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.202.108 on port 9151 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed SYN flood pattern (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source further.
