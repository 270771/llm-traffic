- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:60398 to 133.250.85.57:12437 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
