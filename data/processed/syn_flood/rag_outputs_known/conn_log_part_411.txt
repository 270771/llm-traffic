- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.41.66 on port 2455 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 2455 and initiate investigation of source IP for potential SYN flood activity. Implement SYN cookies or other TCP stack hardening to mitigate impact.
