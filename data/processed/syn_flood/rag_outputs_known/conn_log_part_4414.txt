- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.37.178 on port 4443 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
