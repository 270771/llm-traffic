- Ping flood alert: 1641791142.714256 Cs1MUUciQKQ6kSyK9 93.81.158.106 19330 133.118.147.95 11112 tcp - - - - S0 F F 0 S 1 44 0 0 - 6  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found, no heuristic context available to confirm this as a ping flood. The alert shows TCP flags (S0, F, F) rather than ICMP traffic, which is inconsistent with a classic ICMP ping flood pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious TCP connection attempts and consider blocking or rate-limiting if confirmed malicious, but do not treat as an ICMP ping flood without further evidence.
