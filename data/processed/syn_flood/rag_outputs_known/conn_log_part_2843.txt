- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31571 to 133.250.103.91:12199 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero established connections are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
