- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:9821 to 202.44.253.241:35524 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with SYN packets and zero completions is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
