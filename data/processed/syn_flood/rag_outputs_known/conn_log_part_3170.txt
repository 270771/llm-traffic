- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.98.190 on port 3780 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
