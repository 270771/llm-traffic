- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.195.124 on port 9203 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0, indicating SYN sent but no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the presence of a SYN packet without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
