- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:7188 to 133.118.35.6:12486 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern, as SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 12486 to mitigate impact.
