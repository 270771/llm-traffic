- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.16.210 on port 21298 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for malicious activity.
