- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.60.3 on port 12450 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard network security practice.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
