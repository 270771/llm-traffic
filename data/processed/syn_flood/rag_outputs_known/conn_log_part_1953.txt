- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.11.45:16993 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
