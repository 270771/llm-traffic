- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:30909 to 133.250.155.217:14147 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server.
