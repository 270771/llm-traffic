- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.58.87 on port 4899 show SYN packets without completing handshakes (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
