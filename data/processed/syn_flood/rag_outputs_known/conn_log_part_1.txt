- Ping flood alert: CLXWSD1u6IAN4wdOS3 from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.128.16 on TCP port 10934 with S0 flag and 44 packets.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting or blocking if flood behavior persists.

Explanation: Although no matching anomaly or heuristic context is available to confirm this as a classic ICMP ping flood, the alert shows a high volume of TCP SYN packets (S0 flag) with no response, which is consistent with a SYN flood or scanning behavior. Immediate investigation and traffic control are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
