- SYN flood alert: High volume of TCP SYN packets (1503) from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 163.21.125.97 on port 21515, with TCP flag S0 indicating SYN packets without completion of handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a SYN flood attack, as the volume and TCP flags strongly indicate SYN flood behavior despite lack of anomaly data.
