- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.250.238 on port 3000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic and well-documented indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
