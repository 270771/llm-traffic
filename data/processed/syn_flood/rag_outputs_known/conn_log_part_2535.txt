- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.72.132:5000 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 flag, 44 packets, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern (numerous SYN packets with no completions) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
