- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46253 to 133.118.251.118:9939 showing S0 flag with 1 attempt and 44 packets, indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of S0 flag with multiple packets and zero completions is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
