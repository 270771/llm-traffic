- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:6707 to 203.65.119.40:502 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) align with classic SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
