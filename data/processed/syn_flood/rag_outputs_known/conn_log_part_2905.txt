- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 20217 is sending TCP SYN packets to destination 203.65.64.148 on port 8333, resulting in numerous half-open connections (S0 state) with no established sessions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
