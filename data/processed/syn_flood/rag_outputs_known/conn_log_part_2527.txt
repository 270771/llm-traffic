- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.40.201 on port 9151 with SYN packets sent but no established connections (S0 flag, 44 attempts, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect server availability.
