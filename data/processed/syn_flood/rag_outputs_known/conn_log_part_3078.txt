- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:38673 to 133.250.114.15:14006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
