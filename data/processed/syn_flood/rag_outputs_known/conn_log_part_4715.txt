- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59811 to 203.65.116.213:12529 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets without completing handshake—is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
