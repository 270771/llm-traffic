- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14344 to 133.118.232.176:10390 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), 44 SYN packets sent with zero responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect resources.
