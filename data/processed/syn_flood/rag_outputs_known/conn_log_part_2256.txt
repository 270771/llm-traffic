- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.43.160 on port 10002 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.43.160. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
