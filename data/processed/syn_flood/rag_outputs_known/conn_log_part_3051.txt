- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.104.229 on port 3541 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
