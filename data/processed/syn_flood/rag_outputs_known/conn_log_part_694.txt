- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.150.239 on port 1433 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood heuristics documented in standard cybersecurity practice—specifically, repeated SYNs without handshake completion overwhelm target resources.
  → Action: Block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server on port 1433 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
