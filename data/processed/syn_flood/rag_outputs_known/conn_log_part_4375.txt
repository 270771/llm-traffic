- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.114.85:8098 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for unusual connection patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows a single SYN without completion, which is suspicious but insufficient to confirm a SYN flood attack. Proactive investigation and monitoring are warranted.
