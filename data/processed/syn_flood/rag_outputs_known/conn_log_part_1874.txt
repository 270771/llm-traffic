- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.51.243 on port 8880 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern are textbook indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
