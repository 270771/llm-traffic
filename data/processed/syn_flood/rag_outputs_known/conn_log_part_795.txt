- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in RSTR (reset) responses and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without established connections and immediate resets is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, consistent with known TCP SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target system.
