- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.119.219 on port 9797 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s SYN flood signature (S0 flag, many SYNs, zero completions) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server.
