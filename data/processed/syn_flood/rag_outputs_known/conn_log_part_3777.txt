- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13577 to 133.250.108.251:10022 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets without completion) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.108.251 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
