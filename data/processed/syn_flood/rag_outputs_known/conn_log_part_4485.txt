- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:13737 to 133.250.102.203:18030 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple failed attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
