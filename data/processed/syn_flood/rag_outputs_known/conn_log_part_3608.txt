- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.97.33 on port 18038 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
