- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 133.250.176.150:33060 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
