- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:16487 to 133.250.138.49:12345 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) strongly align with known SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN packets without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the IP to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
