- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.239.91 on port 12419 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag set), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
