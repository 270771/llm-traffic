- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.129.28 on port 16401 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
