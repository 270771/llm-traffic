- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.118.72.100:8009 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of initial SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
