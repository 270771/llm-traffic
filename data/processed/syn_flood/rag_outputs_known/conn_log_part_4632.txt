- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.121.208 on port 18081 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (S0 state with SYN packets sent but no handshake completion). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating connections without completing them. Without anomaly records or heuristics, a cautious investigation and potential mitigation is warranted.
