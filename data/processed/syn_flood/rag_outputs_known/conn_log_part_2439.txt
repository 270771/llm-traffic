- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.158.94 on port 8880 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to port 8880 and monitor for further suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion.
