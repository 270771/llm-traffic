- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.18.42 on port 62078 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
