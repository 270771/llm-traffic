- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.12.71 on port 12405 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and a count of 44 SYNs with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
