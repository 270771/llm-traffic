- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.107.218 on port 2761 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator; immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for escalation.
