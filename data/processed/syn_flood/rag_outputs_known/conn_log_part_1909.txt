- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.240.24 on port 10001 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and only 1 SYN sent with no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood, as the connection pattern (S0 flag with no handshake completion) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks. Investigate source further for malicious intent.
