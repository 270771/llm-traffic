- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47167 to 133.118.137.5:10256 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (connection attempt sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target system.
