- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.9.143 on port 1741, characterized by a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s signature (numerous SYN packets without handshake completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, which exhausts server resources by half-opening connections.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious intent.
