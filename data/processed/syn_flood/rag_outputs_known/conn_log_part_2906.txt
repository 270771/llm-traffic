- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 163.21.87.83:22629 to 192.103.164.17:636 showing OTH flag with 1 SYN packet and 60 bytes transferred, indicating incomplete handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of OTH flag with minimal packets and no handshake completion aligns with known SYN flood characteristics—excessive SYNs without ACKs to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 163.21.87.83 and monitor for further SYN flood patterns. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
