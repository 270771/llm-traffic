- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.151.96 on port 17010 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 133.250.151.96.
