- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.220.251:8069 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with multiple SYN attempts and no handshake completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target server.
