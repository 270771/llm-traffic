- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59627 to 133.118.43.135:12566 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 44 bytes, no ACK).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the source IP to protect the target.
