- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.58.154 on port 5010 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood, as repeated SYNs without handshake completion are a classic SYN flood signature. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
