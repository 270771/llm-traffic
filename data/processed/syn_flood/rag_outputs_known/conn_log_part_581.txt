- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:15208 to 133.118.167.115:13443 showing S0 flag with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristics, the presence of an S0 flag with a single SYN and no handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential resource exhaustion.
