- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.136.14 on port 12373 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated half-open connections and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood attacks typically involve numerous incomplete TCP handshakes to exhaust server resources.
