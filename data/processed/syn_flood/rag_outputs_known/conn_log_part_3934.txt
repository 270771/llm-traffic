- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on high ephemeral port 11284 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 163.21.65.149 port 135, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 135, as the pattern of repeated SYNs without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
