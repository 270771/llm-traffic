- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 133.250.97.243:8880 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero established connections are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks in TCP traffic analysis.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
