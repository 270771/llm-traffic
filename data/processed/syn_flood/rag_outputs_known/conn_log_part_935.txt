- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.90.133 on port 12423 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without ACKs) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
