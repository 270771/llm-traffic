- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.178.184 on port 10075 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs, no ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further resource exhaustion on the target server.
