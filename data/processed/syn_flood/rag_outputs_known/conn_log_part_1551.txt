- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.162.216 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate, but the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect target resources.
