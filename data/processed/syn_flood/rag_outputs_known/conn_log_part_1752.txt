- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.56.104 on port 45786 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
