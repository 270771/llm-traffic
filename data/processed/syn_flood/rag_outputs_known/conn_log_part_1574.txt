- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.91.102 on port 30479 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYNs but does not complete the handshake, exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
