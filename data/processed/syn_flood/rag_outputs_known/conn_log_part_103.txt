- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 60118 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating RSTR (Reset Received) and very low response time (0.254528s), showing repeated connection attempts (Shr count 1, 60 attempts, 104 packets).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood based on structured data or heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of rapid connection attempts to port 23 with reset responses strongly indicates a SYN flood or scanning attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 107.81.9.228 and blocking if behavior persists to protect Telnet service from denial-of-service impact.
