- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28693 to 133.118.30.143:9042 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server.
