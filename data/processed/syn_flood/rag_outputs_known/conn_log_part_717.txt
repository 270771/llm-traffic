- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.87.187 on port 23 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0) indicating half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service on port 23.
