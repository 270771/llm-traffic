- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:39550 to 163.21.75.218:12118 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 163.21.75.218. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
