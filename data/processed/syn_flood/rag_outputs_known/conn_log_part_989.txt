- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.135.91 on port 1723 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server.
