- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.49.3 on port 11000 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and connection pattern strongly align with SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
