- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.183.58 on port 10001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero completed handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
