- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.145.27 on port 9199 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target system.
