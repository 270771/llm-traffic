- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.0.166 on port 30017 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated half-open connections and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood attacks typically manifest as numerous incomplete TCP handshakes causing resource exhaustion.
