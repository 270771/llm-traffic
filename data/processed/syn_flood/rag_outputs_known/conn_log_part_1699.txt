- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228:46758 to 202.152.173.202:23 show suspicious behavior with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) flags, indicating connection refusals consistent with SYN flood patterns.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23 and initiate investigation on source IP for potential SYN flood activity.
