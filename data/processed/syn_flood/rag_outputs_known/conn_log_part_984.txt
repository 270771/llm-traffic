- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6982 to 133.118.222.167:21257 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 44 bytes, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records or heuristic context, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
