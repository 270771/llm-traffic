- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.125.150 on port 16667 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.125.150. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
