- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.197.169 on port 3388 shows a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN-only connection with no handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
