- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.105.136 on port 9000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the alert’s pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack signatures.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
