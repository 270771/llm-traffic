- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.198.208:9943 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no reply) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects numerous incomplete connection attempts overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
