- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.81.248 on port 35000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags (S0) and connection behavior (single SYN, no response).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
