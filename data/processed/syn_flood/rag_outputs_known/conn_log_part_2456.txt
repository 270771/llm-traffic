- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.24.128 on port 4664 show SYN packets with no completion of handshake (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without ACK responses) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the TCP handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
