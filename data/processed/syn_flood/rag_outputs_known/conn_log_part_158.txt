- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.78.21 on port 5672 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no reply) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows numerous half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
