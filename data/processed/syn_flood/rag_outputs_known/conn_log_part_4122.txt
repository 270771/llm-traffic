- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.24.192 on port 2083 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing the TCP handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and maintain service availability. Investigate the source for further malicious activity.
