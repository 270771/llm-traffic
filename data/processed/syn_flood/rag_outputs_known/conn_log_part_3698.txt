- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.11.108 on port 12391 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection state (S0), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks where SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
