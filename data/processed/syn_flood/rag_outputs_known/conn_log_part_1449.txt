- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.152.169.91 on port 5432 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and multiple retransmissions, resulting in REJ (reject) responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with no completions and REJ responses strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target service.
