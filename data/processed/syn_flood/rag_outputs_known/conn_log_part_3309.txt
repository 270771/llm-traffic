- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48241 to 133.250.64.254:18056 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with zero completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.250.64.254. Initiate further investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
