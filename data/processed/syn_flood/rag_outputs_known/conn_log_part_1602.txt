- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59099 to 203.65.64.63:12416 with SYN packets resulting in no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
