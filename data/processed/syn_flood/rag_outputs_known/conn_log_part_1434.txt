- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.195.188 on port 3000 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
