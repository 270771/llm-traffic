- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.245.49 on port 80 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the TCP flag pattern S0 is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further malicious activity.
