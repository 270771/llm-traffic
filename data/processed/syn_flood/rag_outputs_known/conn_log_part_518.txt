- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs, indicating a potential SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this behavior explicitly.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 and initiate investigation of the source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the alert’s characteristics—multiple SYN packets without completion of TCP handshake—are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns and warrant proactive mitigation.
