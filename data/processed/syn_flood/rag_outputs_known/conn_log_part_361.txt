- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.65.203 on port 25 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the mail server on port 25.
