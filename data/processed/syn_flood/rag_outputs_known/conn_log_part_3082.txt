- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.188.57 on port 35000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 1, bytes 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
