- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.117.170 on port 12589 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
