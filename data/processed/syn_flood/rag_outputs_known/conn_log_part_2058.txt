- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.33.184 on port 14400 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, flagged as S0 (connection attempt sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert indicates a classic SYN flood pattern (S0 flag), where SYN packets are sent but no handshake completes. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the S0 flag is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted to prevent service disruption.
