- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56109 to 133.118.220.70:21300 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it reflects incomplete TCP handshakes designed to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
