- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.214.31 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection behavior alone are definitive indicators of SYN flood activity.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect network resources.
