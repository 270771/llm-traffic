- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.17.226 on port 55554 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
