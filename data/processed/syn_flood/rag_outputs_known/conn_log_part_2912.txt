- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:31802 to 133.118.75.153:993 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and high SYN count with zero completions are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if attack persists.
