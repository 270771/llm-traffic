- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.164.66 on port 10001 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to port 10001 and monitor for further SYN flood patterns; escalate for manual investigation due to lack of anomaly context but presence of SYN-only connection attempts indicative of SYN flood behavior.
