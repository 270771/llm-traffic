- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.28.105 on port 12136 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known SYN flood pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target system.
