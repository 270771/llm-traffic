- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40649 to 133.250.98.207:50500 resulted in a SYN packet with no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN packet with no handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
