- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.59.132 on port 4911 show a pattern of connection attempts with no established sessions (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection pattern (S0, many attempts, zero completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
