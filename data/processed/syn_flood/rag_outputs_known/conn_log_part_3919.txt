- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.49.164 on port 6668 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK received), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks aimed at exhausting server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.
