- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21740 to 133.250.106.181:9919 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 1 connection attempt and 44 bytes transferred, indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the S0 flag with zero completed handshakes is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack pattern, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
