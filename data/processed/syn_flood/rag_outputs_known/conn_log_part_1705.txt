- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.57.209 on port 18081 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 packets sent and 0 responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server at 203.65.57.209. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
