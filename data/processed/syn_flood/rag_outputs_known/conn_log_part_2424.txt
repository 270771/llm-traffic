- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:65183 to 133.250.89.186:37215 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
