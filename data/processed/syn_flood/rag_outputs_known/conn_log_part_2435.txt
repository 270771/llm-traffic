- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.237.43 on port 83 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
