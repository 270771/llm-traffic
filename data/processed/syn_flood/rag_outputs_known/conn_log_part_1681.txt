- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.186.188 on port 4369 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or established connection (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshake typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
