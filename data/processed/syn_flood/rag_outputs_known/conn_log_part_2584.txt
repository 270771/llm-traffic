- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.211.130 on port 9213 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) are textbook indicators of SYN flood attacks, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
