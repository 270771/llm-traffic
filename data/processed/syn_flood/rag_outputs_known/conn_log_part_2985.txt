- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.13.62 on port 9734 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (S0 flag, single SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the flood persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
