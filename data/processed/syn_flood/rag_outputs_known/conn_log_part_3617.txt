- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.112.213 on port 5025 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in TCP/IP networking.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if sustained, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
