- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.37.207 on port 35559 showing S0 state with zero successful handshakes and multiple failed SYN attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for suspicious activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if SYN flood behavior persists, as multiple SYN attempts without handshake completion strongly indicate a SYN flood attack.
