- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.163.102 on port 12559 with SYN packets sent but no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with SYN packets sent and no response completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
