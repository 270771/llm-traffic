- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37815 to 163.21.131.38:21245 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target. Initiate further monitoring for similar behavior.
