- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59238 to 133.250.78.149:12322 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential malicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to 133.250.78.149:12322 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
