- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.2.233 on port 12274 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the suspected SYN flood attack. Initiate investigation on source IP for further threat assessment.
