- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54157 to 133.118.106.115:16016 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests but does not complete the TCP handshake, exhausting server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets to 133.118.106.115:16016 to mitigate the SYN flood impact.
