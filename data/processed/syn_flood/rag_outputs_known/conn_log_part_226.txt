- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 203.65.124.150 on ports 46922 → 21288, with multiple SYN packets sent but no connection established (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm or explain this detection.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to verify if this is a coordinated SYN flood attack, as the SYN flood pattern (many SYNs without ACKs) is a known threat behavior disrupting service availability.
