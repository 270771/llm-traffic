- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 133.250.115.26 on port 12416 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.
