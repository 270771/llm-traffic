- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 54126 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 with TCP SYN flags and a very short inter-arrival time (4.95 ms), sending 4 packets with no responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 107.81.9.228 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics: rapid SYN packets to a single destination port (23, Telnet) with no corresponding ACKs or responses, indicating a likely SYN flood attempt. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
