- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:18229 to 163.21.179.251:3260 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and zero completed connections are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Investigate source IP for further malicious activity.
