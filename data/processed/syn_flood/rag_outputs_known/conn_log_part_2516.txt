- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.118.238:9944 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0) and a high count of SYNs without completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts, as the pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (SYNs without ACKs) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
