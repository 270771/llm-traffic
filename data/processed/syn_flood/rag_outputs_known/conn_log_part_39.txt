- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:57088 to 163.21.116.113:65432 showing S0 state with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 state with repeated SYNs and no connection completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target.
