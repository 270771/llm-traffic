- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:62130 to 163.21.239.130:12340 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack persists.
