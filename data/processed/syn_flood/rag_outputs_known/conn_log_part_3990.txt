- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN flags and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and initiate network traffic monitoring for similar patterns, as the presence of repeated SYN flags without handshake completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attack aiming to exhaust server resources.
