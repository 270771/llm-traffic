- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.96.250 on port 2087 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (S0 state with multiple SYNs and zero completions) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target server.
