- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.41.152 on port 20512 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, and initiate investigation on source behavior due to classic SYN flood signature (many SYNs without handshake completion).
