- SYN flood alert: Source IP 107.81.9.228 on high source port 46272 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 port 23 (Telnet) with TCP flags indicating SYN flood pattern (SH, F, F, 0, F, 1, 40).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets targeting Telnet port—is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service on port 23 and investigate source for further malicious activity.
