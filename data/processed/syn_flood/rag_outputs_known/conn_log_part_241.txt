- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.223.164 on port 16000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high count of such packets (44 attempts with zero completions) strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
