- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.16.63:5357 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
