- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44585 to 133.118.106.204:12307 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack.
