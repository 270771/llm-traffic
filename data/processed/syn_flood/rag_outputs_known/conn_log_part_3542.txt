- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:27457 to 163.21.124.5:9447 showing S0 state with zero successful connections and multiple failed SYN attempts.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood signature (S0 state with no established connections).
