- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.74.129 on port 9051 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by multiple S0 flags and zero data transfer.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, the alert alone shows classic SYN flood characteristics (many SYNs, no ACKs), justifying investigation and mitigation steps.
