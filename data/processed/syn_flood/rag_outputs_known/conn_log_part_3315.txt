- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.228.149 on port 264 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
