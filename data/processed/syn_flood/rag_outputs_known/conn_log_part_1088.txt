- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.150.12 on port 3001 show numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of multiple SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with connection requests.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
