- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.149.176 on port 14875 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood pattern.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the observed behavior (numerous SYNs without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
