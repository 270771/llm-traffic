- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40978 to 203.65.36.235:49694 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no response or completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service. Initiate investigation on source IP reputation and network logs.
