- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:30139 to 133.250.129.125:2181 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends many SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
