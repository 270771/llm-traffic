- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45333 to 133.118.165.14:18082 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
