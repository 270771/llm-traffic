- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.22.162 on ports 11711 → 12219 shows S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where the attacker sends numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect target 203.65.22.162 from resource exhaustion.
