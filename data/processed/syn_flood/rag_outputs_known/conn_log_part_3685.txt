- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53077 to 133.118.131.172:21321 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
