- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.26.42 on port 21250 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, causing resource exhaustion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
