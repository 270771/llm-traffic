- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26459 to 202.152.172.144:4911 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, multiple SYNs with no ACK) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
