- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.88.103 on port 18081 show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source IP for potential blocking if attack persists.
