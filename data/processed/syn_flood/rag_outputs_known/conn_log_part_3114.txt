- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37196 to 133.118.158.222:12370 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (SYN sent, no response) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, where numerous SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
