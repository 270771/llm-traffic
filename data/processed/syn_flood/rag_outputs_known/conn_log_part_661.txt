- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:26273 to 133.250.133.214:18017 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If flooding persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
