- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.225.9:21025 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and one SYN packet sent.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag with zero established connections is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
