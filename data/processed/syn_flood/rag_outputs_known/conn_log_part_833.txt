- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:17313 to 202.129.9.72:465 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
