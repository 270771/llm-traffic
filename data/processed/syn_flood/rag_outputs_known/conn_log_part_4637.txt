- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.107.227 on port 44303 shows S0 flag with 44 SYN packets sent and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag indicates SYN packets sent without any response or session establishment, a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
