- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful handshakes and multiple RST responses, indicating connection resets.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no established connections and RST flags is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the Telnet service on port 23.
