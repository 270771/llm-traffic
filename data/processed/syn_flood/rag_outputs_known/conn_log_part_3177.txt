- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58852 to 133.118.71.166:9804 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet behavior (S0 state with SYN sent but no ACK received).  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
