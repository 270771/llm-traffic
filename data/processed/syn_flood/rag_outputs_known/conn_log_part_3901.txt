- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.42.143 on port 1962 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
