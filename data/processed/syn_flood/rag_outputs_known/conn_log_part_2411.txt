- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:31167 to 133.118.1.175:10006 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet with no follow-up ACKs strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP connection state analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.1.175. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential malicious activity.
