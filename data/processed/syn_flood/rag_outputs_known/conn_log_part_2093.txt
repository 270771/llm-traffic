- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.44.124 on port 9312 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 attempts with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
