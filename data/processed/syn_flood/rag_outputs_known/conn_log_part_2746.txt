- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:24880 to 163.21.130.35:1723 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm this pattern explicitly. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without response) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service. Investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
