- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:14689 to 133.118.184.39:12455 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found, no heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records and heuristic context, the presence of numerous SYN packets without any connection completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
