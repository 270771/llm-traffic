- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6233 to 133.118.3.204:12303 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F flags, zero established connections) are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks as they represent numerous SYN requests without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server 133.118.3.204.
