- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.232.218 on port 4848 show numerous SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and high count of incomplete connections (44 attempts with zero completions) strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 133.118.232.218 on port 4848 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
