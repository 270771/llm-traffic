- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.41.88 on port 12337 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without completion strongly align with SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
