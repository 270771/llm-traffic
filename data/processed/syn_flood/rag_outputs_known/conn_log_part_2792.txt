- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:28693 to 203.65.58.13:70 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, SYN sent but no response) and connection pattern strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practices.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
