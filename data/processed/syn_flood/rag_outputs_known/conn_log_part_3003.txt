- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49256 to 163.21.24.203:12294 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection statistics (1 SYN sent, 0 established) align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target 163.21.24.203 from resource exhaustion and prevent denial of service.
