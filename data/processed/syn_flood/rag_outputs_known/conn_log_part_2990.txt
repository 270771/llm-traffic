- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:6888 to 163.21.176.6:21270 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
