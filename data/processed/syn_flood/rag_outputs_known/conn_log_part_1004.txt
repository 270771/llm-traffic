- Ping flood alert: 1641791109.242484 from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.213.26 on TCP port 1434.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID found, no heuristic or taxonomy context available.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for suspicious activity and monitor traffic patterns; consider rate-limiting or blocking if flood behavior persists.

Explanation: The alert indicates a potential flood event but lacks corroborating anomaly data or heuristic context to definitively classify it as a ping flood attack. The protocol is TCP, not ICMP, which is atypical for a ping flood. Therefore, proactive investigation and monitoring are warranted before taking blocking actions.
