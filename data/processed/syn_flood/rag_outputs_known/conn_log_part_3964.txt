- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.216.217:8083 shows SYN flood characteristics with S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), 44 connection attempts, and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of incomplete SYN attempts (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.216.217. Initiate further investigation on source behavior.
