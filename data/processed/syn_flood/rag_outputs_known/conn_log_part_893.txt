- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:61761 to 163.21.51.148:9810 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a SYN flood based on known patterns.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets without completion strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.51.148. Initiate further investigation on source behavior.
