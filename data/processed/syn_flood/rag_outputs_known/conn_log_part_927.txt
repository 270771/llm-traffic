- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.107.32 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion, flagged as S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated incomplete TCP handshakes and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as S0 flags typically indicate SYN flood behavior.
