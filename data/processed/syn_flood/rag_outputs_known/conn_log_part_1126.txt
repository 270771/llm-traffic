- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.230.178 on port 8545 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
