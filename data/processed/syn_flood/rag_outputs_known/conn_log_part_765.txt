- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14431 to 133.250.116.157:17010 showing S0 state with 1 SYN packet and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 state with a single SYN and no handshake completion is a classic SYN flood indicator. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
