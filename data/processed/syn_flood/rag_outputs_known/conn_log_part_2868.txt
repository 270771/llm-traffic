- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.127.145 on port 43 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
