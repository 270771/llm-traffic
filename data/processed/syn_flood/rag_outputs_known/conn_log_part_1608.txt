- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.200.58 on port 6668 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, consistent with standard threat models.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
