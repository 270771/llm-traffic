- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21513 to 133.118.242.1:21251 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert flags (S0, no established connections, multiple SYNs without ACKs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
