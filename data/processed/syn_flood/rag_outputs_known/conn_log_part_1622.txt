- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.187.195 on port 14006 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact and investigate source for further malicious activity.
