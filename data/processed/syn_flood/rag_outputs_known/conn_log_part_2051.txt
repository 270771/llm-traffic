- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN packets from source 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with flags indicating SYN flood behavior (SH, F, F) and a high count of connection attempts (40).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; however, the alert’s pattern—numerous SYN packets without corresponding ACKs—is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack aimed at exhausting server resources.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent further SYN flood traffic and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
