- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 107.81.9.228 to 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with rapid SYN packets and zero successful handshakes, resulting in RSTR responses.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no established connections and RSTR responses on a sensitive port (23, Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 to prevent potential denial-of-service and investigate source for further malicious activity.
