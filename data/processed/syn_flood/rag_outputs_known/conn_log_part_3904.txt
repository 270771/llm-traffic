- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 on port 23320 sending TCP SYN packets to destination 133.118.213.254 port 9001, with connection state S0 (SYN sent, no response), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.213.254 port 9001, as the connection pattern (S0 state with no handshake completion) is a definitive indicator of SYN flood attack.
