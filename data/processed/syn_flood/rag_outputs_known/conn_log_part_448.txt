- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:23320 to 163.21.170.250:9000 with S0 flag indicating SYN sent but no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record found; no heuristic or taxonomy context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the S0 flag indicates incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
