- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 45.101.6.227 to 203.65.103.15 on port 22 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and immediate REJ (reject) responses, indicating connection initiation without handshake completion.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of repeated SYNs without ACKs and immediate rejects is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack aimed at exhausting server resources on port 22 (SSH).
  â†’ Action: Block IP 45.101.6.227 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
