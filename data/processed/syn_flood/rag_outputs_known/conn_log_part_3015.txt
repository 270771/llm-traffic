- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:30136 to 133.118.147.219:61617 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and zero established connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior; escalate for further investigation due to classic SYN flood indicators (high SYN count, zero completions).
