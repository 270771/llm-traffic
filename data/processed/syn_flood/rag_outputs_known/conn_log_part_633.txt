- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.93.209 on port 9310 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.93.209 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the source IP to protect the target.
