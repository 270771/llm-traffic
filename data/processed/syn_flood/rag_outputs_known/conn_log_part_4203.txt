- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:45330 to 133.118.57.70:49684 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
