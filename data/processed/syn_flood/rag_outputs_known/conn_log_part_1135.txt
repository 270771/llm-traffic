- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44545 to 133.250.100.241:21247 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 state with SYN flags and zero completions) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion on the target.
