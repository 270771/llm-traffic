- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 targeting destination IP 163.21.109.224 on port 36984, with 2880 SYN packets sent and zero established connections (S0 flag).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of high SYN packet count with no connection completions (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, indicating resource exhaustion attempts.
  â†’ Action: Block source IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate the source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
