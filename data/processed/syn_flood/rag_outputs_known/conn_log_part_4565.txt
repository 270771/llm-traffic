- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:13443 to 133.118.36.249:5984 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect server availability.
