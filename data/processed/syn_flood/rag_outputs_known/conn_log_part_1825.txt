- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40525 to 163.21.123.110:12400 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0, count 1).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for unusual SYN packet patterns and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further SYN flood indicators emerge.

**Explanation:**  
Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a SYN packet with no corresponding connection establishment (S0 flag), which is a classic sign of a SYN flood attempt. Without anomaly data or heuristics, confirmation is limited, but the behavior aligns with known SYN flood characteristics. Immediate investigation and proactive rate-limiting are warranted to prevent potential denial-of-service impact.
