- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:63044 to 133.118.172.149:12290 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK (S0 flag), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite the lack of anomaly data or heuristic context, the observed SYN-only connection attempts with no handshake completion are a classic signature of SYN flood attacks and warrant decisive mitigation.
