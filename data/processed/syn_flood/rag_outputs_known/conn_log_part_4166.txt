- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49477 to 163.21.86.68:20018 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0 state, zero established connections, multiple SYNs) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
