- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.245.162 on port 9743 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag, single SYN packets without response) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
