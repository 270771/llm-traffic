- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 with multiple SYN packets and no corresponding ACKs.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately block IP 107.81.9.228 at the firewall and initiate network traffic monitoring for similar patterns, as the observed SYN flood characteristics (multiple SYNs without ACKs) are a classic indicator of a denial-of-service attack.
