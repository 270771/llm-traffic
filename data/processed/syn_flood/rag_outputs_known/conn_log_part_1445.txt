- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.206.150 on port 25007 show SYN packets with no completion of handshake (S0 flag), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 state with no ACKs) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on this source IP for potential malicious activity.
