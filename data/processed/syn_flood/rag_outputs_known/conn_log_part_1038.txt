- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53633 to 133.118.72.218:62237 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the S0 flag and connection pattern alone are strong indicators of a SYN flood attack as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
