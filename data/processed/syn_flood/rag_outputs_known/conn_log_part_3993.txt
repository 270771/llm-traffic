- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33122 to 133.118.143.216:12436 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 SYN sent, 44 packets total, 0 responses).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP connections. Immediate investigation and mitigation are warranted.
