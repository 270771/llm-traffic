- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:21455 to 202.44.253.38:11111 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if traffic persists, as repeated SYN attempts without handshake completion strongly indicate SYN flood behavior.
