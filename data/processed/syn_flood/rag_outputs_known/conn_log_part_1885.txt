- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.54.27 on port 5560 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 temporarily and monitor for continued SYN flood behavior, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack.
