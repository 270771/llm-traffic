- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:56670 to 163.21.63.182:16060 showing S0 state with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high number of SYN packets with zero completions (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target.
