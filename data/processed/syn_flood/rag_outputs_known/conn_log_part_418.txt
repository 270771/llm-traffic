- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.175.42 on port 9530 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshake consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high number of such attempts (44) strongly indicate a SYN flood attack pattern by definition.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
