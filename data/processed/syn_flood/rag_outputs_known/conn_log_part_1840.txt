- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.118.121.10:5900 show SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks, where attackers overwhelm a target by initiating many TCP connections without completing the handshake.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 133.118.121.10 port 5900. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
