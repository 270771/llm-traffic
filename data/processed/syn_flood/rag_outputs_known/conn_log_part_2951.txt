- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.31.198 on port 12385 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known pattern.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 temporarily and monitor for repeated SYN flood behavior due to the classic SYN flood signature (SYNs without ACKs) despite lack of anomaly data.
