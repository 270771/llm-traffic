- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.15.210 on ports 19369 → 17770 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and no established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this as a known pattern.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target system.
