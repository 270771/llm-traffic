- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.191.79 on port 3000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
