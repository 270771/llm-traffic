- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.81.36 on port 7634 show multiple SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks in TCP/IP traffic analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
