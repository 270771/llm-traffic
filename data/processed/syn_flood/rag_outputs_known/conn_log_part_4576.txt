- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:49230 to 203.65.118.77:12215 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a possible SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; escalate to block IP if SYN flood persists.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a TCP connection in S0 state (SYN sent, no response), which is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available, the presence of repeated SYN packets without completion is a known SYN flood signature. Proactive rate-limiting and monitoring are warranted to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact.
