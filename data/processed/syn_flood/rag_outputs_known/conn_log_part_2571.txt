- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.116.155 on port 102 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.116.155 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
