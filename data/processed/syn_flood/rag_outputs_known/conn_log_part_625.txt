- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.187.180 on port 20185 shows a SYN packet with no established connection (S0 flag), only 1 attempt, 44 bytes, and no response.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as the single SYN with no handshake completion is indicative of a potential SYN flood attempt.
