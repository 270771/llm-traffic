- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.33.94 on port 55442 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
