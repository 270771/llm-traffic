- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.250.103.119 on port 15 show a pattern of SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S set, no ACK), consistent with a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential malicious activity and implement rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from this IP to mitigate potential SYN flood impact.
