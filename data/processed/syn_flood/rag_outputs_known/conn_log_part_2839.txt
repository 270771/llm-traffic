- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.37.56 on port 9418 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate further investigation on this IP for persistent malicious activity.
