- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:41347 to 163.21.60.224:12189 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the S0 flag and connection pattern are classic indicators of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall and enable rate-limiting on port 12189 to mitigate further SYN flood attempts.
