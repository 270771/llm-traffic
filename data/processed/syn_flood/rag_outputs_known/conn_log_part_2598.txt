- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.26.192 on port 1521 with SYN flag set and no established connection (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood indicator. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
