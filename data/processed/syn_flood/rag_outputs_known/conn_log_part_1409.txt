- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:59942 to 163.21.141.211:18076 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this detection. However, the alert’s characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion—are consistent with SYN flood attack patterns documented in standard network security practices.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate investigation to confirm malicious intent. If confirmed, block the IP to prevent further disruption.
