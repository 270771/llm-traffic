- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 163.21.144.91:902 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and apply rate-limiting or block if attack persists, as the pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood indicator.
