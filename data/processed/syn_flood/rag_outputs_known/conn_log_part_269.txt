- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.103.82 on port 18182 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate investigation on the source IP for further threat assessment.
