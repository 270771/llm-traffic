- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.117.199 on port 10034 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without handshake completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
