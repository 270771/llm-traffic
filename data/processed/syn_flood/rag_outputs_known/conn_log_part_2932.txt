- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.254.9 on ports 16912 → 12155 with SYN packets sent but no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source for potential malicious intent.
