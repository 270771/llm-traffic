- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.190.254 on port 24510 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on 163.21.190.254 and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
