- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.152.173.55 on port 12148 show rapid SYN packets with zero successful completions and multiple rejections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYNs with no completions and rejections strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
