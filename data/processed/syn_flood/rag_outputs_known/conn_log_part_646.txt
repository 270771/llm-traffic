- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.108.83 on port 9306 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, where the attacker exhausts server resources by initiating connections without completing them.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to protect the target server 203.65.108.83 on port 9306 and investigate the source for malicious activity.
