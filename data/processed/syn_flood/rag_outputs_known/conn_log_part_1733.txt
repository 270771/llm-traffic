- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:4006 to 163.21.220.209:6000 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
