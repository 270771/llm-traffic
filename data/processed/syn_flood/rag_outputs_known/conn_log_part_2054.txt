- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.110.32 on port 264 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and only 1 connection attempt with 44 SYN packets sent and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP anomaly heuristics.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent further SYN flood impact and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
