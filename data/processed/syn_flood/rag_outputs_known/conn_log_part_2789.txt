- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.44.121 on port 16001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
