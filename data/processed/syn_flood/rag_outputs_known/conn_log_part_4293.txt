- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.240.117 on port 61617 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a half-open connection typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) and repeated SYN flags with zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns documented in cybersecurity literature.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
