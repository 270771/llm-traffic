- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.212.116 on port 12444 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 TCP flag state (SYN sent, no response) and high count of SYN packets without completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as per standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If confirmed persistent, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
