- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8122 to 133.118.248.203:12288 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag, 1 attempt, 44 bytes).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the presence of SYN packets with no corresponding connection establishment (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. The absence of anomaly records limits confirmation, but the behavior alone justifies proactive investigation and mitigation.
