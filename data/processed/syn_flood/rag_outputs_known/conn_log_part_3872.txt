- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.185.162 on port 5672 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial of service.
