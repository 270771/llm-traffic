- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 47.41.151.4:29729 to 163.21.148.140:23 show multiple SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in S0 (SYN sent, no reply) state and 2 SYN packets within a short interval.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event; however, the S0 flag and repeated SYNs without completion are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack, consistent with standard TCP anomaly taxonomies identifying half-open connections as a denial-of-service vector.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 47.41.151.4 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 23 and investigate the source IP for malicious activity.
