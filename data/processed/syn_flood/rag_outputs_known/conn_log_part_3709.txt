- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.119.80 on port 9080 shows a SYN flood pattern with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (S0 state, 44 packets, 0 completions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (high SYN count with zero completions) is a classic denial-of-service indicator. Immediately block or rate-limit IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server.
