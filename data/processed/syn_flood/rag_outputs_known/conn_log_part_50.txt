- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:8162 to 133.118.187.82:49682 showing a single SYN packet with no response (flag S0), indicating a half-open connection.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of a SYN packet with no completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Recommend rate-limiting connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
