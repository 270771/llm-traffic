- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from source IP 107.81.9.228 to destination 202.152.173.202 on port 23 show rapid SYN activity with zero successful handshakes and multiple RSTR (reset) flags.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of rapid SYNs with no established connections and resets is characteristic of a SYN flood attack targeting port 23 (Telnet). Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the Telnet service.
