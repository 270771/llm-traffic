- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:24858 to 203.65.87.76:21025 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN-only connection attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if pattern persists, as SYN flood attacks typically manifest as numerous half-open connections (S0 state) overwhelming the target.
