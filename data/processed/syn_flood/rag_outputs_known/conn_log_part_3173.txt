- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36453 to 133.118.24.161:9711 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects resource exhaustion attempts by overwhelming the target with half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from denial-of-service impact.
