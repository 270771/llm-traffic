- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.148.212 on port 2761 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the connection flags and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 established connections).
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
