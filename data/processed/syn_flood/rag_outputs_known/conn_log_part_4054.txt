- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.99.45 on port 10249 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) with a high count of SYN packets (44) and zero established connections is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 203.65.99.45. Initiate investigation on source IP for further malicious activity.
