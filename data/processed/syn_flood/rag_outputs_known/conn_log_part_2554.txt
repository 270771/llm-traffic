- SYN flood alert: Connection from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.36.96:5357 shows TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating many half-open connections consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the TCP flag pattern (S0) and high number of incomplete connections (44) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target 203.65.36.96. Initiate monitoring for similar patterns from other sources.
