- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.182.180 on port 221 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm this pattern. However, the alert’s flags (S0) and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 ACKs) strongly align with classic SYN flood characteristics documented in standard network security practice.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
