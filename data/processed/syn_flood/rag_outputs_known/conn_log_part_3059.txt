- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.115.3 on port 7657 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, and initiate further traffic monitoring to confirm attack persistence.
