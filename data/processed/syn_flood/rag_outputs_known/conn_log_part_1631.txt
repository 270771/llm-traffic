- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.234.18 on port 16003 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by S0 flag and 44 SYN packets sent with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.234.18 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
