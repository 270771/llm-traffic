- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.194.86 on port 23023 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 and zero bytes transferred.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, where the attacker sends SYN requests without completing the handshake to exhaust server resources.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and monitor for additional suspicious activity.
