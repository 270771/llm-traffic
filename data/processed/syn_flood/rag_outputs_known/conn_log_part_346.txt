- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.210.40 on port 11111 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent potential SYN flood attack, as the pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior.
