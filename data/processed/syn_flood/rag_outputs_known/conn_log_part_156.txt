- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.5.176 on port 8123 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACK responses (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in network security taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
