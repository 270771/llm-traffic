- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:44594 to 133.250.100.253:44399 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics as the connection attempts remain half-open without completion.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If sustained, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
