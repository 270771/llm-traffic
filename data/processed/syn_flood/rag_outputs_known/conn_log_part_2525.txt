- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.207.0 on port 110 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it reflects resource exhaustion attempts by overwhelming the target with half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server on port 110.
