- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.45.93:9000 with SYN flag set, no response (S0 state), only 1 packet, 44 bytes, indicating a likely SYN flood pattern.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for repeated SYN attempts and consider rate-limiting or blocking if confirmed as malicious, since SYN flood behavior is indicated by connection attempts with SYN flag and no completion.
