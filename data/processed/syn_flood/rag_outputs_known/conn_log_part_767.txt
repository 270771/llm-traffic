- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:35038 to 163.21.93.65:12193 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm, but the alert flags (S0, SYN packets sent without completion) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack pattern.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
