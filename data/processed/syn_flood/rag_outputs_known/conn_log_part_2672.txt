- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.77.98 on port 12491 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion aligns with standard SYN flood behavior as per common network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
