- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:31802 to 133.118.116.27:993 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags (S0) and connection pattern (single SYN, no ACK) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
