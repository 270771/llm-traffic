- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.106.161 on port 18044 with SYN packets sent but no completion (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets without connection completion (S0) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect resources.
