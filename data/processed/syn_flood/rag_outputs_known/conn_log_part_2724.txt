- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 107.81.9.228:50118 to 202.152.173.202:23 showing rapid SYN behavior with no established connections and multiple resets (RSTR).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this as a SYN flood.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN attempts with resets on port 23 (commonly Telnet) is consistent with SYN flood behavior. Immediately rate-limit connections from 107.81.9.228 and monitor for escalation. If traffic persists, block the IP to protect the Telnet service from denial-of-service impact.
