- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:34012 to 133.118.81.215:12001 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the observed pattern of SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
