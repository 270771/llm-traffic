- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:20012 to 133.118.215.181:443 shows S0 state with 1 SYN packet sent, 44 retransmissions, and no response (no established connection).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the high number of SYN retransmissions without response (S0 state) is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Immediately rate-limit or block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Initiate further monitoring for similar patterns.
