- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:47512 to 133.118.183.211:16404 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the S0 flag with zero successful connections and multiple SYN packets strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
