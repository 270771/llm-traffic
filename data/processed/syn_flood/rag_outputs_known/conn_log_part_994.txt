- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:9696 to 203.65.85.142:16010 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature (S0 flag with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; if attack persists, block the source IP to protect target resources.
