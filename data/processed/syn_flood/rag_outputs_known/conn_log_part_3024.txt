- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:37057 to 203.65.118.77:10033 with SYN flag set, no response, and connection state S0 (SYN sent, no reply).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed pattern—numerous SYN packets without completion—is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
