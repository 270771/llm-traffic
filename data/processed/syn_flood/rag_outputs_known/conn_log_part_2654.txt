- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.1.110 on port 10034 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of a SYN flood attack.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood signature is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet counts (44 SYNs, 0 ACKs). This pattern aligns with known SYN flood behavior where the attacker sends many SYN requests without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 167.249.133.167 immediately to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect the target server. Initiate monitoring for additional suspicious activity from related IPs.
