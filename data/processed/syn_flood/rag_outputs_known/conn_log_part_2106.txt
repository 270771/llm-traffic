- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.118.141 on port 5222 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and 0 completions, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for potential malicious activity. Implement rate-limiting on port 5222 to mitigate further SYN flood attempts.
