- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 163.21.205.169:9000 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further resource exhaustion on destination 163.21.205.169:9000 and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
