- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:14061 to 163.21.166.59:36982 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion, as the observed SYN-only connection attempts (S0) are a classic signature of SYN flood attacks. Initiate further network monitoring for similar patterns.
