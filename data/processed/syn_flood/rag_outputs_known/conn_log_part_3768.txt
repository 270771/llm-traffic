- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:46884 to 163.21.92.18:30122 showing SYN packets without completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and multiple SYN packets without ACKs are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior as per standard TCP/IP attack patterns.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
