- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:24602 to 203.65.104.233:21246 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server 203.65.104.233.
