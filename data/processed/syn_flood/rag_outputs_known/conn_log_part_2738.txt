- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48558 to 163.21.236.218:16024 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further validate. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly correspond to classic SYN flood behavior, where SYN packets are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.  
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
