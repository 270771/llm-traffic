- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43377 to 203.65.72.29:50104 with SYN packets resulting in S0 state (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the presence of multiple SYN packets with no handshake completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
