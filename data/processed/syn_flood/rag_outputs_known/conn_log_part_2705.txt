- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:35205 to 133.118.53.143:2379 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (S0 state with SYN sent but no ACK received) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
