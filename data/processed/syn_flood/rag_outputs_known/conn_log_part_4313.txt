- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:61565 to 202.44.205.136:12478 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, resulting in multiple half-open connections (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the observed pattern of repeated SYN packets without completion is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for escalation. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
