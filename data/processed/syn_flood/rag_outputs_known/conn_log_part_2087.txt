- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 167.249.133.167:21756 to 163.21.86.78:31001 shows SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
