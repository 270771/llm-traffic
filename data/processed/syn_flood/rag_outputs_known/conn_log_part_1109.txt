- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:21491 to 133.118.9.77:8087 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack emerges.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the S0 flag indicates a SYN packet sent without a corresponding SYN-ACK or ACK, consistent with SYN flood behavior. Given the lack of additional data, proactive investigation and cautious mitigation are warranted.
