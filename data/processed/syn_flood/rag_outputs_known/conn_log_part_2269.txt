- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 202.44.216.225 on port 18111 show a high number of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs, indicated by the S0 flag and 44 SYN packets with zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system.
