- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:56416 to 163.21.52.52:14403 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the observed SYN-only packets with no handshake completion strongly indicate SYN flood behavior requiring proactive mitigation.
