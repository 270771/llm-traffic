- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.101.155 on port 8620 shows a SYN packet with no corresponding ACK or completion (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshake.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Note:** Due to absence of anomaly data and heuristic context, confirmation is limited; however, the observed SYN-only connection attempts with no handshake completion are consistent with SYN flood behavior and warrant proactive mitigation.
