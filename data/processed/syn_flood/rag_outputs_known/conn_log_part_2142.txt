- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.112.248 on port 1311 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and high SYN count with zero completions are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 immediately to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
