- SYN flood alert: TCP SYN flood detected from source IP 167.249.133.167 to destination IP 133.250.147.192 on port 48889, characterized by numerous SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the alert flags (S0) and connection behavior (many SYNs, no completions).
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect the target system from denial-of-service impact.
