- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48369 to 133.118.8.190:16000 showing S0 flag with 44 SYN packets sent and zero successful connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

Explanation: Although no anomaly data or heuristics are provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—many SYN packets sent without completing connections (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by half-opening TCP connections. Without explicit anomaly confirmation, proactive investigation and mitigation are warranted.
