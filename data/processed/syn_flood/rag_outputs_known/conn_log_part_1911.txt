- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.34.209 on port 55442 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
