- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2609 to 133.118.226.85:12239 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and protect target 133.118.226.85. Initiate further investigation to identify potential attack patterns due to absence of anomaly records.
