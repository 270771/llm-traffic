- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:58430 to 133.118.222.78:12902 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0 state, SYN packets sent without response) are classic indicators of SYN flood behavior, consistent with known TCP SYN flood patterns where attackers send numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
