- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.117.39 on port 7779 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with a SYN flood attack.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-established indicator of SYN flood behavior in network security taxonomy.
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target system from resource exhaustion.
