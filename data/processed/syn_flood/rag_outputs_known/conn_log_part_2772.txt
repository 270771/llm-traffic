- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 203.65.92.68:5985 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s pattern (multiple SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN requests without ACKs, causing resource exhaustion on the target.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target 203.65.92.68 from potential denial-of-service impact. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for malicious activity.
