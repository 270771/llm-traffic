- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:50541 to 203.65.45.197:14401 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the SYN flood signature is evident from the connection state (S0) and packet flags (SYN only, no ACKs).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 203.65.45.197. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
