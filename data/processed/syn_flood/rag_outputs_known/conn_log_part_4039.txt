- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167:47878 to 163.21.218.198:18888 show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential compromise or malicious intent.
