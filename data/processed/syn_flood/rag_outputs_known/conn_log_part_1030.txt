- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.250.130.195 on port 12132 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm, but the SYN flood signature (S0 state with zero established connections) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate potential SYN flood impact. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
