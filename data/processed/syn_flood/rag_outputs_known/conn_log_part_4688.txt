- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:20603 to 163.21.10.247:18028 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 0 completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Investigate source IP 167.249.133.167 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:** Although no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the alert shows a classic SYN flood pattern—numerous SYN packets without completing connections (S0 state). This behavior is consistent with SYN flood attacks that exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP handshakes. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
