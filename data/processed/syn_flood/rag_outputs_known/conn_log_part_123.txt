- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.244.144 on port 135 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no ACK received).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to protect the target host from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
