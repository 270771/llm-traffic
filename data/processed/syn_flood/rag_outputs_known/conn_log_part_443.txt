- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.111.60 on port 12457 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 to prevent potential SYN flood impact, and initiate investigation on this source IP for further malicious activity.

Despite lack of explicit anomaly records or heuristics, the presence of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 flag) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks and warrants proactive mitigation.
