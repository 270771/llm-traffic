- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.9.148 on port 55442 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response), with 44 attempts and zero completions.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion (S0) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack, overwhelming the target with half-open connections.
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target host from resource exhaustion.
