- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:22602 to 133.250.148.127:12267 showing S0 flag with zero successful connections and one attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the S0 flag with zero established connections and multiple SYN attempts is a well-known indicator of SYN flood attacks in standard TCP anomaly detection taxonomy.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 at the firewall to prevent further SYN flood traffic and protect target 133.250.148.127 from resource exhaustion. Initiate investigation on source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
