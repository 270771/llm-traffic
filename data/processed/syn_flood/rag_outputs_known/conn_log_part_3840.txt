- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.155.18 on port 8649 shows SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match this event. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, as it exhausts server resources by leaving half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
