- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.80.43 on port 12285 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this behavior. However, the S0 flag and single SYN packet without response is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks, consistent with standard network security knowledge.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and investigate source for potential malicious activity.
