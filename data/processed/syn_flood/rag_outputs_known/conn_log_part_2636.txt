- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.103.87 on port 135 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Investigate source IP 93.81.158.106 for potential SYN flood activity and consider rate-limiting or blocking if further evidence of attack is found.

**Explanation:**  
The alert shows a SYN packet sent without completing the handshake (S0 state), which is a classic indicator of a SYN flood attempt. Although no anomaly record or heuristic context is available to directly confirm this, the behavior aligns with known SYN flood patterns where attackers send numerous SYN packets without completing handshakes to exhaust server resources. Immediate investigation and proactive mitigation are warranted.
