- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.29.27 on port 20082 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the presence of multiple SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion on target 133.118.29.27. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
