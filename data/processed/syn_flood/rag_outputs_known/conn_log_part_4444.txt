- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:52248 to 133.250.132.173:18443 showing SYN packets with no established connections (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero completed connections strongly indicate a SYN flood pattern by definition—numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If sustained, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
