- SYN flood alert: TCP session from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 133.250.182.127:7657 shows SYN flood characteristics with multiple SYN packets and no established connections (flag S0).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the observed SYN flood pattern (numerous SYNs without completion) is a classic DoS indicator; immediately block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate source for further malicious activity.
