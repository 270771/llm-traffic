- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 202.44.232.239 on port 8880 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior characterized by numerous half-open connections (S0 state).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion and mitigate the SYN flood attack. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
