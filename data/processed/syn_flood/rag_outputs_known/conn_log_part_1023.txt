- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55972 to 203.65.83.169:12364 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and zero established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of explicit anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block the IP to protect the target server.
