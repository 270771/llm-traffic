- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.175.93 on port 2480 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN sent, no ACK received) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the pattern persists, block the IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
