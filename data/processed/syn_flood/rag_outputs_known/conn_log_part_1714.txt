- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.68.188 on port 12404 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the SYN flood pattern is evident from the TCP flags and connection behavior (SYN sent, no response).  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming SYN packets from IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target server. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
