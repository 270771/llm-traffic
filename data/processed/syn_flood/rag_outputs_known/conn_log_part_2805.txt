- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106:24880 to 203.65.107.130:1723 show repeated SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly align with classic SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYNs without corresponding ACKs or connection establishment.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
