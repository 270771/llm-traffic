- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:54275 to 203.65.98.247:55555 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert flags an S0 state with SYN packets sent but no response, a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks aiming to exhaust server resources by half-open connections.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial of service.
