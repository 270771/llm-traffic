- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:29011 to 202.152.172.104:6664 showing SYN flood characteristics (S0 state, 44 SYN packets, 0 ACKs).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the high volume of SYN packets without corresponding ACKs (S0 state) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the IP to protect target resources.
