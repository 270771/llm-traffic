- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.58.74 on port 5006 show SYN packets without completing the handshake (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets sent, no ACK received) aligns with classic SYN flood behavior, where attackers exhaust server resources by initiating but not completing TCP handshakes.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to protect the target server from resource exhaustion. Initiate further investigation on this IP for potential malicious activity.
