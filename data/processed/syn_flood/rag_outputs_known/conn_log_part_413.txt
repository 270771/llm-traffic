- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.183.27 on port 1433 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding completions (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of a SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s characteristics (numerous SYNs without handshake completion) align with standard SYN flood behavior.
  → Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on port 1433 and investigate the source for further malicious activity.
