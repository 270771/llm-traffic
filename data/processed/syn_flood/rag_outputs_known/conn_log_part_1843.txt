- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 203.65.87.48 on port 631 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found to directly match this event. However, the presence of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 flag) is a well-known indicator of SYN flood behavior, consistent with standard SYN flood detection heuristics.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
