- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:18764 to 133.250.77.106:12375 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0 state with SYN sent but no ACK received) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior, where numerous half-open connections exhaust server resources.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
