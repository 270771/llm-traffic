- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:53000 to 133.118.175.115:20184 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flag pattern (S0) and connection attempt characteristics align with standard SYN flood signatures documented in cybersecurity practice.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to prevent denial-of-service impact.
