- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 163.21.32.206 on port 12282 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state) is a well-known signature of SYN flood attacks.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately block or rate-limit incoming TCP SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood and protect the target system. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
