- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48477 to 133.250.170.141:9206 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity to prevent resource exhaustion. Investigate source IP for potential blocking if attack persists.
