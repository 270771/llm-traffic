- SYN flood alert: Source IP 157.161.40.85 on high port 63916 targeting 192.222.97.152 port 443 with 7485 SYN packets over 2.6 seconds, no anomalies recorded.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly ID or heuristic available due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context.
  â†’ Action: Despite absence of anomaly records, the high volume of SYN packets in a short time frame to a single destination port strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately rate-limit connections from 157.161.40.85 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target server.
