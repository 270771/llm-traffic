- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:39933 to 202.44.194.12:10390 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to further confirm. However, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion of the handshake.  
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming connections from source IP 167.249.133.167 to mitigate the SYN flood attack and prevent resource exhaustion on the target server. Investigate source for potential malicious activity.
