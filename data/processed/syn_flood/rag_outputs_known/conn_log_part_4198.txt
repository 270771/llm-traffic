- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:43537 to 133.118.230.178:44444 showing SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (S0 state, 1 SYN sent, 44 retransmissions).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to explicitly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of repeated SYN packets without handshake completion (S0 state with multiple retransmissions) is a classic SYN flood signature. Immediately rate-limit connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block the source IP to protect the target system.
