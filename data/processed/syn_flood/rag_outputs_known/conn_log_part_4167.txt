- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:9696 to 203.65.99.224:16010 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data or heuristic context available to directly match or explain this event. However, the S0 flag (SYN sent, no response) and single SYN packet count with zero completions strongly align with SYN flood characteristics as per standard TCP/IP behavior analysis.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent resource exhaustion on destination 203.65.99.224. Initiate further investigation on source IP for malicious activity.
