- SYN flood alert: Source IP 93.81.158.106 initiated a TCP connection flood targeting destination 133.250.168.10 on port 53, with multiple SYN packets sent without completing handshakes (flag S0, count 44).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data and heuristic context, the observed pattern of numerous incomplete TCP handshakes (SYN packets without ACKs) on port 53 strongly indicates a SYN flood attack. Immediately block or rate-limit traffic from 93.81.158.106 to protect the DNS service at 133.250.168.10. Initiate further investigation on the source IP for potential malicious activity.
