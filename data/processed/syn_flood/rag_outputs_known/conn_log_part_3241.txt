- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167 to 203.65.93.78 on port 14873 shows SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0) and connection pattern (many SYNs with zero completions) are classic indicators of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for further suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect network resources.
