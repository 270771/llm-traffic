- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:40234 to 133.118.92.208:20107 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 flag), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to directly confirm this event. However, the alert flags (S0, F, F) and zero established connections strongly align with classic SYN flood patterns characterized by numerous SYN requests without completing handshakes, overwhelming the target.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 and initiate blocking if the behavior persists to mitigate potential denial-of-service impact. Investigate source for further malicious activity.
