- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 167.249.133.167 to 133.118.140.71 on port 16010 show a high number of SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to cross-validate. However, the observed pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity. If the behavior persists, block the source IP to protect the target server from resource exhaustion.
