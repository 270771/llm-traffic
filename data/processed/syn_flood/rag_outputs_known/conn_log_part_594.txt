- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:55716 to 163.21.199.63:12146 showing S0 flag with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; however, the S0 flag indicates SYN packets sent without completing the handshake, a classic signature of SYN flood attacks.
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued abnormal connection attempts; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
