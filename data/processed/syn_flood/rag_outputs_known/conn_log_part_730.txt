- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:33954 to 202.44.234.30:12457 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 SYN packets and 0 established connections.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly data, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 167.249.133.167 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If volume persists, block IP to protect target server.
