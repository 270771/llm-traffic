- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:2780 to 163.21.148.218:17070 showing SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), indicating incomplete TCP handshakes consistent with SYN flood behavior.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the alert’s TCP flags and connection state (S0) directly indicate SYN flood characteristics—numerous SYN packets without completion.
  → Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming connections from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued SYN flood activity; if persistent, block the IP to protect network resources.
