- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 93.81.158.106:26494 to 133.118.244.60:50000 showing S0 flag (SYN sent, no response), with 44 packets and 1 connection attempt.
  Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found; no heuristic context available to directly confirm.
  â†’ Action: Despite lack of anomaly records, the pattern of numerous SYN packets without completion (S0 state) strongly indicates a SYN flood attempt. Recommend immediate rate-limiting on source IP 93.81.158.106 and monitoring for further suspicious activity. If attack persists, block IP to protect target server.
