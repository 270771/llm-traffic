- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 133.118.60.1 on port 2082 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs, indicated by TCP flag S0 (SYN sent, no response).
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 flag pattern is a classic indicator of SYN flood behavior, where numerous SYN requests are sent without completing the handshake, overwhelming the target.
  â†’ Action: Block IP 93.81.158.106 to prevent further SYN flood attempts and protect the target server.
