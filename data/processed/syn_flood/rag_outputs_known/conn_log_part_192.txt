- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:48823 to 163.21.51.249:54321 showing SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood behavior.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm, but the observed pattern (S0 state with SYN packets sent and no response) is a classic signature of a SYN flood attack.  
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit or block incoming SYN packets from source IP 167.249.133.167 to prevent resource exhaustion and investigate the source for potential malicious activity.
