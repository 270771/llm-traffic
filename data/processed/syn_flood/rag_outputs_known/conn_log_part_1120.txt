- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempt from 167.249.133.167:36963 to 133.118.247.207:12229 with SYN flag set and no response (S0 state), indicating a likely SYN flood.
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available; however, the S0 TCP state (SYN sent, no response) is a classic indicator of SYN flood attacks as it shows incomplete TCP handshakes.
  â†’ Action: Immediately rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 167.249.133.167 and monitor for continued suspicious activity; if persistent, block the IP to prevent resource exhaustion.
