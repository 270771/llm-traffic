- SYN flood alert: TCP connection attempts from 93.81.158.106 to 163.21.222.37 on port 4899 show SYN packets with no corresponding ACKs (flag S0), indicating half-open connections typical of SYN flood attacks.  
  Justified by anomaly: No matching anomaly record or heuristic context available to confirm. However, the observed pattern (SYN packets without completion) is a classic signature of SYN flood behavior.  
  â†’ Action: Rate-limit incoming SYN packets from 93.81.158.106 and monitor for further suspicious activity; consider blocking if attack volume persists.
