Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.72.129.52) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013236.12). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.195.97, 133.243.66.122, 133.243.117.241, 133.243.66.124, 133.243.66.125, and others as listed.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
4. Monitor network performance and logs for continued or escalating ICMP traffic.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source if attack volume is high.
6. Ensure critical services on 35.72.129.52 have redundancy or failover to maintain availability during mitigation.
