Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here the source port is 3 and destination port is 1, which corresponds to ICMP type 1 - "Destination Unreachable"), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. 

Next steps: Investigate the cause of ICMP type 1 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics, but no flooding or DoS attack is evident from this data.
