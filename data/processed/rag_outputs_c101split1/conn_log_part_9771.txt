Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8, 11, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 121.87.70.138 to destination 203.78.219.142, but it shows a single packet (count=1) with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other volumetric ICMP attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 messages if they persist, as they may indicate routing or network issues.
