Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis for ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) indicate other ICMP message types unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, this is not a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or anomaly data to identify if these ICMP messages are part of a larger pattern of network anomalies.
