Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.
- Specifically, no entries indicate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP) and other TCP connections do not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy can be made.
- The traffic appears to be connection attempts or scans (S0 state), which may indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The S0 connection state typically indicates connection attempts without completion, often linked to scanning or reconnaissance.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs, as this could indicate SIP scanning or a different type of UDP flood.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Enable deeper packet inspection or IDS/IPS rules to detect and alert on ICMP Echo Request floods or other volumetric attacks.
