Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, no ping flood is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood or other attacks can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ICMP flood.
- Monitor for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
- If scanning activity is suspected from the TCP SYN failures, consider applying heuristics related to port scanning (e.g., heuristic for SYN scan) and investigate those IPs further.
