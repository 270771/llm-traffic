Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present (e.g., from 172.23.68.231 to 163.45.161.56 and from 203.78.143.78 to 88.200.117.2), but the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding. The timestamps and counts show isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a high-rate flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are also present, which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related anomalies if they appear in future logs.
