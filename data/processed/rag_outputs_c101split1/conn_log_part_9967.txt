Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, each connection has a count of only 1 packet (`-1` in the last field), indicating no high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood attack. Additionally, the connections are to different destination IPs, not a sustained flood targeting a single host.

The last entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination.  
- Investigate if any host is experiencing network degradation or packet loss.  
- Enable rate-limiting or ICMP flood detection on perimeter devices if suspicious patterns emerge.
