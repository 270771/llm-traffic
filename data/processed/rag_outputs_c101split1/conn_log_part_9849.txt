Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The entries have ICMP protocol with no further detail indicating repeated Echo Requests or high volume typical of a ping flood. Additionally, no anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connection states are OTH (other), and no payload or flags suggest a different attack vector.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic. Monitor for high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from the source IPs to the destination IPs to detect potential ping floods. Enable anomaly detection heuristics that flag excessive ICMP Echo Requests if available.
