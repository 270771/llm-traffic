Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not indicated here.
- The absence of ICMP traffic and no anomaly records related to ICMP or ping floods confirm no such attack is detected.
- The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, but typically, ping flood detection relies on identifying high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic, which is missing.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to ensure no stealthy ping floods are occurring.
