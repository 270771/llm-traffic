Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in both entries is `8`, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP echo requests to different destination IPs, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a ping flood attack. There is no evidence of repeated or sustained ICMP traffic from the source IP 151.105.96.5 to overwhelm the targets.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific classification.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this or other sources. If a surge in echo requests is detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
