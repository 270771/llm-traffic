Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 13. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.143, but it shows only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior. Without heuristic context or anomaly taxonomy, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- If other ICMP types or unusual flags appear, consider other ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes are assigned due to lack of anomaly data and context.
