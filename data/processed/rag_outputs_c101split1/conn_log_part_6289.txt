Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries with type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) are present, but none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 3 indicates network diagnostic or error messages, not flooding with echo requests.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic typically relates to network troubleshooting or error reporting rather than attack behavior.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or routing issues causing excessive ICMP error messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
