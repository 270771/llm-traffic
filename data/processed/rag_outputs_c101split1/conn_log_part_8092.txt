Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6).
- There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate ping activity.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, a ping flood cannot be occurring.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- No heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:
- Investigate other potential TCP-based attacks such as SYN floods or port scans, as many connections show SYN sent (S0) but no established sessions.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic specifically to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Enable logging or anomaly detection for ICMP type and rate to catch ping floods early.
