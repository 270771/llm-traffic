Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.198.197.73, from many different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / DoS Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.227.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.227.167.254, 133.227.178.246, 133.227.205.11, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.198.197.73 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.198.197.73.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.
  4. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary use cases only.
