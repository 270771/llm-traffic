Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 1, and 13. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the single entry with type 8 (first line) does not show a high volume or rapid repetition indicative of a flood. The other entries are ICMP types 1 (Echo Reply) and 13 (Timestamp), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.148.16 sending ICMP type 8 packets if volume increases.  
- Check for other ICMP-based anomalies or different attack types, such as ICMP scanning or reconnaissance, given the presence of types 1 and 13.
