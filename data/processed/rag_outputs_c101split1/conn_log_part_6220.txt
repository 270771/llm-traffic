Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an initiating ping flood. There is no evidence of repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source targeting a victim at high volume, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP traffic appears normal or related to other ICMP functions (e.g., traceroute or ping replies).

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.120 sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual in your environment, as this may indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Continue logging and correlate with other network data for potential anomalies.
