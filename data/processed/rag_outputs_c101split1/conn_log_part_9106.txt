Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8, except one entry with type 13 (timestamp request). The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, by standard ICMP protocol definitions:  
- ICMP type 8 = Echo Request (ping)  
- ICMP type 13 = Timestamp Request (not related to ping flood)  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 13 packets (e.g., 157.206.101.113) for unusual timestamp request activity, which could indicate reconnaissance or other probing behavior.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable logging and alerting on ICMP Echo Requests exceeding normal thresholds.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and no ping flood indicators.
