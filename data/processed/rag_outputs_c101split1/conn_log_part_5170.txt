Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be a series of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
