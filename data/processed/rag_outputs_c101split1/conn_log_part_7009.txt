Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after IPs and ports), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.154.254 and destination IP 104.140.140.15 for potential network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies, such as scanning or misconfigurations, since ICMP type 1 messages often indicate network errors or unreachable hosts. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 1 messages could be warranted.
