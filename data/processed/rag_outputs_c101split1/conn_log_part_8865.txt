Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.206.29 to destination 104.81.47.3, but there is only a single such connection record. The other ICMP entries have type 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The observed ICMP traffic with types 0 and 11 could be normal Echo Replies or Time Exceeded messages, respectively.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency from any single source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or reconnaissance activity.
