Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- These requests are originating from numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.14.57, 157.206.14.153, 157.206.2.254, etc.) targeting a single destination IP 107.102.62.64.
- The high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from many sources in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds) matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with excessive ping requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 107.102.62.64 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.14.57, 157.206.14.153, 157.206.2.254, 157.206.249.203, 157.206.20.244, 157.206.172.208, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 107.102.62.64.
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other related anomalies.
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
6. Review and harden host and network configurations to limit ICMP traffic exposure.
