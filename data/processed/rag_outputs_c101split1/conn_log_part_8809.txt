Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log entry is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal a developing ping flood attack.
