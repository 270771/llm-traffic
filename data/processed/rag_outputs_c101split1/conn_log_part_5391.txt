Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect ping floods. Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets. Also, review TCP SYN flood heuristics if SYN scan or flood is suspected.
