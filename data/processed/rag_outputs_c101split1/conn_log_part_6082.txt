Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0 respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and echo reply (type 0), which may indicate normal network behavior or other ICMP-related diagnostics rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual traffic patterns or other types of ICMP misuse, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted. If further anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or network metrics.
