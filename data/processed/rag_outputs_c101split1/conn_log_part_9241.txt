Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which is "3" for both source and destination ports. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state "OTH" (other) and flags do not indicate a flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
