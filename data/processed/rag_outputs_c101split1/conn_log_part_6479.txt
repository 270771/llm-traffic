Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood. Monitoring for actual ICMP type 8 floods should continue.
