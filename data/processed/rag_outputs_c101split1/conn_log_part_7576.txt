Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 47.38.251.237 to 203.78.135.92, with a single packet of 32 bytes and a duration of 0.003 seconds. This does not indicate a flood, as there is no evidence of high packet volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of type 8 ICMP floods means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types that could indicate other network issues or attacks.
