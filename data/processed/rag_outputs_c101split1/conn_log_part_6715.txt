Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.203.14.148 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps around 1641013210.5). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target IP is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target**.  
- The taxonomy class is **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 54.203.14.148 (destination)  
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources including 157.206.121.230, 157.206.195.156, 157.206.195.231, 157.206.195.131, 157.206.8.166, 157.206.161.55, 157.206.229.128, 157.206.203.159, 157.206.205.109, 157.206.206.233  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 54.203.14.148.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from identified attacker IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust defenses accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible to mitigate impact.
