Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic in the log has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping) packets. However, the volume and pattern shown are minimalâ€”only three isolated ICMP echo requests with no indication of rapid, repeated, or volumetric traffic typical of a ping flood. There is no evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If this traffic were to be suspicious, heuristic #1 would typically relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ DDoS - ICMP Flood," but this does not apply here due to lack of volume or pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if other ICMP types or protocols show suspicious patterns.
