Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only; there are no ICMP records present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (SYN sent, no response) for possible port scanning or network reconnaissance. This aligns with heuristic class "Network Scanning" (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies). Confirm by correlating with IDS alerts or additional logs capturing scanning behavior.
