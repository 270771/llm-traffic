Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is an ICMP Echo Reply, it may be part of normal network communication or a response to a previous ping request.

No attack is present here. If further investigation is desired, review preceding logs for ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the source IP 133.243.16.37 to 220.254.134.232 to detect potential ping floods.
