Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 58, 1, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP types 1 and 58 correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Router Advertisement" or other control messages, not echo requests.  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. Given the absence of echo requests, no ping flood or related ICMP flooding attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 1 and 58 messages to ensure they are legitimate network control traffic and not part of a reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts promptly.
