Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 133.243.6.38 to 212.186.50.4 with ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets being sent in high volume, this does not match a ping flood pattern. The second entry shows ICMP type 0 from 203.78.143.78 to 211.155.10.113, also Echo Reply, not Echo Request.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source of the ICMP Echo Replies to ensure they are legitimate responses to prior requests. Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
