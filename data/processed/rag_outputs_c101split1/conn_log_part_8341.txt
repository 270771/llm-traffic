Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but there are only two isolated ICMP echo requests with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood. The logs show single packets from two different source IPs to two different destination IPs, with no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without additional data indicating high packet rates or repeated ICMP echo requests, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a surge in ICMP echo requests is observed, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
