Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the packet count is only 48 over approximately 10.5 seconds, which does not indicate a flood-level volume. The second entry has ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since ICMP type 8 is present but at low volume, this traffic appears normal or benign.

Next steps: Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs, especially if packet counts increase dramatically in a short time frame. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
