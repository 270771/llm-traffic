Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.146, 83.228.82.106) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to scanning and reconnaissance if available, typically classified under "Network Scanning" or "Reconnaissance" taxonomy.

Next steps:  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze ICMP traffic explicitly.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.  
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect future ping flood attempts.
