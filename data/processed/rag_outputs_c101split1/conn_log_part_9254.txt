Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the ICMP type, this could be legitimate timestamp request traffic or a reconnaissance attempt, but it is not a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (133.243.18.108) to detect potential ping floods. Also, investigate if ICMP type 13 traffic is unusually frequent or correlated with other suspicious activity.
