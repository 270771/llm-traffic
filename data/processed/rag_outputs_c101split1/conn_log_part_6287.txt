Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 1, 3, or 5 (as indicated by the 4th field after the source IP, e.g., 11, 3), but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic appears to be other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, echo reply, or other control messages), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP messages further to ensure they are legitimate control traffic and not part of another ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Specifically, verify if the volume or frequency of these ICMP types is abnormal, and monitor for any changes to ICMP type 8 traffic.
