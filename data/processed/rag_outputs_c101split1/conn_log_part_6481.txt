Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP traffic may be related to network diagnostics or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.18.108 and destination IP 185.167.249.223 for any unusual patterns or repeated ICMP type 11 messages that could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
