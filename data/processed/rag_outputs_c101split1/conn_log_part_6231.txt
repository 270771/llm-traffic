Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The ICMP type values are 11 and 8. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The entry with ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641013206.084210) shows a single ICMP Echo Request from 175.8.30.112 to 133.105.14.85, but there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid repetition of such packets indicative of a flood. The other entry with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP in a short time window to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets are part of a traceroute or other diagnostic activity, as they are not malicious by themselves.  
- If unusual ICMP traffic volume is observed later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (e.g., heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests; taxonomy class: DoS/ICMP Flood).
