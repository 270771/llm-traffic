Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. The high volume of distinct source IPs (e.g., multiple 157.206.x.x addresses) sending ICMP type 8 packets to a few destination IPs (notably 3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114) within a very short timestamp window strongly indicates a distributed ping flood pattern.
- This matches known ping flood attack characteristics: a large number of ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High-volume ICMP Echo Request flood**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources in the 157.206.0.0/16 range and 203.78.140.213, targeting destination IPs 3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
  2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
  3. Deploy or tune DoS mitigation appliances or cloud-based scrubbing services to absorb and filter ICMP flood traffic.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
  5. Review and update ICMP handling policies to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic where possible.
