Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.153.34 and destination IP 112.54.36.207 for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages that could indicate network problems or scanning activity.
