Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types. Only entries with ICMP type 8 represent echo requests (ping). Here, there are a few entries with ICMP type 8 (e.g., from 85.101.16.58 to 203.78.135.92, 172.23.68.231 to 133.251.175.207, and 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.230). However, the volume and frequency of these echo requests do not indicate a flood pattern. The timestamps are very close but the number of packets and duration do not show a sustained high-rate flood typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of excessive ICMP echo requests or other suspicious behavior, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request rate from these IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs have a history of suspicious activity.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using heuristics such as high packet rate and sustained echo requests.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
