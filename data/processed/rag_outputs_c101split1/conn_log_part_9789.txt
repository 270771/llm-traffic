Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the ICMP type 3 traffic likely represents normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of misconfigurations or network issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
