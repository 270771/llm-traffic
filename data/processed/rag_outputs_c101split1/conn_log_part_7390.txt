Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the conn.log snippet shows ICMP type values of 11 and 3, not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping requests, these entries do not represent ping floods.  
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded," and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," which are control messages, not ping requests.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. However, the presence of ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) could warrant further investigation into network issues or misconfigurations causing these errors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP error messages to ensure network stability and rule out potential reconnaissance or misrouting issues.
