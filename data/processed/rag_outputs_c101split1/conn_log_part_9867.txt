Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry from 133.243.18.106 to 211.45.94.127 has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). The second entry from 69.232.165.137 to 163.45.254.197 has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single instance logged, not a flood or high volume of echo requests indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, since a ping flood requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, the current data does not meet this criterion.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic for potential traceroute or network scanning activity, which may be benign but worth confirming.
