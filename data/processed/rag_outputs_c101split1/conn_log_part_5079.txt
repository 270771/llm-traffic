Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this requires further investigation.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning activity. Collect ICMP logs to monitor for any future ping flood attempts.
