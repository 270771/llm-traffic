Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (commonly related to ICMP Echo Request floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log primarily logs connection-oriented protocols (TCP/UDP).  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity indicated by the many TCP connection attempts with SYN flags and no completions (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or SYN flood attempts. These could be investigated under heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning or SYN flood attacks.
