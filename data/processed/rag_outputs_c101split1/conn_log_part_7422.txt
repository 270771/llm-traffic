Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a connection state of OTH (other), but the ICMP type is not explicitly indicated as type 8 (Echo Request) in the log snippet. Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another type of attack. The OTH state may indicate incomplete or unusual connection termination but is insufficient to classify this as a ping flood or other attack.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type field in more detail if available, and monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 157.206.59.155 to the destination 167.46.181.108. Also, review additional logs for volume and frequency patterns consistent with flooding.
