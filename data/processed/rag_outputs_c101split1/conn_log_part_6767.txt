Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.241.89) from numerous distinct source IPs within the same timestamp. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- In absence of explicit anomaly records or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.  
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High volume ICMP flood)  
- Taxonomy class: Network DoS Attack / ICMP Flood

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Target IP: 44.202.241.89 (no port for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.117.254, 133.227.206.249, 133.227.72.130, 133.227.144.251, 133.227.144.248, 133.227.144.254, 133.227.183.254, 133.227.210.244, 133.227.209.5, 133.227.204.7, 133.227.72.136, 133.227.195.255, 133.227.196.1, 133.227.130.189, 133.227.151.1, 133.227.112.2, 133.227.177.7, 133.227.29.42, 133.227.29.39, 133.227.213.1, 133.227.157.54, 133.227.148.255, 133.227.6.121

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to mitigate the flood.  
2. Block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP addresses at the firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
3. Monitor the target host (44.202.241.89) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.  
4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or participation in a botnet.  
5. Consider deploying upstream DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume escalates.  
6. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
