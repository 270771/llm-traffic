Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 8. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it cannot be a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. There is no evidence of repeated or sustained ICMP Echo Requests from one source to one destination that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic may warrant investigation for network issues or traceroute activity, but it is not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any unusual patterns or spikes in ICMP traffic volume.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems if available.
