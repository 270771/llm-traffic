Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) targeting a single destination IP, 18.55.153.245, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013211.23xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 130.187.x.x range and others (e.g., 133.227.58.120) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.55.153.245. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 18.55.153.245.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting flood behavior.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation escalation, such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP if the flood volume increases.
