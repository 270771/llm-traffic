Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple TCP and UDP connection attempts but no ICMP traffic entries.
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets recorded, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The only UDP entries present do not indicate ICMP traffic or flooding patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic context or taxonomy is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class applies here.
- The absence of ICMP echo requests excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next Steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or enabling detailed ICMP logging.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP-related alerts to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
