Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.19.170 and destination IP 45.213.168.75 for any unusual traffic patterns or repeated ICMP Echo Requests in other logs to rule out reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
