Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping requests. However, there is only a single ICMP Echo Request from 54.249.88.129 to 163.45.192.159 with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests that characterize a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Recommendation:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. If such patterns emerge, investigate further for volumetric ICMP traffic spikes.
