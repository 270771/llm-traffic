Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP connections from 45.121.95.154 to various destination IPs on port 5060, but these are UDP flows, not ICMP.
- There is no indication of ICMP traffic in the logs, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The protocol field shows mostly UDP and TCP traffic; no ICMP protocol entries are present.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the traffic pattern (many UDP connections to port 5060) could suggest SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts, which should be investigated separately.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060, as this may indicate SIP scanning or a UDP flood attack.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Apply heuristics related to UDP flood or SIP scanning once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
