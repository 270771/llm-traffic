Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 packet from 222.135.78.24 to 133.251.176.52, but no evidence of high volume or repeated requests indicative of flooding.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (222.135.78.24) could be a prudent next step to detect potential escalation.
