Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connection attempts (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic entries.  
- Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.  
- The connections show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.  

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- No explicit heuristics or taxonomy entries are available in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.  
- The observed traffic pattern aligns with reconnaissance or scanning activity (TCP SYN scans), which typically falls under heuristic categories related to network scanning or probing.  

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs generating multiple SYN attempts without completion for potential scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection attempts.
