Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values observed in the conn.log snippet are 0, 3, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 13 = Timestamp Request, type 0 = Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-based issues or misconfigurations, but no immediate ping flood mitigation is required. If high ICMP traffic of type 8 appears later, re-evaluate for ping flood indicators.
