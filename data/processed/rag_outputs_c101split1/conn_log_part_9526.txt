Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would be identified by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the provided snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present in the conn.log snippet.
- The traffic consists mainly of UDP and TCP connection attempts with no indication of ICMP echo requests or floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the defining characteristic of a ping flood is absent.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned.
- The absence of ICMP echo requests means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next Steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to confirm no ping flood activity.
