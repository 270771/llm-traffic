Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," which may indicate network issues or other non-attack conditions rather than a flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of misconfigurations or other network problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
