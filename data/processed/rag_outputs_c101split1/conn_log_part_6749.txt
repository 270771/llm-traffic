Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.40.144 to destination 163.68.75.132, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 8 is the only relevant type for ping floods, and the log does not show multiple or rapid ICMP type 8 packets.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in ICMP flags or payload sizes.
