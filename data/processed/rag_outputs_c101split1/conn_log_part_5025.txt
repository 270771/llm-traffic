Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. All connections are TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) or normal UDP queries, none matching ICMP ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The numerous TCP SYN attempts with no completion (S0) could suggest scanning or reconnaissance activity, which typically falls under heuristic classes related to network scanning or reconnaissance.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 states) for potential scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify if these IPs are repeatedly probing services, and consider blocking or rate-limiting suspicious sources.
