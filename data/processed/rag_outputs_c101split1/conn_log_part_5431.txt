Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found.
- The connections show mostly SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the closest classification for these TCP SYN attempts would be reconnaissance or scanning activity, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.x range) for potential scanning or probing.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on these TCP connection attempts.
