Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it cannot be a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single instance, not a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would be indicative of a ping flood. Investigate if any other logs show a surge in ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies.
