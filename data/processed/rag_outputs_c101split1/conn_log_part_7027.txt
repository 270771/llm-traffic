Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various ICMP types indicated by the field after the destination IP (values 0, 1). None of the entries have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Entry 1: ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply)  
- Entry 2: ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable)  
- Entry 3: ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply)  

Since no ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which relies on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) messages for potential network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
