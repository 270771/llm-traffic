Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single instance with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that a ping flood requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from one or more sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (123.140.64.6) to the destination (202.250.197.215).  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated OTH (other) connection states that might indicate scanning or reconnaissance.
