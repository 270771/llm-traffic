Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 157.206.195.143 to 3.192.82.251, which is a normal ping request.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 1 (Echo Reply) from 157.206.133.122 to 94.232.18.20, which is not type 8 and therefore cannot be a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, since no ping flood is detected, no immediate security response is required.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other anomaly logs if they appear later.
