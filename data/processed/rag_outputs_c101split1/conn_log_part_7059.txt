Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts correspond to heuristic classes related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the network for ICMP traffic separately, as it is not captured here.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Analyze TCP SYN flood or scanning activity if connection attempts continue at high rates.
