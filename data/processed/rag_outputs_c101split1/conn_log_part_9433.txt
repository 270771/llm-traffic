Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the same destination IP 3.199.185.249 from various source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for volumetric ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 157.206.166.129, 157.206.166.32, 157.206.73.243, 157.206.166.61, 157.206.5.153, 157.206.73.196
  - Destination: 3.199.185.249
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host 3.199.185.249 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly.
