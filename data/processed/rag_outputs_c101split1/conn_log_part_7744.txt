Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single packet with no indication of flooding or high volume.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 3 traffic typically indicates network errors, not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if it sends multiple echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs or anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
