Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would have a protocol number 1 and ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping floods. The provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP protocol entries; all entries are either UDP (protocol 17) or TCP (protocol 6).
- The UDP traffic is mostly on port 5060 (SIP signaling) and port 53 (DNS), with no indication of ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here.
- The traffic pattern does not match ping flood characteristics (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets).

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or other VoIP-related reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- If ICMP traffic appears, verify ICMP type to confirm ping flood presence.
