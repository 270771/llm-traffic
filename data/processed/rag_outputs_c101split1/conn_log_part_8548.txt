Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.134.85, 133.227.218.0, 133.227.226.1, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination IP (54.209.24.157) in a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical).
- This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target matches the classic distributed ping flood attack pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination in a short time."
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.227.134.85, 133.227.218.0, 133.227.226.1, etc.)
- Destination IP: 54.209.24.157
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.209.24.157.
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests to the affected host if business operations allow.
6. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and apply appropriate network access controls.
