Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `8` for both entries, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern of traffic shown (only two ICMP echo requests from two different source IPs to the same destination IP) do not indicate a flood. A ping flood typically involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame from one or multiple sources targeting a victim to overwhelm it.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is normal ICMP echo requests without volume or rate anomalies, no attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, consider correlating with network performance metrics or alerts from IDS/IPS systems for early detection.
