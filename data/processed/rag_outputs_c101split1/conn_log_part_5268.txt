Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not observed at all, the condition for a ping flood is not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could be related to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this requires further data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to detect any ping flood attempts not captured here.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP Echo Requests to catch ping floods in the future.
