Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state (connection attempts without completion) for possible SYN flood or scanning activity. This could be a different type of DoS or reconnaissance attack. Collect ICMP logs or enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
