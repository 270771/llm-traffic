Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP code field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm a target.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 traffic to ensure it is legitimate (e.g., Echo Replies or error messages). Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or other suspicious ICMP traffic patterns.
