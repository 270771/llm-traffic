Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 0, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," neither of which are used to initiate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other connectivity issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to rule out other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
