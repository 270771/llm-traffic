Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 218.53.148.241 to 133.105.237.172, but it shows only 1 packet with 28 bytes, which is insufficient volume or frequency to indicate a flood. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service" or "Flooding Attack."

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP. Investigate if 218.53.148.241 repeatedly sends large numbers of ICMP Echo Requests. Also, verify if ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
