Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is "3" for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this is normal ICMP error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes is recommended to detect future ping flood attempts.
