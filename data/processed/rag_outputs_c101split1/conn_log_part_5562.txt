Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since no ICMP traffic is logged, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are visible, there is no evidence of a ping flood.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided TCP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN scans or connection attempts with no established sessions (S0 or OTH states).

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- Typically, a ping flood heuristic would be based on high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ICMP floods.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or other ICMP types.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for alerts related to ICMP anomalies.
