Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an atypical or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP echo replies are observed without corresponding echo requests in the logs. Verify if additional logs show echo requests or unusual ICMP traffic volume. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs (172.23.68.231 and 203.78.170.70).
