Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP, 54.254.197.94, targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all around timestamp 1641013226). All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The rapid succession and volume of ICMP Echo Requests to various targets is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior matches the classic heuristic of "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," which is commonly classified under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.254.197.94  
- Target IPs: 202.250.249.247, 202.250.230.225, 202.250.230.226, 202.250.204.127, 202.250.250.121, 202.250.230.254, 202.250.250.125  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.197.94 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.  
3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools, such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS rules.  
5. Conduct a broader investigation to determine if this is part of a larger coordinated attack or botnet activity.
