Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or denial-of-service via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, S0 states correspond to "Connection attempt failed" and may relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm absence of ping flood.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets in future logs.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any ICMP-related alerts.
