Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.18.108 and destination IP 104.211.16.161 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, especially if multiple ICMP types are observed. Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
