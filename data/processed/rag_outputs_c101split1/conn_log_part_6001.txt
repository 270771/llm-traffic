Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the sixth column after source IP and port) is 0 and 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that if the ICMP type is not 8, it is not a ping flood, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure it is not symptomatic of other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns that may indicate a future ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.
