Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 202.125.201.18 to 59.6.205.199 with ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP record shows traffic from 133.227.136.80 to 206.130.113.228 with ICMP type 13, which is a "Timestamp Request," also not an echo request.  
- Since neither record has ICMP type 8, these are not ping (echo) requests and thus do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types suggest diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and frequency of ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics and not part of a reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.
