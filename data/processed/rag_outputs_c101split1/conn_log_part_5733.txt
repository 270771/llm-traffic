Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (echo request). Specifically, the ICMP type values observed are 0, 1, 3, and 11, none of which correspond to the echo request type required for a ping flood attack. Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), type 1 (host unreachable), and type 11 (time exceeded) messages, as these can indicate network scanning, misconfigurations, or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to determine if these ICMP messages are symptomatic of other network problems or reconnaissance activities.
