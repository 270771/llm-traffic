Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP packets, but the ICMP type values are mostly 3 and 11, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectively. Only two entries have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type used in ping floods. However, these type 8 entries show zero packets or bytes transferred (0 packets, 0 bytes), indicating no flood-level traffic volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would require sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as these may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable or expired packets.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
