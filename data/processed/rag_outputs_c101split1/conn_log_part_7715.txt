Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 11, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.161, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics look for high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window to confirm no flooding.  
- Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP unreachable or time exceeded messages that might indicate network issues or other attack types.  
- If ICMP type 11 traffic is unusually high, consider investigating potential traceroute or network scanning activity.
