Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 0, not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood criteria. The traffic shows ICMP packets but not echo requests, so it does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the lack of anomalies and the ICMP type mismatch, no attack is present.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent other ICMP-based activity or benign network behavior. Specifically, verify the ICMP type codes in full logs and monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.
