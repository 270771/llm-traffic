Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection record. ICMP type 3 messages are typically error responses, not attack traffic.

No heuristics or taxonomy data are available to assign here. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages or other ICMP types, and checking for volume anomalies or related connection patterns.
