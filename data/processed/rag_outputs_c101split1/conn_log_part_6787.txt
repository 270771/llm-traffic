Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (223.97.207.193) to detect potential reconnaissance or flooding attempts.
