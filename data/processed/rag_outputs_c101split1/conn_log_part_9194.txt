Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.  
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.  
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics (commonly heuristic #1 or #2 in many taxonomies), but this is not confirmed.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.140, 45.121.95.154) for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP Echo Request floods or other anomalies.
