Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 1 messages are being generatedâ€”this could indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
