Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 113.0.144.93 to 133.105.111.73 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet recorded (count=1), not a flood or high volume of echo requests.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or volume consistent with a ping flood attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. Generally, ping floods are identified by high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic for possible traceroute or network issues, as it may indicate network path problems rather than an attack.
