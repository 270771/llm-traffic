Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 163.45.248.102, but it shows only a single packet (count=1), which does not indicate flooding.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no known suspicious patterns are detected here.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests for volume spikes from 172.23.68.231 could be a prudent next step to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
