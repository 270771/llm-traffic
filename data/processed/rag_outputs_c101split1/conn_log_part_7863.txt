Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies. Monitoring for high-rate ICMP type 8 packets is essential to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
