Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria. The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single instance with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, this traffic does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same IPs to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic separately as it may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but is unrelated to ping floods.
