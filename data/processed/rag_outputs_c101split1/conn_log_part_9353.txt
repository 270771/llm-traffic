Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP connections from 45.121.95.154 to various IPs on port 5060, but none of these entries indicate ICMP traffic.
- The protocol field is either `udp` or `tcp`; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not indicated here.
- The traffic pattern resembles a possible UDP scanning or SIP-related activity (port 5060 is commonly used for SIP), but this is not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided.
- Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, no ping flood heuristic applies.
- The observed traffic could be investigated under heuristics related to UDP scanning or SIP abuse if such context were available.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 on multiple destination IPs for potential SIP scanning or abuse.
- Correlate with SIP logs or firewall alerts to determine if this is reconnaissance or a different attack type.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request floods separately.
