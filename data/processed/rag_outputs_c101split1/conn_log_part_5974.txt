Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks like Smurf or ICMP flood.

No immediate attack is present. However, monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (133.243.206.29) to the destination (104.119.211.249) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
