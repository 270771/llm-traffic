Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and timing in the snippet show only two isolated ICMP echo requests from different source IPs to the same destination IP, with no indication of rapid, repeated requests typical of a ping flood. There is no anomaly data or heuristic context indicating suspicious behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristics are provided, no taxonomy class can be assigned. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns such as high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from a single source or multiple sources targeting one destination in a short time frame.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs. If a surge in ICMP type 8 packets is detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance activity.
