Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 0, 1, and 3, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and other ICMP types present, as they may indicate network scanning, misconfigurations, or other issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to better classify and respond to other ICMP-related anomalies.
