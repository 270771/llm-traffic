Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack types can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP rates or patterns. If scanning activity is suspected from the SYN-only TCP connections, consider applying heuristics related to port scanning or reconnaissance.
