Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The connections show mostly SYN scans or failed TCP handshakes (S0 state), but these do not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is detected, no immediate ICMP-specific response is required.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated SYN connection attempts (S0 states) from IPs like 89.247.69.* and 45.121.95.154, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies) and classify under "Reconnaissance" or "Scanning" taxonomy.
- Monitor for any escalation or changes in traffic patterns, especially if ICMP traffic appears later.
