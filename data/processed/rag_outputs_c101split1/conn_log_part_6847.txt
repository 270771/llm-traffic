Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x range. All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid succession of these echo requests to many different hosts within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical) matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #3: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.236.220.60  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.65.71, 163.45.16.136, 163.45.133.114, 163.45.65.85, 163.45.176.42, 163.45.109.16, 163.45.16.180, 163.45.137.36, 163.45.68.109, 163.45.131.36, 163.45.191.103, 163.45.222.236, 163.45.130.230, 163.45.176.145, 163.45.185.70, 163.45.40.40, 163.45.185.143, 163.45.26.214, 163.45.108.39, 163.45.131.217, 163.45.48.67, 163.45.13.225  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.236.220.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or similar ICMP flood patterns from other sources.  
3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted IP ranges to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies to mitigate future ping flood attacks.  
5. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed and take appropriate remediation steps.
