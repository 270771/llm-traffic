Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 202.250.230.254 to 167.46.181.114 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second record shows ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request), also not type 8.  
Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by these entries. Both records have the connection state "OTH" (other), which often indicates non-standard or incomplete connections but does not alone signify an attack.

Heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types were to be considered suspicious, they might fall under general reconnaissance or anomalous ICMP traffic categories.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets elsewhere in the logs to rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns, especially repeated ICMP error messages (type 11) or timestamp requests (type 13), which could indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
