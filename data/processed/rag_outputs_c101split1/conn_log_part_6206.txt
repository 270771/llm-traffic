Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 11 and 13, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match the ICMP Echo Request pattern required for a ping flood, no ping flood or related attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (4.24.207.8 and 131.140.13.38) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, as ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) can sometimes indicate network scanning or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests for proactive detection.
