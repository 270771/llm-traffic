Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the packet counts are very low (30 packets each) and the duration is very short (around 7 milliseconds), indicating no sustained flood. Also, no anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest abnormal volume or rate typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates or volume from these IPs. If packet counts or frequency spike significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
