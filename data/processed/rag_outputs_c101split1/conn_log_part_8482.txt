Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.206.127.231, 157.206.156.19, 157.206.41.73, etc.) are sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 44.198.161.223 and 163.84.73.84) within a very short time frame (all timestamps are within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a few destinations is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target hosts.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign the most likely heuristic as **Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood**.
- Taxonomy class: **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.206.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.206.127.231, 157.206.156.19, 157.206.41.73, etc.).
- Destination IPs: Primarily 44.198.161.223 and 163.84.73.84.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16).
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor affected hosts (44.198.161.223, 163.84.73.84) for service degradation and apply host-based firewall rules to limit ICMP traffic.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised machines part of a botnet.
6. Prepare incident response to mitigate potential collateral damage and communicate with stakeholders about the ongoing attack.
