Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. Most connections show TCP SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the S0 state typically corresponds to failed connection attempts, often related to reconnaissance or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated S0 states (e.g., 89.247.69.x range) for potential scanning behavior.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to detect any possible ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review existing ICMP monitoring rules to capture Echo Request floods if they occur.
