Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) and therefore cannot be a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8. A ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), which are absent here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, these entries likely represent normal ICMP error and reply traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any surge in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.  
- If ICMP Echo Requests increase significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
