Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the second entry has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not a ping request. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the limited data, no other attack type can be confidently identified.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods. Collect more detailed logs or flow data to analyze traffic volume and patterns over time.
