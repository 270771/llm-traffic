Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry (from 133.243.19.169 to 152.26.214.210) has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry (from 133.227.63.197 to 3.23.69.72) has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping), but there is only a single packet logged, not a flood or high volume of echo requests.  
- No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious volume or behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the default assumption is that a ping flood requires multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, which is not observed here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.243.19.169 sending ICMP type 11 messages if unusual network behavior is observed.
