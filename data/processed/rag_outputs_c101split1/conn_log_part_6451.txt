Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 143.187.187.184 to 163.45.255.56, which is a normal ping request.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) from 62.163.209.38 to 203.78.143.78, which is not an Echo Request and therefore not part of a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to network diagnostics or routing issues, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages if unusual volumes are observed, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or routing loops.
