Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 0 in the "id.orig_p" and "id.resp_p" fields (both zero), but the critical field for ICMP type is not explicitly shown here. However, the problem states that if the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), it is not a ping flood. Since the log does not indicate ICMP type 8 anywhere and the connection states are "OTH" (other), these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type field explicitly in future logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes with type 8, re-assess for ping flood.  
- Consider enabling more detailed ICMP logging or packet capture to identify potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
