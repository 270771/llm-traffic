Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and no ICMP traffic is logged here, no ping flood can be detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state) but no sustained or volumetric ICMP traffic typical of ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP Echo Request floods are occurring. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
