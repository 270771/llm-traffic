Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping), but there is only a single instance with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, this does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, the default assumption is that ICMP type 8 alone is insufficient to indicate a ping flood without volume or frequency anomalies.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network traffic volume and rate metrics to detect volumetric anomalies.
