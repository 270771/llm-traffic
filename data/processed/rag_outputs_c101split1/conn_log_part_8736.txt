Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 0, 1, or other values, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not represent a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with types 0 and 1, which correspond to echo replies and destination unreachable messages, respectively.  
- Verify if these ICMP messages are part of normal network operations or indicative of other issues such as network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
