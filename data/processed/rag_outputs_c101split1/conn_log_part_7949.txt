Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry from 203.78.136.178 to 170.17.229.153 has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry from 133.243.102.113 to 174.95.41.114 has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request, but there is only a single packet logged with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target are evident, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP echo requests or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 message from 203.78.136.178 as it may indicate network routing or TTL issues but is unrelated to ping flooding.
