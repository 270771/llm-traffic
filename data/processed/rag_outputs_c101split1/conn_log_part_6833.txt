Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," which are normal control messages or could indicate other network conditions but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. Given the absence of anomalies and the ICMP types observed, no attack is currently detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing ICMP type 3 and 10 messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
