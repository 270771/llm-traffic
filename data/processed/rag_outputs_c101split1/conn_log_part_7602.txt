Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.229, which is a valid ping request.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) from 202.250.230.254 to 208.186.57.247, which is not an Echo Request and therefore not part of a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic if it is unexpected, as it may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but is not a ping flood.
