Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since no ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, the fundamental condition for detecting a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion (S0) for possible TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging or capture to monitor for potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to detect other attack types such as SYN floods or port scans.
