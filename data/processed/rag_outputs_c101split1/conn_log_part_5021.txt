Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP traffic, the heuristic for ping flood detection (ICMP type 8 flood) cannot be applied.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided TCP connection logs, which mostly show SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful connections, possibly normal scanning or benign connection attempts.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures specifically for ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Monitor for unusual high-rate ICMP Echo Requests or other anomalies in network traffic.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to complement this analysis.
