Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP: 44.202.241.89.
- Multiple distinct source IPs from the 133.227.x.x subnet are sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The volume and concurrency of ICMP type 8 packets aimed at one target strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ping requests, matching known ping flood attack behavior.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources targeting a single victim.
- Assign heuristic number: 101 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service" (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 44.202.241.89 (ICMP has no ports).
- Attackers: Multiple IPs in 133.227.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.227.226.1, 133.227.166.232, 133.227.154.251, etc.).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.241.89.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo responses on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
