Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show a type value of 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the given traffic does not contain type 8, it does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 0 corresponds to Echo Reply, which is normal response traffic rather than an attack vector.

Next steps: Investigate why there are multiple ICMP Echo Replies without corresponding Echo Requests in the logs, as this could indicate asymmetric logging or other network issues. Also, verify if other ICMP types or traffic patterns show suspicious volume or behavior.
