Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 1 respectively (fields indicating ICMP type are the 4th and 10th fields after IP addresses and ports). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not represent ping requests and therefore do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to Time Exceeded (type 11) and Echo Reply (type 0 or 1 depending on implementation), which are normal ICMP traffic types and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP traffic over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or network issues. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
