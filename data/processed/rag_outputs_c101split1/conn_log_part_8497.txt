Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 4 and 0 (fields 17 and 18), not type 8 which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping). Since neither entry has ICMP type 8, these packets are not echo requests and therefore do not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP types other than 8 do not indicate ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 4 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic to ensure it is expected in the network context.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other protocols.
