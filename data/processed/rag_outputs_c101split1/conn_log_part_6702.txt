Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log entry indicates the connection state as "OTH" and no packet counts or byte counts suggestive of high-volume ICMP echo requests (type 8). Additionally, the absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents direct correlation to known ping flood patterns.

Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8 (echo request), this traffic does not match the defining characteristic of a ping flood attack. The connection appears to be a single or low-volume ICMP exchange rather than a flood.

No heuristic or taxonomy is applicable here due to lack of anomaly data. However, the "OTH" state typically indicates a connection that did not complete a normal handshake, which could warrant monitoring but is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed packet-level data to confirm ICMP types and volume. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request rates from the source IP (2600:d3fa:4478:cfc:ff60:63dc:84f:ecdc) to the destination (2001:fcff:fa79:c0fd:e:7ff:fe1e:3a07).
