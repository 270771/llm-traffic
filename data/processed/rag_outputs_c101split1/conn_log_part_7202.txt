Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values are 0, 13, 10, and 0, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood is repeated ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 10 = Router Advertisement, 13 = Timestamp Request) suggest normal or other benign ICMP activity rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual volume or patterns in other logs.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes or other anomalies appear, correlate with additional network data for potential DoS or reconnaissance activity.
