Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP types are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 8, but the second entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not part of a ping flood. However, the first entryâ€™s ICMP type 8 traffic volume (32 bytes over 0.269 seconds) is low and isolated, not indicative of a flood pattern (which would show high volume, rapid repeated ICMP type 8 packets).

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained, high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 for repeated ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window to confirm or rule out scanning or low-rate probing.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types that could indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack pattern.
