Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second log entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), also not type 8.  
- Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types suggest network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets elsewhere in the logs to rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in Echo Requests.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any alerts related to ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack.
