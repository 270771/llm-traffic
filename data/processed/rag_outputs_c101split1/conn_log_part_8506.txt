Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the "icmp" protocol and the ICMP code/type fields. Here, the ICMP type is shown as "1" (the 6th and 10th columns after IP addresses), which corresponds to "ICMP type 1" (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 1 traffic typically indicates network errors or unreachable hosts, which may warrant further investigation but is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or network issue causing these errors. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
