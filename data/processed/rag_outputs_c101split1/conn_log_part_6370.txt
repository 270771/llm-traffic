Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values are 0, 1, 3, or missing, but none are type 8, which is required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP Echo Requests, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the provided data. The connection states are mostly OTH (other), and no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 rules out ping flood heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs with unusual ICMP types (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable) for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance. Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
