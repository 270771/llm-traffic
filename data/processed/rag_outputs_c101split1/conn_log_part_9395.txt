Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP: 3.39.157.141.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.124.185, 157.206.75.253, 157.206.255.134, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession within the same second (timestamp 1641013233).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources flooding one target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP flood attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 3.39.157.141 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources from the 157.206.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.206.124.185, 157.206.75.253, 157.206.255.134, etc.)
- ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.39.157.141.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking IP addresses if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce impact.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
