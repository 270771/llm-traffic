Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code fields, which are all "-", meaning no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the OTH (Other) connection state and verify if this ICMP traffic corresponds to legitimate control or error messages. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or increased ICMP traffic volume from 163.45.101.190 to 80.66.206.215 would be prudent to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
