Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed primarily at a few destination IPs, notably 44.198.161.223 and 163.84.73.84. Multiple distinct source IPs are sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession within the same timestamp window (1641013226.x), which is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern. The presence of many OTH (other) connection states with zero bytes transferred but repeated ICMP type 8 packets further supports this.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-rate ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #3 in many IDS taxonomies: "ICMP Flooding").  
- Taxonomy class: "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack" under ICMP-based flooding attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IPs: 44.198.161.223, 163.84.73.84  
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.206.x.x, 133.x.x.x, 130.x.x.x, and 172.23.x.x ranges.  
- ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting the victim IPs.  
2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.  
3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporary blackholing or sinkholing traffic to affected IPs if service disruption is severe.  
6. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or outage.
