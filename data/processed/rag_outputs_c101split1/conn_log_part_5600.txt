Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 0 and 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood, none of these entries represent ping flood activity. Types 0 and 1 correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable respectively, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP responses or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or patterns in other logs.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- If ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or other error types increase abnormally, consider investigating potential network scanning or misconfiguration.
