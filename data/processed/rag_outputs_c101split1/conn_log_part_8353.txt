Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.206.29 to destination 195.146.118.190, with a single packet (count=1).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 10, which are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no known suspicious patterns are detected here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.243.206.29 if repeated Echo Requests appear in subsequent logs.  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, establish baseline traffic patterns for ICMP to detect deviations.
