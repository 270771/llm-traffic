Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is observable here.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly for any high-rate ICMP Echo Requests to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.  
- Monitor for SYN flood or port scanning activity given the many S0 TCP states, which could indicate reconnaissance or other DoS attempts.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP traffic monitoring to detect ping floods in future analyses.
