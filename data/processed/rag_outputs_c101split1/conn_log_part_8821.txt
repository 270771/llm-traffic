Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.222.41.57 from multiple source IPs within the 133.227.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.227.213.1, 133.227.213.11, 133.227.209.5, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 52.222.41.57 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.227.0.0/16 to the victim IP 52.222.41.57.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to assist in filtering or blackholing attack traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
