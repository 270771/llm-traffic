Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 1 and 0, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping requests, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic. Type 1 is ICMP Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, which are not indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP traffic and no other suspicious patterns, no attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for other unusual activity or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate network issues or other attack types. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or spikes in traffic volume.
