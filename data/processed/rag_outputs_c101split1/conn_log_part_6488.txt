Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and timing in the snippet are minimal (only two packets within a very short timeframe), and there is no indication of excessive or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no anomalies are detected and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no attack classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation. Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs.
