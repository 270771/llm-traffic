Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8, which is Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the flags indicate no retransmissions or unusual packet counts that would suggest flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network scanning activity, as ICMP traffic with unusual flags or states can indicate reconnaissance.
