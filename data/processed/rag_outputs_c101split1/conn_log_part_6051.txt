Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3` respectively, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network or host unreachable errors.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood but rather normal or error-related ICMP messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or routing issues.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
