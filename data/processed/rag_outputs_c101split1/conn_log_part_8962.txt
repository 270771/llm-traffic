Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood. Each entry shows a single packet (`-` in bytes fields, count 1), and the timestamps are very close but do not represent a high-rate burst typical of a ping flood. Also, the connection state is `OTH` (other), not indicative of sustained or overwhelming traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest this traffic is malicious or part of a ping flood. Without evidence of excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target or rapid repeated requests, this traffic appears normal or benign.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP echo request rates from these IPs to the target IP 3.197.247.113.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for potential denial-of-service symptoms.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs.
