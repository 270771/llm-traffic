Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 11 and 13, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp Request) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match the ICMP Echo Request pattern required for a ping flood, no ping flood or related ICMP flood attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and purpose of ICMP type 11 and 13 packets to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics or time synchronization attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 or 13 persist, consider deeper packet inspection to rule out other reconnaissance or misconfiguration issues.
