Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.200 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet logged, not a flood or high volume of echo requests.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination are present, which is required to identify a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no ping flood is detected, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if ICMP type 11 packets indicate possible traceroute activity or network issues but not a ping flood.
