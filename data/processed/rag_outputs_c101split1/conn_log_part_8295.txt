Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the volume and timing do not indicate floodingâ€”only a single connection with a short duration and normal packet size is present. The second entry has ICMP type 3, which is a destination unreachable message, not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of repeated or high-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic with high frequency or volume from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or unusual ICMP error messages for other network issues.
