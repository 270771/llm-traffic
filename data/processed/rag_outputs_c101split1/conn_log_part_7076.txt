Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily a flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomalies are reported, no immediate attack is evident. However, the presence of ICMP Echo Replies without corresponding Echo Requests could warrant further investigation into network scanning or misconfigured hosts.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns to identify deviations.
