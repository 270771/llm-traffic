Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

The ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded," which may indicate network issues or traceroute-like activity but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. However, these ICMP types could warrant further investigation into network misconfigurations or routing problems.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP type 3/11 messages from the same sources, and correlate with other logs to rule out network scanning or reconnaissance activities.
