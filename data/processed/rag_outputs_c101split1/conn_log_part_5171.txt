Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity. Collect ICMP logs to verify if any ICMP traffic is present. Establish heuristics for TCP SYN flood detection and monitor for anomalies in connection states.
