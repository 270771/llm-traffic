Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type fields are 3, 128, and 11, which correspond to Destination Unreachable, Echo Reply, and Time Exceeded respectively. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, if these ICMP types are seen in unusual volumes or patterns, they could indicate other issues such as network scanning or misconfigurations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.243.107.63, 2001:b744:c5e1:a785:310:7c2f:2912:99a1, 203.78.136.178) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other ICMP types.
