Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections. Two of them have ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and one has ICMP type 10, which is not relevant for ping floods. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding: each record shows a single connection with a count of 1, no repeated rapid requests from the same source to the same destination, and no indication of excessive traffic or resource exhaustion.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate.  
- Investigate if any other logs or network monitoring tools report unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If ICMP traffic spikes or multiple connections with ICMP type 8 appear rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood.
