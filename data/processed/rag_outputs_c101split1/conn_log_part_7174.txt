Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `1` (indicated by the destination port field for ICMP), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.105.128.252 and destination IP 184.145.225.213 for potential network issues or other ICMP-related anomalies, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
