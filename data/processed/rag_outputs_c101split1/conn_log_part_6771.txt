Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.241.89) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 44.202.241.89  
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.227.64.249, 133.227.139.2, 133.227.235.106, etc.)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.241.89.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other DoS vectors.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
