Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 0 (indicated by the ICMP code field being 0 and no explicit type 8 for echo request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state "OTH" indicates other or incomplete connections, which may warrant further investigation for unusual ICMP activity but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
