Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 13, 8, and 1 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record from source IP 163.45.124.155 to destination 182.47.218.152 with only 1 packet and 28 bytes transferred, which does not indicate flooding or high-volume traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high packet counts excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) or type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic is unusual in volume or pattern, as these could indicate other reconnaissance or network issues.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP-based attacks.
