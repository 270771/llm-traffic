Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood, but further investigation into the cause of ICMP type 11 messages could be warranted if unusual volumes persist. Specifically, monitor for spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
