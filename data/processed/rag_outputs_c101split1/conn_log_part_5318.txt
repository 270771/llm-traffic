Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect ping floods. Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to monitor for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
