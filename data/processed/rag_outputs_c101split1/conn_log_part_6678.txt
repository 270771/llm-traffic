Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with a type field present is the third log line, which shows ICMP type 9 (router advertisement), not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The other ICMP entries have type 0 or 1, which are not echo requests either.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no known suspicious patterns or taxonomy classes can be directly referenced.  
- The connection states (OTH) and flags do not indicate a flood pattern or excessive echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 sending ICMP type 9 packets to 104.201.127.230, as router advertisements can be abused in certain network attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from any IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If anomalies appear, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance.

Heuristic and taxonomy: Not applicable here due to lack of data and no ping flood detected.
