Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8. A ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm the target, which is absent here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ICMP Echo Requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from any source IP.  
- Review network baseline for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns.
