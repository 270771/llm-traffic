Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic likely represents traceroute or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (221.65.215.210 and 202.101.171.238) for unusual ICMP activity patterns or volume over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would be more indicative of ping flood behavior.
