Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 0 and 11, but neither entry has ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. ICMP type 0 is echo reply, and type 11 is time exceeded, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ICMP echo requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) messages to ensure no routing loops or traceroute-like activity is causing network issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
