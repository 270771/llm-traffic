Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic would have protocol number 1, but the Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP (protocol 6) and UDP (protocol 17) connections. There are no entries with protocol 1 (ICMP), and thus no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are present. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, a ping flood cannot be occurring.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The logs show multiple failed connection attempts (S0 state) on TCP and UDP ports, which may suggest scanning or reconnaissance activity, but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed connection attempts (S0) correspond to heuristic categories related to scanning or reconnaissance, not flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the repeated failed connection attempts on UDP port 5060 (SIP) from IP 45.121.95.154 and others, as these may indicate scanning or probing activity. Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
