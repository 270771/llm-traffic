Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest any other suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IP.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
- If TCP or UDP anomalies arise, analyze those with appropriate heuristics and taxonomy once available.
