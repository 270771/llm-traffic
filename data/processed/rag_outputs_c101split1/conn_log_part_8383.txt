Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and none are logged here, no ping flood is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy classes are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Typically, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.153, 167.46.181.116) for potential scanning activity.  
- Check for ICMP traffic in other logs or timeframes to rule out ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect possible ICMP-based attacks.
