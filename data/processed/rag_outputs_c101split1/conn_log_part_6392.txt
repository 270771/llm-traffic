Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs that include ICMP protocol details to confirm the absence of ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
