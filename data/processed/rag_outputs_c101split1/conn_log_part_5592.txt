Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The ICMP type field is the 6th field after the source IP and port. For the first entry, the ICMP type is `10` (field value `3` is the source port, next is destination port `66.15.63.118` which is an IP, so the ICMP type is the field after source and destination ports). However, the exact ICMP type is not explicitly shown as `8` (Echo Request) in either entry. The second entry shows ICMP type `1`, which corresponds to "ICMP Destination Unreachable," not an Echo Request. Since only ICMP type 8 indicates ping requests, and neither entry has type 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions:

- ICMP type 8 = Echo Request (ping)
- ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable
- ICMP type 3 = Destination Unreachable (various codes)

The first entryâ€™s ICMP type appears to be 3, which is not a ping request.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (157.206.194.20 and 157.206.194.66) for other suspicious activity, as ICMP Destination Unreachable messages can indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential ping floods early.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no classification is assigned.  
- ICMP type 1 and 3 messages typically fall under network error or reconnaissance categories, not flooding attacks.
