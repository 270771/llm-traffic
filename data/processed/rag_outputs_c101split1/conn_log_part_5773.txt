Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the ICMP type and lack of anomalies, this traffic appears benign or part of normal ICMP communication.

No immediate security response is required, but monitoring for a surge in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (41.48.32.251) to the destination (202.250.217.129) is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
