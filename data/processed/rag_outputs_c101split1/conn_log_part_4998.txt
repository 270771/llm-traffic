Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP connections logged. Moreover, even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here. The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any alerts related to ICMP or other DoS attack vectors.
