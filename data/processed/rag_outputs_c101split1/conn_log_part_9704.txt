Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the only type 8 record is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 163.45.22.39, but it appears as a single connection event with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks fall under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic patterns involving high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. If volume spikes or multiple connections with ICMP type 8 are detected, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review network traffic for other DoS indicators given the presence of ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) which may suggest network issues or other attack types.
