Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack.

No immediate security incident is detected here. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential ping floods in the future.
