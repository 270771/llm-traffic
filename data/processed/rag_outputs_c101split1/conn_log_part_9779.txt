Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 1. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood attack, but neither entry has type 8. Type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types, this traffic likely represents error or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why these ICMP error messages are occurring, as frequent ICMP type 3 or 1 messages can indicate network misconfigurations or connectivity issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
