Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks. Also, enable or review anomaly detection rules that monitor ICMP Echo Requests to catch ping floods early.
