Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections with no indication of ICMP traffic, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of SYN attempts further to rule out TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
