Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping) packets. However, the connection states are all "OTH" (other), and the counts of packets and bytes are very low (all zeros except for a single packet count of 1). This indicates isolated ping attempts rather than a high-volume flood typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal traffic volume, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from these IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity or if the traffic correlates with other anomalies.  
- Consider enabling rate-limiting or alerting on ICMP traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.
