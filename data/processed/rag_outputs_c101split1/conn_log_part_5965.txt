Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the TCP SYN packets with flags like S0 and SH, the traffic may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state) for possible SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further insight into suspicious connection attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data, but the current evidence excludes ping flood.
