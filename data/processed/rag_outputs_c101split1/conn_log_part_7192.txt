Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific monitoring to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Review firewall or IDS/IPS alerts for ICMP anomalies if available.
