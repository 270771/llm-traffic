Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0, 3, 8, and 11.  
- Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, only one record has type 8:  
  `58.13.7.9 (src) -> 202.250.232.253 (dst), ICMP type 8`  
- However, this single ICMP Echo Request does not indicate flooding. The other entries are types 0 (Echo Reply), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not ping flood indicators.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match ping flood heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 58.13.7.9 if it continues sending ICMP Echo Requests at a high rate.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or ICMP traffic inspection if suspicious patterns emerge.
