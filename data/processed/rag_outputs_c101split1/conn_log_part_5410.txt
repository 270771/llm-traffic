Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The log records connection attempts with TCP flags (mostly S0 - SYN sent but no response), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not ICMP traffic.

Since no ICMP traffic is present, no ping flood or ICMP-based attack is detected.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could be related to reconnaissance or scanning activity, which typically falls under heuristic classes for network scanning or reconnaissance.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts with no response (S0 state) as potential port scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or other network monitoring tools to confirm scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any subsequent ICMP traffic or other attack vectors.
