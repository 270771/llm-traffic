Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no explicit ICMP type field in the snippet, but the Zeek conn.log format indicates the ICMP type is in the "id.orig_p" and "id.resp_p" fields, which here are both 3. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply.

The traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack. Further investigation could include checking for repeated ICMP type 3 messages to identify possible network issues or misconfigurations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood.
