Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (indicated by the 4th and 6th fields, which are 3, 1, 11, 0, etc., but none explicitly show type 8 which is Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8 in any record, these are not ICMP Echo Requests and therefore do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with types other than 8 to determine if it corresponds to other ICMP-based activities or potential reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal traffic volume from these IPs.  
- If suspicious behavior arises, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or denial-of-service as per organizational guidelines.
