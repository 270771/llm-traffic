Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, no ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, as many TCP connections here show SYN_SENT (S0) states, which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or IDS rules to detect ICMP-based anomalies.
