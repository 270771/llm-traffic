Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be identified by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to various 133.105.150.x addresses on port 5060 is consistent with SIP signaling traffic, not ICMP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.

Other observations:
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP) from a single source to multiple destinations could indicate scanning or SIP-related abuse but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristics or taxonomy, the best classification for this traffic is normal or potentially suspicious SIP traffic, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 on port 5060 for possible SIP scanning or abuse.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP Echo Request floods if suspected.
