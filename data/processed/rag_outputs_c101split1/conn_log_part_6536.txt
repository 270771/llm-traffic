Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets from IP 110.97.253.227 targeting multiple hosts on port 445, as this could indicate a scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Establish heuristics for detecting SYN scans or other TCP-based anomalies since no ping flood heuristics apply here.
