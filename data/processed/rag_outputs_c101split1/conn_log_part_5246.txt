Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other attack type related to ping floods is evident.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture potential ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for other types of volumetric or connection-based anomalies in TCP/UDP traffic that might indicate different attack vectors.
