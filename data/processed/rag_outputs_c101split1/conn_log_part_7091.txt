Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal connection attempts or failed TCP/UDP handshakes (S0 states), which may indicate scanning or benign connection failures but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from single IPs.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.  

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of relevant data.
