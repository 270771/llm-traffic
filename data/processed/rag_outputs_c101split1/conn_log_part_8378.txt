Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no explicit type 8), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP but not type 8, it does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 and destination IP 147.167.239.202 for other suspicious activity or repeated ICMP Echo Replies that could indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other hosts.
