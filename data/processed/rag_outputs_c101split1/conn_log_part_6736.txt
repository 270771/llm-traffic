Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3` for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood mitigation. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 3 messages could be considered if network issues arise.
