Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest alternative attack types. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but these do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
