Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are both 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 ("Echo Request") which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 3 messages are typically network error messages, not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP Destination Unreachable messages; this could indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
