Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the ICMP code field being 0 and no explicit type 8 for echo request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the traffic does not indicate a ping flood or any other clear attack pattern from the given data.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) or abnormal traffic volume that could indicate a developing ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.
