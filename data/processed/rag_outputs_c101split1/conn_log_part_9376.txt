Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after IPs and ports), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
