Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.  
- The protocol field is either `udp` (17) or `tcp` (6); no ICMP (1) entries are present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.  
- The UDP traffic is mostly on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), and TCP traffic is on various ports, none related to ICMP.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs, as this could indicate SIP scanning or a different type of UDP flood.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Apply heuristics related to UDP floods or SIP anomalies once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
