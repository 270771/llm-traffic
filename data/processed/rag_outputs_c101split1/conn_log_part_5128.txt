Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and the presence of multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN failures (S0 state) suggest possible scanning or connection attempts rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures (S0) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with IDS alerts or other logs for scanning heuristics (commonly heuristic #1: Port Scan, taxonomy class: Reconnaissance). Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
