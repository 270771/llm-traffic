Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate a ping flood attack. No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP Echo Reply communication.

No attack is detected, but further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (133.243.179.13) or to the same destination IP (118.116.244.150) to detect potential future ping floods.
