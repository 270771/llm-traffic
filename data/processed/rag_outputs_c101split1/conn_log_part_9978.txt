Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood, and the observed traffic appears to be normal TCP/UDP connection attempts, some with failed handshakes (S0, RSTR states), which may warrant investigation for scanning or reconnaissance but not ping flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 on multiple hosts, as this may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP echo request floods to detect potential ping flood attacks.
