Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the only non-zero ICMP type is 10 in one entry, which is not type 8. Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no other suspicious indicators, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 10 traffic (which corresponds to "Router Advertisement") to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse. Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other unusual ICMP types that could indicate evolving attack patterns.
