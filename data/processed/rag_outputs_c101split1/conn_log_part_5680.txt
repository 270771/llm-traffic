Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types are frequent or unusual, they might indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messages, not a flood attack.

Next steps:  
Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to determine if there is a network misconfiguration or a different type of ICMP-based anomaly. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
