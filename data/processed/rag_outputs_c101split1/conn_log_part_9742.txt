Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP, 54.249.88.129, sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps clustered around 1641013235). ICMP type 8 is the standard ping request, and the rapid, repeated sending to many targets is consistent with a ping flood pattern, which aims to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.249.88.129  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range (e.g., 163.45.165.100, 163.45.12.214, 163.45.138.49, etc.)  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable (ICMP type 8).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.249.88.129 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP floods or other suspicious activity from this or related IPs.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., traffic shaping, anomaly-based IDS signatures).  
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, especially from external sources.
