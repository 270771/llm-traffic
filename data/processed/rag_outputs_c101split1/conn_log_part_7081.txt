Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 1, 3, 5, or 10, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm the target with echo requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 1 (Host Unreachable), and 5 (Redirect) are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of the ICMP traffic with types 1, 3, and 5 to ensure they are legitimate network control messages and not part of reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would warrant further investigation for ping floods.
