Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connections with SYN packets (S0 state) and no ICMP traffic entries. Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, there is no evidence of ping flood activity. All connections are TCP with various destination ports, none related to ICMP.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition. The TCP SYN attempts could indicate scanning or connection attempts but do not match ping flood patterns.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for possible SYN scan or other reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if available. Monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same IPs and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious sources.
