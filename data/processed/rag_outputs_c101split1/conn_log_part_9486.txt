Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the source IP (133.227.136.90) to the destination IP (54.198.197.73). A ping flood attack typically involves a large number of ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which may indicate an incomplete or unusual connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this or other sources. Collect additional logs to identify potential patterns of flooding or other ICMP-based attacks.
