Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field is `tcp`), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 flag), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts without completion would fall under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as absence here does not guarantee no ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
