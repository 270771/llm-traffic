Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic (type 11) may be related to network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.250.216.227 and destination IP 167.46.181.109 for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
