Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- All connections have protocol values 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP), and no ICMP protocol (1) entries are visible.  
- Without ICMP Echo Requests, the traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any hidden or unlogged ICMP flood attempts.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN failures (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance but not ping flooding.
