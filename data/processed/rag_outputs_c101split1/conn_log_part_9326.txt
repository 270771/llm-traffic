Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts and UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential scanning or SIP-related attacks. Collect ICMP logs or enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
