Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network captures to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for other suspicious patterns such as SYN floods or port scans, which may be indicated by the many S0 TCP states here.
