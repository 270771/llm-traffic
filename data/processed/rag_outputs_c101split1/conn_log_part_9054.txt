Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single entry with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ping floods require multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from one or more sources targeting a victim.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The first record (type 3) could be normal network behavior or a benign error message.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing issues.
