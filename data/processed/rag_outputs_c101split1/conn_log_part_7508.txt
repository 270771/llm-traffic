Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly indicated as type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests flooding the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the connection state "OTH" (other) and flags "F F" indicate these are likely isolated or non-standard ICMP connections, not a flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type details in more granular logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review network baseline to identify if these ICMP flows are normal or part of another reconnaissance or scanning activity.
