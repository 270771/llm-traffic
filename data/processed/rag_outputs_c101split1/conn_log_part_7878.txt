Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections targeting a single destination IP (18.46.170.245) from multiple distinct source IPs within the same timestamp.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), the exact type used in ping flood attacks.
- The volume and distribution of these ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target strongly match a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 18.46.170.245 (ICMP type 8, no ports applicable for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple from the 133.227.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.227.208.7, 133.227.136.125, 133.227.208.1, etc.)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.46.170.245.
2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in generating excessive ICMP traffic.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
5. Ensure the target host has appropriate ICMP flood protection enabled (e.g., ICMP rate limiting, firewall rules).
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any compromised hosts within the 133.227.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
