Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.110 and 133.105.230.109). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no retransmissions or anomalies.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without a pattern of repeated, high-rate ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this or other sources.  
- Investigate if these isolated pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.  
- If a sudden surge in ICMP Echo Requests occurs, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify under DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy.
