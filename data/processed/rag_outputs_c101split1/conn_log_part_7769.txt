Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume shown is minimal (only single packets per connection) and the state is OTH (other), indicating no established or continuous flow typical of a flood. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one source to multiple destinations or vice versa, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the low volume and lack of repeated traffic, this does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate the OTH state connections to understand why these ICMP packets are not completing typical flows.
