Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates error messages rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior. Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 3 traffic is normal network error reporting, not an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 3 messages could be useful to detect network issues or other ICMP-based attacks.
