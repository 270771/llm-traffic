Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are control messages unrelated to ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or other non-DoS related events that could be investigated further.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out misconfigurations or routing problems.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
