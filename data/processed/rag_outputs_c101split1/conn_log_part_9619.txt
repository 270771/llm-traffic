Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal TCP/UDP connection attempts, some with SYN failures (S0), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154, as multiple entries show UDP with flags S0 and D, which could indicate SIP scanning or malformed traffic.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- If ICMP traffic appears, verify ICMP type to confirm ping flood presence.
