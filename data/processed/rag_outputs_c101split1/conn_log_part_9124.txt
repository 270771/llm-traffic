Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from 49.47.247.214 to 163.45.128.77, but it shows a single connection with 48 bytes and no indication of rapid or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign specific labels. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns such as high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency or volume from the same source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or other DoS attacks.
