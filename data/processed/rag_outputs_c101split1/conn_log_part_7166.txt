Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (field 4) with a value of 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic context, the default interpretation is that this is normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.225.196 and destination IP 101.47.172.64 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages, but no immediate attack response is required.
