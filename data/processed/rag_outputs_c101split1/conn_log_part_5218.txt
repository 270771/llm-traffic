Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood is occurring.
