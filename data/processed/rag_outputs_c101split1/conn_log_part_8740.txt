Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP error messages that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
