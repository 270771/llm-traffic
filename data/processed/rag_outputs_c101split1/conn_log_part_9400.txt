Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections targeting a single destination IP (3.39.157.141) within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The volume and concurrency of these echo requests from multiple distinct source IPs (all in the 157.206.x.x range) strongly indicate a distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior matches the classic heuristic for ICMP flood detection: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single host.  
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High-volume ICMP Echo Request flood**.  
- The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.39.157.141 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.246.249, 157.206.157.32, 157.206.51.145, 157.206.252.158, 157.206.8.203, 157.206.20.245, 157.206.20.244, 157.206.169.9, 157.206.40.146, 157.206.205.155, 157.206.88.9, 157.206.143.126, 157.206.143.29, 157.206.18.119, 157.206.247.190, 157.206.18.123, 157.206.116.160, 157.206.127.221, 157.206.254.190, 157.206.122.12, 157.206.3.5, 157.206.109.160, 157.206.72.142  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.39.157.141.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
