Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 10, which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood. Additionally, the volume and frequency of ICMP echo requests in the snippet are minimal (only one echo request recorded), which does not match the high-rate, repetitive pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sustained high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.215.16.77 and 5.131.34.101) for any other suspicious activity if more data becomes available.  
- Confirm if ICMP types other than 8 are part of a different attack vector or benign traffic.
