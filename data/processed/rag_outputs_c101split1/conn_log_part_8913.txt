Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic likely represents traceroute or TTL-expired messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any surge in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. Investigate if these ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network issues or scanning activity, but no immediate threat is indicated.
