Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 11 packets is unusually high, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 floods or other suspicious traffic patterns.
