Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using tools or logs that record ICMP type and code fields, to detect any potential ping flood activity. Also, monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity in TCP traffic, as the logs show many SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance.
