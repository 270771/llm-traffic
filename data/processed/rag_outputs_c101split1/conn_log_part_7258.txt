Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if additional logs contain ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from a single source to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that could indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service activities.
