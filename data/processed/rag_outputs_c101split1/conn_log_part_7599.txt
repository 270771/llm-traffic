Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 8, 11, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.232, but there is only a single such record, not a flood or high volume of echo requests. The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP echo request flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP to a destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if repeated echo requests increase significantly.  
- Review network baseline traffic to identify abnormal ICMP patterns.
