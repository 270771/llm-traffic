Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), and no suspicious flags or counts indicate flooding.

No immediate attack is present. However, further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 145.66.225.255 to detect potential future ping floods.
