Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Further investigation should focus on monitoring ICMP traffic explicitly to detect ping floods. Enable or review ICMP-specific logs and verify if any ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in other data sources. Additionally, analyze the high volume of SYN attempts for potential scanning or other reconnaissance activities.
