Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged here, no ping flood can be detected. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is matched.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs specifically (icmp.log or equivalent) to check for ICMP Echo Requests if ping flood suspicion remains.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or UDP floods since many TCP SYN attempts with flags S0 (SYN sent, no response) are visible, which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood detection if further data becomes available.
