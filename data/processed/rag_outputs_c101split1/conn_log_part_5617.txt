Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (SYN sent, no response) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or firewall logs to confirm scanning behavior and identify possible sources for blocking or further monitoring.
