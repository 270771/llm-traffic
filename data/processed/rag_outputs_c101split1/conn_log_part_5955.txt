Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 163.45.190.221 to destination 39.123.87.124, with a single connection record showing 224 bytes transferred over 3 seconds. This does not indicate a flood pattern, which would require a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from any IP. If volume spikes, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review other ICMP types (e.g., type 3 - Destination Unreachable) for possible network issues or other attack types.
