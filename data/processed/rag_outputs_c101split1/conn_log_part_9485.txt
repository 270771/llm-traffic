Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.198.197.73 from different source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / DoS Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Sources - 133.227.211.11, 133.227.157.109, 157.206.201.249, 133.227.63.146, 133.227.181.253; Destination - 54.198.197.73; Port is not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.198.197.73.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
