Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port, here showing "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other control message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 traffic between 163.45.185.21 and 183.112.228.252 to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or control activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
