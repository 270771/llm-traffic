Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- All connections show TCP flags and ports, with no indication of ICMP packets or flooding behavior.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, and no anomalies are detected, no related heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- If ICMP traffic were present, heuristic #1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Network DoS" would be relevant.

Next Steps:
- Investigate network monitoring tools or logs that capture ICMP traffic explicitly.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for unusual ICMP packet rates or patterns in future logs.
