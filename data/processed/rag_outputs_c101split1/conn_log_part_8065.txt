Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have a type field value of 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known ping flood pattern.

No anomalies were detected in the provided anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent legitimate traffic or another form of ICMP-based activity. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual traffic volume from these IPs is recommended.
