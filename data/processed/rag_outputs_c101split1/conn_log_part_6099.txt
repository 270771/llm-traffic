Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 11, 8, and 3 respectively.  
- Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, there is exactly one ICMP type 8 record: from 220.254.134.232 to 163.45.116.98.  
- However, a single ICMP Echo Request does not constitute a ping flood. A ping flood involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, which is not evident here.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. If heuristics were available, this single ICMP Echo Request would not trigger a ping flood heuristic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 220.254.134.232 is generating multiple ICMP Echo Requests over time.  
- Check for other signs of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.

No current attack is detected based on the provided data.
