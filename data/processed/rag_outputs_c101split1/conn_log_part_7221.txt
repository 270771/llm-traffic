Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily malicious.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs to rule out ping floods. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving this IP pair.
