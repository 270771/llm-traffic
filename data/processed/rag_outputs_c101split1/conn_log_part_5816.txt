Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the packet counts and durations do not indicate an overwhelming volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood attack. For example, the largest packet count is 224 packets over nearly a second, which is not sufficient to confirm flooding. Additionally, some ICMP entries have types other than 8 (e.g., type 3), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting excessive ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame from a single source to a target.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sudden spike in ICMP Echo Requests from any single IP address.  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated ICMP type 8 traffic (e.g., 203.78.143.78, 185.183.48.120) for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable rate limiting or alerting on ICMP traffic volume to detect future flooding attempts.
