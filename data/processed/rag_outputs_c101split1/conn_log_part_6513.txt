Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are normal ICMP control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues, but no immediate attack response is required.
