Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate an ongoing ping flood attack. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

Since no anomalies are detected and the traffic does not match ping flood criteria, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 202.101.171.199 to the destination 66.104.113.92 is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
