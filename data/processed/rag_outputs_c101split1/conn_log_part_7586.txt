Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.245 with ICMP type 8, which is an Echo Request (ping). The second entry shows ICMP type 3, which is a Destination Unreachable message, not related to ping floods. However, there is only a single ICMP Echo Request recorded, not a high volume or rapid succession of such packets indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but the key criterion for ping flood detection is multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from one source to a destination, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 message for possible network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
