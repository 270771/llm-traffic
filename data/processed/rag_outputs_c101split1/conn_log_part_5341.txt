Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate a ping flood. All connections are either TCP or UDP, with no evidence of ICMP traffic at all.

Since no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack can be detected. The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps: Investigate network captures or logs that specifically include ICMP traffic to confirm if any ping flood attempts occur outside this dataset. Also, monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests in future logs.
