Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 194.186.13.133 to 133.251.70.224, but it shows only a single packet (count=1) and no signs of flooding such as high packet volume or repeated requests in a short time frame. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP in a short time window to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection logs.  
- If other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns appear, analyze accordingly with available heuristics.
