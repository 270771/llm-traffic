Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be a series of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (SYN sent, no response) as this may indicate a port scan or reconnaissance heuristic (commonly heuristic #1: "Port Scan" and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance").  
- Enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on these TCP connection attempts.
