Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has an ICMP type of 0, and the second has an ICMP type of 8. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic can be considered for ping flood detection. However, the volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a floodâ€”there are only two isolated ICMP connections with no indication of rapid or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if any other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.
