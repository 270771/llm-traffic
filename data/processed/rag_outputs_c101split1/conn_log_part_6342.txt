Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 0, and 13. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type used in ping floods.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request. These do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).  
- The traffic does not show repeated or excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp Request) messages to ensure they are not part of other reconnaissance or misconfiguration issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in future logs to detect potential ping flood attempts.
