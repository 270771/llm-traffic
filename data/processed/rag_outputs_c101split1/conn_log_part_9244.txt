Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 151.235.250.252 to destination 203.78.128.250 with 224 bytes sent once (not a flood). The other entries are ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of repeated ICMP type 8 packets or high volume traffic indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for possible network issues or other anomalies.  
- Collect more detailed traffic volume metrics to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP attacks.
