Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only entry with type 8 is from source IP 23.151.159.114 to destination 133.251.114.16, but it shows only a single packet (30 bytes) with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 23.151.159.114 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to confirm no flooding occurs.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Since ICMP type 3 and 11 are present, verify if there are network misconfigurations or routing issues causing these messages.  

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack.
