Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (54.209.24.157) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages (ping). The rapid succession of these requests from different source IPs (133.227.201.7, 133.227.72.130, 133.227.134.81, 133.227.139.189, 133.227.139.2) to a single target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, assign the heuristic as **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**.  
- Taxonomy class: **T1: Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.209.24.157 (no port for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: 133.227.201.7, 133.227.72.130, 133.227.134.81, 133.227.139.189, 133.227.139.2

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.209.24.157.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and prepare to escalate to incident response if service degradation occurs.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP traffic anomaly detection tools to identify and alert on similar future attacks.
