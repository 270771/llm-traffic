Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-", and no explicit ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is indicated. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were detected in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state "OTH" (other) and flags do not indicate a typical flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and rates. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP (2600:d3fc:7b45:fd:9e:802f:f714:fb42) to the destination IP (2001:fcff:fa79:c0fd:e:7ff:fe1e:3a07) to rule out stealthy or low-rate ICMP-based attacks.
