Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 112.161.194.98 to 133.251.85.98, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, since no excessive or repeated ICMP type 8 traffic is observed, this does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which typically involves a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
