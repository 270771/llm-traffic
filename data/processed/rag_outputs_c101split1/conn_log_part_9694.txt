Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are either TCP or UDP connections; none show ICMP traffic.
- The protocol field is either "tcp" or "udp" with no indication of ICMP packets.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The absence of ICMP entries means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts without completion fall under reconnaissance heuristics (commonly heuristic #1) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance/Scanning."

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs on port 5060 (SIP signaling port) as it may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for potential scanning or DoS attempts on UDP port 5060.
