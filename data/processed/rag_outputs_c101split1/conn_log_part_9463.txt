Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "3" for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this is normal ICMP error message traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP error messages that could indicate network issues or other attack types. Further investigation could include checking for ICMP type 8 floods or other anomalies in related logs.
