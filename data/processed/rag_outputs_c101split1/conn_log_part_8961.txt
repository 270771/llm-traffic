Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN or RST flags, some UDP traffic, but no signs of ICMP flooding.

Since no anomaly CSV or heuristic context is provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be explicitly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping floods.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies if available.
