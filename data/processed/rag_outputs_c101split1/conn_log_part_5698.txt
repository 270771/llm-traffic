Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate why the host 157.206.59.172 is sending ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to 167.246.129.100, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues unrelated to ping floods. Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect any future ping flood attempts.
