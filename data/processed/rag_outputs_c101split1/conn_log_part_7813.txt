Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 8 (from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.40), but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target.

Next steps:  
Monitor for a high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic on network devices.
