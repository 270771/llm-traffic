Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other) and the flags indicate no retransmissions or unusual packet counts (all zeroes in packet/byte fields). There is no evidence of high volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found to support suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 8 is present but no flooding pattern is observed, this traffic appears to be normal ping probes or scans rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for broader context.
