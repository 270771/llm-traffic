Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, the only ICMP type 8 entries are from source IP 172.23.68.231 to two different destinations (163.45.69.121 and 163.45.148.110), but these are isolated single entries without volume or frequency indicative of flooding.  
- Other ICMP types present (11, 3) correspond to Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable messages, which are not ping requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP echo requests (type 8) rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to confirm no slow or low-rate ICMP scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request frequency or volume that might indicate emerging ping flood behavior.
