Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard taxonomy, these ICMP types are not indicative of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
