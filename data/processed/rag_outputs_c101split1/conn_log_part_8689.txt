Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (last field before the count is 0), not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping flood traffic, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet count is very low (1), which does not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other ICMP type 8 entries with high frequency or volume to confirm or rule out ping flood. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 216.175.14.249.
