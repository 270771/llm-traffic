Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.17.177.6, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013236.6xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically classified under a Denial of Service (DoS) attack taxonomy. Assigning heuristic number 1 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" is appropriate here.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 3.17.177.6 (ICMP type 8, no ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.11.50, 133.243.216.6, 133.243.135.180, 133.243.32.96, 133.243.248.254, etc.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.17.177.6.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if ICMP is not required for operational purposes.
