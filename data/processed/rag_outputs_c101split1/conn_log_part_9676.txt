Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but the log shows only two isolated ICMP packets from different source IPs (157.206.20.243 and 157.206.20.245) to the same destination (52.223.127.239). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet counts are minimal (1 each), which does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by a large number of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Additionally, investigate why these isolated ICMP packets are presentâ€”could be benign network scanning or misconfiguration.
