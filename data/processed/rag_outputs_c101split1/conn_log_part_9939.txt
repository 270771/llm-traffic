Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) to overwhelm the target. Since the traffic here is echo replies, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an atypical or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 and destination IP 95.89.125.254 for unusual ICMP traffic volume or other suspicious activity over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.
