Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping) packets.
- These packets are all targeting the same destination IP address: 34.17.112.111.
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.
- The rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to a single target matches the known pattern of a ping flood, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: ICMP Flood Detection** (common in network security for detecting volumetric ICMP attacks).
- The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**, specifically an ICMP-based DoS.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 34.17.112.111 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.241.238, 133.243.182.205, 133.243.85.19, 133.243.224.97, 133.243.169.121, etc.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 34.17.112.111.
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or follow-up attacks.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if ICMP is not required for operational purposes.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts among the source IPs and remediate accordingly.
