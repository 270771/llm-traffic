Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. The traffic appears to be a series of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force behavior. Collect ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP-based attacks occur. Establish heuristics for detecting TCP scanning if not already in place.
