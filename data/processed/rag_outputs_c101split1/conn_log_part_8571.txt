Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0, 11, and 129, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 129 (ICMPv6 Echo Reply) traffic to ensure they are legitimate and not part of other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
