Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 4th column after the source IP) is 11 and 8 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, one entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not a ping flood indicator. The other entry has type 8 but only a single packet is logged, not a flood or high volume of echo requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 packets for possible traceroute or network issues, as they may indicate other network conditions but not an attack.
