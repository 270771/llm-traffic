Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.
- The traffic shows multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN sent but no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.
- Without heuristic context, the likely heuristic for scanning would be connection attempts with no response (S0), and taxonomy class would be "Reconnaissance/Scanning."

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0) for potential port scanning or probing.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for suspicious patterns from the IPs listed.
