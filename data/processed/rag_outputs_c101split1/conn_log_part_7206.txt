Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and echo reply (type 0), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity or different attack types, such as ICMP error message floods or reconnaissance, but no immediate ping flood response is required.
