Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (echo request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the number of packets and duration (9.899874 seconds for 6400 bytes) do not clearly indicate a flood pattern without additional frequency or volume context. The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is not type 8 and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to support suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of excessive ICMP echo requests or rapid repeated pings from the same source, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from single IPs over short intervals.  
- Investigate if the 6400 bytes over ~10 seconds from 111.151.57.133 to 203.78.141.247 represent a normal ping or a potential slow ICMP scan.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify unusual ICMP patterns.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack.
