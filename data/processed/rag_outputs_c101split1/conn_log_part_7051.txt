Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Since ICMP type 13 is used for time synchronization queries, this traffic may be benign or part of network diagnostics.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and context.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (131.140.172.72) to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 13 traffic volume is abnormally high or correlated with other suspicious activity.
