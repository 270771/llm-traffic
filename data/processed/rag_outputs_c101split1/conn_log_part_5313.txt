Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to ensure ping floods are not missed.
