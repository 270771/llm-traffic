Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `8`. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood traffic. Here, only one entry has type 8, but it is a single connection with no evidence of flooding (no high volume or repeated rapid requests). The other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy, ICMP type 11 is related to network diagnostics or traceroute, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 58.142.235.227 sending ICMP Echo Requests to 133.105.191.22 for any unusual volume or frequency over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.  
- If high volume ICMP Echo Requests are observed, apply heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" for further action.
