Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed traffic aligns with typical port scanning or connection attempts rather than flooding.
- The S0 state in Zeek conn.log typically corresponds to connection attempts without response, often linked to reconnaissance.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.146, 185.138.73.88) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection patterns.
