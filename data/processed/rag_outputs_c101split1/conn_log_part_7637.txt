Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.213, which is an echo request (ping).  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 from 133.243.206.29 to 23.197.213.7, which is an echo reply, not a request.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The log snippet contains only two ICMP packets with no indication of flooding or abnormal volume.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination at high frequency.  
- Investigate if any other logs show increased ICMP traffic volume or other suspicious patterns.  
- If ICMP traffic spikes, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (e.g., heuristic #1: excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" for further analysis.
