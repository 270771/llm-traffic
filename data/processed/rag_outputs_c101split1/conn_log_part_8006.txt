Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 111.24.92.249. However, this single entry with a low packet count (32 bytes, 0.029588 seconds duration) does not indicate a flood pattern. The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. Given the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Also, investigate the purpose of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) messages if they increase significantly, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
