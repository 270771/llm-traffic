Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting two destination IPs: 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26. Multiple distinct source IPs from the 157.206.x.x range are sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously within the same second (timestamp 1641013232.99xxxx), indicating a high volume of ping requests aimed at overwhelming the targets.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: many ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly from multiple sources to one or more targets, aiming to saturate network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristics are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in 157.206.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.206.40.144, 157.206.72.168, 157.206.122.43, etc.)
  - Destinations: 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.206.0.0/16).
2. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor the affected hosts (54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) for service degradation or outages.
5. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing and apply network segmentation or access controls as needed.
