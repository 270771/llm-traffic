Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has ICMP type 128 (indicated by the Zeek conn.log ICMP code field), which corresponds to an ICMPv6 Echo Request, not the ICMP type 8 used in IPv4 ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for an ICMP ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no retransmissions or errors.

No other attack patterns are evident from this snippet. However, since this is ICMPv6 Echo Request traffic, it is normal network behavior unless seen in high volume or unusual patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for unusually high rates of ICMPv6 Echo Requests from these IPs (2001:fa13:fc7d:4106:fcf1:f:525d:4eaf and 2001:fcff:fa79:c0fd:e:7ff:fe1e:3a07). If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ICMPv6-based DoS or reconnaissance activity.
