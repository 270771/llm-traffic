Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, primarily on port 5060 (SIP signaling) and various TCP ports.
- There is no indication of ICMP traffic in the log snippet, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 is consistent with SIP signaling attempts or scanning, not ICMP ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, the heuristic for ping flood detection (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The taxonomy class for ping flood would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP-based attacks, but this is not relevant here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or a different type of DoS or reconnaissance.
- Collect and analyze ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm the absence of ping flood activity.
- Enable or review anomaly detection rules for UDP floods or SIP-related attacks.
