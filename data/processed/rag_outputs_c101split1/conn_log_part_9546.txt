Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1, which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns that involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual connection state but is not sufficient to classify this as a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 messages between 163.45.185.89 and 43.178.206.161 to determine if there are network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
