Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, and no such data is shown.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, not ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The S0 state typically corresponds to incomplete TCP handshakes, often related to scanning or reconnaissance, not flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated S0 states for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze ICMP traffic specifically.
- Monitor for any sudden surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.
