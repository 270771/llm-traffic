Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 8, 11, or 128, but none have ICMP type 8 as the majority or repeated rapidly from a single source to a single destination. Specifically, the ICMP type field (the 4th and 11th columns) shows values like 8, 11, and 128, but the counts of packets per connection are very low (mostly 0 or 1). There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets flooding a target, which is required to classify this as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of repeated ICMP Echo Requests and low packet counts strongly indicate no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and 128 (Echo Reply) packets for potential traceroute or diagnostic activity, which is normal but could be part of reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IP to any destination IP, which would warrant re-evaluation for ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic volume thresholds to detect future flooding attempts.
