Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics and taxonomy classes related to scanning.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.134, 89.247.66.138) for potential scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP traffic anomalies.
