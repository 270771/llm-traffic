Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have types 3 and 0, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 0 indicates Echo Reply, which are normal control messages or responses, not flooding attempts.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, so no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. Given the lack of suspicious ICMP Echo Requests and no anomaly records, no attack is present.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated Echo Requests from the same source IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood. Also, review other logs for potential related anomalies.
