Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" and low packet count further support normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

No ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here. Further investigation could focus on monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 3.241.1.60 if suspicious activity arises.
