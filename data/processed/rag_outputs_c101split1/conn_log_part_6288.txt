Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the log entries are mostly 3, 10, and 0, with only two entries showing type 8 (echo request). However, these type 8 entries are isolated and do not show the high volume or rapid repetition characteristic of a ping flood attack. Additionally, the absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents linking these entries to known ping flood heuristics.

The ICMP types observed:
- Type 8 (Echo Request): Present but sparse, not indicative of flooding.
- Types 3 and 10: These correspond to Destination Unreachable and Router Advertisement messages, which are unrelated to ping floods.

No heuristic or taxonomy data is available, but typically:
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service" or "Flooding Attack."

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets (143.187.187.164 and 143.187.187.183) for any unusual activity or volume over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests that could indicate an emerging ping flood.
