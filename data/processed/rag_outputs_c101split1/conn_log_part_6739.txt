Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are control messages rather than echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed ICMP types suggest normal network control or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic volume that could indicate a developing ping flood.
