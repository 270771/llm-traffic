Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no explicit ICMP type 8), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP Echo Replies and requests from these IPs to rule out other ICMP-based anomalies or reconnaissance activities. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from 195.157.244.2 to 203.78.143.78 would be necessary to detect a potential ping flood.
