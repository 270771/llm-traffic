Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic mostly consists of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN connection attempts (S0 state) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or filtering to capture any future ICMP Echo Requests for more accurate detection of ping floods.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if such context becomes available.
