Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here "icmp" protocol with no explicit type 8), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other control message, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 traffic between 133.105.128.252 and 89.247.66.53 for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based activity, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
