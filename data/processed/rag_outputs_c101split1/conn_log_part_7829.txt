Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record (151.105.96.5 â†’ 133.105.230.31) with a count of 0 packets and 0 bytes transferred, indicating no flood or high volume of echo requests. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or other anomalies unrelated to ping floods.
