Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 163.45.129.28 to 13.252.225.107 with ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), this does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic from 112.62.255.33 to 203.78.134.246 with ICMP type 8, which is an Echo Request, but the duration is very long (22.9 seconds) with equal bytes sent and received (336), indicating a single or low-rate ping rather than a flood. There is no evidence of high packet rate or volume typical of a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the long-duration ICMP session from 112.62.255.33 for possible network issues or benign prolonged ping tests.
