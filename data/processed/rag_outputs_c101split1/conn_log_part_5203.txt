Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the condition for a ping flood is not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.66.138 on port 8080) for possible scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for comprehensive threat detection.
