Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the port field "3" and "1"â€”the exact ICMP type is 1, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be a single ICMP message of type 1, which is normal network behavior for error reporting, not an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is required. However, if there is concern about ICMP error messages, monitoring for unusual volumes or repeated ICMP type 1 messages could be a next step.
