Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show two ICMP connections. The first entry from 202.250.230.253 to 184.145.138.163 has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an Echo Request (type 8). The second entry from 207.3.184.197 to 203.78.135.92 has ICMP type 6, which is neither Echo Request (8) nor Echo Reply (0). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions:

- ICMP type 8 = Echo Request (used in ping floods)  
- ICMP type 11 = Time Exceeded (used in traceroute or TTL expiry)  
- ICMP type 6 = Unassigned or experimental (not standard Echo Request)

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IP 202.250.230.253 sending ICMP type 11 messages, as excessive Time Exceeded messages can indicate network scanning or routing issues. Also, verify the nature of ICMP type 6 traffic from 207.3.184.197, as it is unusual and may warrant further packet capture and analysis.

No immediate security response for ping flood is required.
