Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. There are no ICMP records or anomalies related to ICMP traffic in the provided data. The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is present.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. However, the traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or firewall alerts to confirm if these represent a different attack vector. Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes separately to detect future ping flood attempts.
