Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 128.149.158.11 to destination 163.45.196.8, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 10, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior or classify these as attacks.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume from 128.149.158.11 could be a prudent next step to detect any escalation.
