Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.46.170.245) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for volumetric ICMP flood attacks and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Layer."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources from the 133.227.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.227.225.150, 133.227.58.122, 133.227.204.1, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.46.170.245 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (18.46.170.245) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential sources of ICMP floods.
  4. Engage incident response to trace back and contain compromised hosts within the 133.227.x.x subnet.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
