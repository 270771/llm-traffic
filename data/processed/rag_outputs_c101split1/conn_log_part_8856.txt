Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field indicated as "11" (likely Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 11 messages is unusually high, which could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect heuristic data and anomaly taxonomy definitions to improve detection accuracy.
