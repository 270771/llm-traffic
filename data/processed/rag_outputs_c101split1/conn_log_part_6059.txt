Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 128.149.158.11 to destination 163.45.159.54, but there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern by correlating with additional logs or network flow data.
