Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this is not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, SYN scan heuristics relate to reconnaissance, not flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.
