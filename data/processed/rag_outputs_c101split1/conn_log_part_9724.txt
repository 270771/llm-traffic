Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP connections in the log have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). The ICMP types observed include 3 (Destination Unreachable), 10 (Router Advertisement), and 13 (Timestamp), none of which correspond to the ICMP Echo Request type 8 required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which specifically involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as these could indicate network scanning, misconfiguration, or other network issues. Monitoring for unusual ICMP type 3 patterns or other ICMP types may help identify other potential network anomalies or attacks.
