Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type values 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping flood detection. However, the entries from IP 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.188 and 133.105.230.189 show single ICMP Echo Requests, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of flooding. The other entry with ICMP type 3 is a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics look for sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to one or multiple targets.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these ICMP Echo Requests are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
