Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, and no such data is visible here.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), indicating scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The S0 state in Zeek conn.log typically indicates incomplete TCP handshakes, often related to scanning or reconnaissance, not flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154, which may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.
