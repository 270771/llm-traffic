Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood (ICMP Echo Request flood) by definition.

Next steps:
- Investigate why no ICMP traffic is loggedâ€”verify if ICMP logging is enabled and functioning.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 state (connection attempts without completion) are present, which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.
