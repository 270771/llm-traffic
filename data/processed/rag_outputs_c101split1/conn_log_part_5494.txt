Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) with no successful handshakes, indicating scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity (TCP SYN scans), which typically falls under heuristic classes related to network scanning or probing.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0 state) for potential scanning or reconnaissance.
- Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or firewall logs to confirm if these IPs are performing suspicious scanning.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts.
