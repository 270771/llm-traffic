Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 3 messages are being generated between 163.45.185.89 and 213.97.107.192, as this may indicate network misconfiguration or other issues unrelated to ping floods. Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect ping floods.
