Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no indication of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages (203.78.140.235) to ensure no misconfigurations or network issues causing unreachable destinations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Implement baseline traffic analysis to detect sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.
