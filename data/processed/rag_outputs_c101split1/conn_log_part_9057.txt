Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.143.78 to 71.34.199.6 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not type 8 and therefore not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic is triggered here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination at a high rate, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 if it begins sending multiple echo requests rapidly.  
- Continue logging and correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service conditions.
