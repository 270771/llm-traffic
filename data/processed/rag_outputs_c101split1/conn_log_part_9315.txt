Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 100.84.99.85 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013232.76). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Since no explicit anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests to a single target**. The taxonomy class is **"ICMP Flooding"**, a common category for denial-of-service attacks using ICMP Echo Requests.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 100.84.99.85 (ICMP type 8, port 0)  
- Source IPs: 133.227.212.249, 133.227.183.249, 133.227.135.106, 133.227.159.250, 133.227.63.146, 133.227.206.249, 133.227.96.141  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the log shows port 0 as expected.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Monitor the target host 100.84.99.85 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.  
3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger distributed attack.  
4. Engage with upstream ISP or network provider to trace and mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS/IPS signatures tuned for ICMP floods.  
6. Document and report the incident for future reference and to improve detection heuristics.
