Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `1`, which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 1 messages are being generated between 133.227.157.48 and 185.167.249.223, as frequent Destination Unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
