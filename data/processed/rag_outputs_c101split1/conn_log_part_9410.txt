Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (69.232.167.29) sending multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to many different destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood or ICMP flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from one source to multiple destinations" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 69.232.167.29; targets include 163.45.91.62, 163.45.14.128, 163.45.120.75, 163.45.19.76, 163.45.127.89, 163.45.94.173, 163.45.109.5, 163.45.74.165, 163.45.91.242, 163.45.190.99.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms Echo Request packets.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 69.232.167.29 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this and related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent service degradation.
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches internal networks.
