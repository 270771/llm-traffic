Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

- ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," which is typically a response message, not an attack.
- ICMP type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)," also a response or error message.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions:

- Heuristic: No ping flood heuristic triggered (would require ICMP type 8).
- Taxonomy: No ping flood class applicable.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 1 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations, routing issues, or other connectivity problems rather than an attack. Monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 3 or 1 messages could indicate network instability or scanning activity, which may warrant further analysis.
