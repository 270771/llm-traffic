Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping traffic relevant to a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only a few entries have ICMP type 8, but they do not show a high volume or rapid succession from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding.  
- For example, the entry at timestamp 1641013207.920010 shows ICMP type 8 from 133.243.75.79 to 218.48.91.102, but there is only one such record with no evidence of repeated or sustained traffic.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 11) are present, which are not related to ping floods.  
- The entry at 1641013206.926798 shows ICMP type 8 with a high packet count (224), but it is a single record and does not confirm flooding without multiple repeated connections or sustained traffic over time.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to assign specific heuristic numbers or taxonomy classes. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.  
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service" or "ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs over a short time window to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate the source IP 62.174.42.249 with 224 packets sent in one connection for possible scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable alerting on abnormal ICMP traffic volume or rate thresholds.
