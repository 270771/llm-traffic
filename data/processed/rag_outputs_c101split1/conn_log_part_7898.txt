Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections, but only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only type relevant for ping floods. The other entries have types 13 (Timestamp Request) and 0 (Echo Reply), which do not indicate ping flood activity. Additionally, the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets here are very low (only single packets per connection), not matching the high-rate, repetitive ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. If this traffic were to be investigated further, focus should be on monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources targeting a victim IP, which would better indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Continue monitoring ICMP traffic for increased frequency of Echo Requests (type 8) and correlate with network performance degradation or alerts from IDS/IPS systems.
