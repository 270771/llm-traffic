Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that deviate from normal baseline behavior.
