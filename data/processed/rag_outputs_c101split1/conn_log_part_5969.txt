Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as its absence may indicate logging gaps.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN failures (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts worth further analysis.
