Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.227.159.48 and 203.78.140.213) for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect possible future ping floods.
