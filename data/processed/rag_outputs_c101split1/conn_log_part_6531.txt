Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ICMP-based attack heuristics apply here.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using packet capture tools or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies. Also, review connection attempts for possible scanning or reconnaissance activity.
