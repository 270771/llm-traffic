Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations." The taxonomy class is "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to monitor for collateral impact on targeted hosts.  
4. Consider blacklisting or quarantining the source IP if it is confirmed malicious and not part of legitimate network operations.  
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify any compromised hosts or vulnerabilities exploited to launch this attack.
