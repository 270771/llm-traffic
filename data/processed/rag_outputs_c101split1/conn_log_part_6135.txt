Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 0, 1, 3, and 11, none of which correspond to the ICMP Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages further, as these can indicate network scanning, misconfigurations, or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these ICMP messages are part of a broader reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempt.
