Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3` respectively, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network errors rather than attack traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions:

- Heuristic: No ping flood heuristic triggered (would require ICMP type 8).
- Taxonomy: No ping flood classification applies.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
