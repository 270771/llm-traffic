Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8, so it is not a ping flood.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns over a longer time window.
