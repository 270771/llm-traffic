Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8. Ping floods require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).  
- There is no evidence of repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from the snippet.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP traffic appears normal or related to standard network diagnostics/errors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.243.206.21 sending ICMP type 3 messages if unusual for the environment, as these indicate unreachable destinations.  
- Continue logging and correlate with other network data for comprehensive threat detection.
