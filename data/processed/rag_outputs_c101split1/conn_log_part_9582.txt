Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x subnet. The timestamps are nearly identical, indicating rapid-fire requests consistent with a ping flood.
- This matches the known ping flood pattern: a single attacker sending numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker - 54.254.197.94; Targets - multiple IPs in 163.45.0.0/16 subnet; ICMP type: 8 (echo request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.254.197.94 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or other hosts.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential compromised hosts communicating with 54.254.197.94.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in IDS/IPS systems.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise of the attacker host.
