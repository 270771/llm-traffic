Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but there is only a single connection record per source-destination pair with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The conn.log snippet shows only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests, not a flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of repeated or volumetric ICMP traffic, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a surge in ICMP Echo Requests is observed, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, consider correlating with network flow data or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP anomalies.
