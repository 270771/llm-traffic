Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN packets and no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed TCP SYN attempts could align with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically labeled as "Heuristic 1: Port Scanning" and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance."
- Further investigation should focus on the source IPs generating numerous SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.153) to determine if this is a scanning campaign.

Next Steps:
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to confirm the absence of ping flood activity.
- Monitor for repeated SYN attempts and correlate with IDS alerts for scanning or DoS attempts.
- Implement rate limiting or blocking for suspicious IPs if scanning is confirmed.
