Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan or connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the network for ICMP traffic separately to confirm no ping flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in packet captures or other logs.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
