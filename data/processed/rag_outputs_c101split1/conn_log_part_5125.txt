Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 flag), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further for potential TCP scanning or reconnaissance activity given the high number of SYN-only connections. Monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same IPs and correlate with IDS alerts or firewall logs to confirm scanning behavior. Establish heuristics for TCP SYN flood or scanning if not already in place.
