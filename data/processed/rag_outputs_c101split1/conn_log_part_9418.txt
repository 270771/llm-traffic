Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All observed ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type 17 (UDP) or TCP/UDP protocols; there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present in the Zeek conn.log snippet. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

The traffic shows multiple UDP connections from 45.121.95.154 to various 133.105.177.x hosts on port 5060 and related ports, which may indicate suspicious UDP activity but not a ping flood. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, this pattern could suggest a UDP-based scanning or SIP-related probing attack rather than ICMP flooding.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 targeting port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) for potential SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts.  
- Enable protocol-specific anomaly detection heuristics for UDP floods or SIP abuse.  
- Collect ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests occur outside this snippet.

Since no anomaly or heuristic data is available, no taxonomy or heuristic number can be assigned confidently at this time.
