Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly indicated as type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests flooding the target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review other logs or anomaly sources for signs of different attack vectors, as the current data does not indicate an attack.
