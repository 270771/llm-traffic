Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 1 and 3, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 1 is an ICMP destination unreachable message, and type 3 is a source quench or other control message, which are not indicative of ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP type 1 and 3 traffic may indicate network issues or other control messages but are not attacks by themselves.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns that could indicate a different type of ICMP-based attack.
