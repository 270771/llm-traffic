Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP records.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or use packet capture tools to detect potential ICMP floods.  
- Monitor for other attack types suggested by TCP flags (e.g., many S0 flags indicate SYN scan or connection attempts) but these are not ping floods.
