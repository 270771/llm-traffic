Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled in Zeek or other monitoring tools. Look for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
