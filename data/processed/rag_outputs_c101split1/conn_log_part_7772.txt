Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). The second entry has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not related to ping floods. However, there is only one ICMP Echo Request record, and no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a Denial of Service (DoS) attack taxonomy and detected by heuristics monitoring ICMP Echo Request volume and rate.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sustained high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 for unusual ICMP traffic patterns over a longer time window.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to identify any degradation consistent with DoS activity.
