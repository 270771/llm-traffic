Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.152.30 to destination 220.241.115.125, with a single packet and very low duration (0.000002 seconds).  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11, 13) are not related to ping floods as per the given rule.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP echo requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from any IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.152.30 if it sends multiple echo requests over time.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks (e.g., ICMP unreachable or redirect) if suspicious patterns emerge.
