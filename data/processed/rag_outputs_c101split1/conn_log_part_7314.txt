Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second ICMP entry has type 8 (Echo Request), but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic or flooding activity.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no excessive ICMP Echo Requests are observed, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP types that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
