Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 typically indicates network issues or unreachable hosts rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages between 133.227.159.37 and 134.210.54.103 to rule out network misconfigurations or routing problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
