Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would have protocol number 1, but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No entries indicate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks.
- The UDP entries present have no indication of ICMP or excessive echo requests.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The heuristic for ping flood would typically involve detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next Steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically, as conn.log may not fully capture ICMP details.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific Zeek logs (icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for unusual ICMP echo request rates or patterns in network traffic.
