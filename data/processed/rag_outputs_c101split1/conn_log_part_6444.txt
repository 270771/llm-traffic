Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows traffic from 221.71.240.198 to 203.78.143.78 with ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an Echo Request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry shows traffic from 82.145.252.180 to 203.78.135.92 with ICMP type 8, which is an Echo Request, but there is only a single packet with no indication of flooding or high volume.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target are evident, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 messages for possible network issues or traceroute activity, as they are not related to ping floods.
