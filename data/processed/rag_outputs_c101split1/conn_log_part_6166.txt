Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP records present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (connection attempts that did not complete). This could indicate a TCP SYN scan or other reconnaissance. Next steps include enabling detailed TCP flag analysis and correlating with IDS alerts for scanning heuristics. Monitoring for repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs could help identify potential attackers.
