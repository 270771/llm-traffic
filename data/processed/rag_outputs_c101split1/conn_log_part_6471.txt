Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 3, which indicates a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods. Since neither entry contains ICMP type 8, no ping flood pattern is present.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 messages could indicate network issues or scanning activity worth investigating further by reviewing network reachability and firewall logs.
