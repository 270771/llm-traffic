Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other issues, but they do not represent a ping flood. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
