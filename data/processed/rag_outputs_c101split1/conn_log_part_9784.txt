Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a single source IP (13.24.95.251) sending numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007–0.008 seconds per packet). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to multiple destinations in a short time. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 13.24.95.251
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.202.249, 163.45.22.136, 163.45.19.168, 163.45.40.216, 163.45.19.79, 163.45.116.249, 163.45.130.9, 163.45.183.53, 163.45.19.187, 163.45.183.8, 163.45.114.146, 163.45.183.55, 163.45.12.110, 163.45.188.171, 163.45.188.6, 163.45.114.68, 163.45.130.219, 163.45.130.184, 163.45.188.250, 163.45.191.43, 163.45.12.182, 163.45.12.214
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.24.95.251 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Consider blacklisting or applying geo-IP restrictions if the source IP is from an untrusted region.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the source IP is part of a botnet or compromised host.
