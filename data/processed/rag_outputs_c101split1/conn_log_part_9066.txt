Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs containing ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated unreachable messages that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
