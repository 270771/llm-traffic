Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0 or 11, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the records indicate type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded), this traffic may be related to diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.229.227 which is generating multiple ICMP type 0 and 11 messages in a short time frame. While not a ping flood, this could indicate network scanning, misconfiguration, or other ICMP-based reconnaissance. Monitoring for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns is recommended.
