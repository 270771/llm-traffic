Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.72.141.69) targeting multiple distinct destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messagesâ€”the exact type used in ping floods. This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #3: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 18.72.141.69  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.0.79, 163.45.0.113, 163.45.0.250, 163.45.13.191, 163.45.48.49, 163.45.48.123, 163.45.65.83, 163.45.65.89, 163.45.65.111, 163.45.68.73, 163.45.170.1, 163.45.170.10, 163.45.170.244, 163.45.176.253, 163.45.183.53, 163.45.203.253, 163.45.225.43, 163.45.168.25, 163.45.168.134  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.72.141.69 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for similar patterns from other sources to detect potential coordinated attacks.  
3. Implement ICMP rate limiting on critical network infrastructure to mitigate impact.  
4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and assess potential compromise.  
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
