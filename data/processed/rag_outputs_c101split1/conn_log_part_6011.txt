Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 3 traffic could indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently malicious without further context.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 178.0.172.171 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or a different reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
