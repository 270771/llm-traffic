Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (44.202.74.222) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping operations. The rapid succession of these packets from different source IPs (133.243.146.11, 133.243.98.105, 133.243.24.8) to the same target strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies).  
- The taxonomy class is "Network Denial of Service" (DoS) via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attackers: 133.243.146.11, 133.243.98.105, 133.243.24.8 (source IPs)  
- Victim: 44.202.74.222 (destination IP)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
- Monitor the victim IP (44.202.74.222) for service degradation or outages.  
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.  
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader attack vectors.
