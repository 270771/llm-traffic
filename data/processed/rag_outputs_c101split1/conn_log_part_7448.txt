Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 13 and 10, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 13 corresponds to Timestamp Request, and type 10 corresponds to Router Advertisement, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types are unusual in the environment, further investigation into potential reconnaissance or misconfiguration could be warranted.

Next steps:  
- Verify if the volume of ICMP type 10 and 13 traffic is abnormal for the network baseline.  
- Monitor for any unusual ICMP traffic patterns that could indicate other reconnaissance or network mapping activities.  
- Collect additional logs or alerts to correlate with these ICMP types for a broader threat assessment.
