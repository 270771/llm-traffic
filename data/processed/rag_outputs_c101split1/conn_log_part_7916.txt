Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic between 133.251.131.103 and 64.190.198.194, but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly stated as type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the required condition for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate alternative attack types.

Next steps: Verify the ICMP type field in the logs to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. If multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency are observed, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, monitor for other ICMP types that could indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service activities.
