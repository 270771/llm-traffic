Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily malicious.

Next steps: Investigate why the ICMP Echo Replies are logged without corresponding Echo Requests and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from 157.206.152.29 to 173.20.80.33, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.
