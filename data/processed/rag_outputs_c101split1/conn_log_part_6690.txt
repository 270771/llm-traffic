Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. All entries have protocols listed as tcp (6) or udp (17), and no ICMP protocol (1) records appear.

Since no ICMP Echo Requests are detected, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy information is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate network logs that include ICMP traffic explicitly to detect ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP patterns or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests. Further analysis of TCP SYN flood or scanning activity may be warranted given the many S0 states.
