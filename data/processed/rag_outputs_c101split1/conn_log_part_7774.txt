Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the field with value 0 after the destination port), which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Without evidence of ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns, no ping flood or related ICMP attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for other types of suspicious activity, especially if other ICMP types or unusual traffic volumes appear in extended logs. Monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in high volume remains critical for detecting ping floods.
