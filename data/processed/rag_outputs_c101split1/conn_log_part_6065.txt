Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.143.78 to 185.184.176.5 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such connection with a duration of 0.18 seconds and 32 bytes transferred, which does not indicate flooding or high-volume repetitive traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) from 219.188.255.8 to 203.78.143.78, which is unrelated to ping floods since the ICMP type is not 8.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume or sustained bursts from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 for any unusual ICMP activity if volume increases.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity, as single ICMP echo requests may be benign or part of network diagnostics.
