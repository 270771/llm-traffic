Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the ICMP type and connection state (OTH), this appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood, but monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) would be a prudent next step to detect potential future ping floods.
