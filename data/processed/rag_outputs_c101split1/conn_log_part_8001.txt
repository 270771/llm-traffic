Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 123.123.41.137 to 163.45.216.197, which is a valid ping request. However, there is only a single packet logged, not a flood or high volume of ICMP Echo Requests. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping flood attacks require a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple IPs to the same destination. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network traffic for other types of ICMP abuse or denial-of-service patterns.
