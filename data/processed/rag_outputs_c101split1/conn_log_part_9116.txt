Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 13 and 1. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood attack, but neither entry shows type 8.  
- Type 13 corresponds to Timestamp Request, and type 1 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic strongly rules out a ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.137.66 sending multiple Destination Unreachable messages (ICMP type 1) to 161.29.109.160, which may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
