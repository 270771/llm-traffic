Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (last field before the count is 0), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific alternative attack classification can be assigned. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, which may warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 203.78.143.78 and 103.29.251.5 to rule out other ICMP-based anomalies or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
