Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response, not an attack initiation. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type.

Since no anomalies are detected and the traffic does not match ping flood criteria, no immediate security action is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 65.157.249.45 to destination 203.78.143.78 is recommended to detect any future suspicious activity.
