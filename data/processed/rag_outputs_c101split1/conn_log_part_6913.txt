Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 4 and 1, respectively, not 8. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types (4 = Source Quench, 1 = Destination Unreachable) suggest other ICMP message types rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP messages to ensure they are legitimate network control messages and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or abnormal volume from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
