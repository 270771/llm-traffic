Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 indicates error messages rather than a flood or scan.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Destination Unreachable messages are being generated between 133.243.206.21 and 134.210.54.103, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or connectivity issues. Monitoring for increased volume or other ICMP types may be warranted.
