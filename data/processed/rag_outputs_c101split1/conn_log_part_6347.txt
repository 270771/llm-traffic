Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP entries are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state (connection attempts without response) as potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Monitor for repeated failed connection attempts from the same IPs and consider blocking or rate-limiting suspicious sources. Further analysis should include capturing ICMP traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts.
