Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 6th field after the source IP and port, which shows values 128, 3, 3, and 3. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood, but none of these entries have type 8. Instead, types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 128 (Echo Reply) are present, which do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error and reply messages.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or patterns in other logs, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted. If ICMP type 8 traffic spikes in future logs, reassess for ping flood indicators.
