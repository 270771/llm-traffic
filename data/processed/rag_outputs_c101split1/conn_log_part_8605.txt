Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic does not contain ICMP type 8 packets, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the lack of suspicious patterns and the ICMP type mismatch, no immediate threat is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or repeated connection attempts from the same source IP to the destination IP, which could indicate the start of a ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
