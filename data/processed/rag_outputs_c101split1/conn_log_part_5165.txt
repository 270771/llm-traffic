Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
