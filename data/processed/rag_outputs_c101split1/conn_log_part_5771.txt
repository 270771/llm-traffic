Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log snippet indicates the connection state as "OTH" (other), and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present or indicated. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in future logs to confirm if any suspicious ICMP activity occurs. Also, monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs to detect potential ping floods.
