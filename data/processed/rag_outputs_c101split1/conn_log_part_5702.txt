Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but ICMP type 3 traffic typically indicates network errors or unreachable hosts rather than an attack. Without evidence of excessive echo requests or abnormal traffic volume, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to identify potential network misconfigurations or routing issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
