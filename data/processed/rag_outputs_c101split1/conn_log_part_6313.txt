Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly for any high-rate ICMP Echo Requests to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for other types of network anomalies such as SYN floods or UDP floods, as the current logs show many TCP connection attempts with SYN flags but no successful connections (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- If suspicious TCP connection patterns persist, apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or port scanning once available.
