Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries.
- ICMP traffic, especially type 8 (Echo Request), is required to identify ping floods.
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- The connections show mostly failed TCP handshakes (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), which may indicate scanning or failed service attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The failed TCP connections (S0) could be investigated further for possible reconnaissance or scanning activity.

Next steps:
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for ICMP Echo Requests.
- Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts (S0) for potential scanning or DoS attempts.
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to identify if these failed connections relate to other attack types.
