Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the ICMP type and lack of anomalies, this traffic appears benign or related to legitimate network diagnostics.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood mitigation. However, further investigation could include monitoring for ICMP echo requests (type 8) with high frequency from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods.
