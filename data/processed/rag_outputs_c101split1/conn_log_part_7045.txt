Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP type codes 11 and 128, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 128 corresponds to Echo Reply in IPv6, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior or other types of ICMP misuse.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Review network baseline to confirm these ICMP types are expected in normal operations.
