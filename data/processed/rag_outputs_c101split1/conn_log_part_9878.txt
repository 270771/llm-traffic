Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.72.129.52 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013236.0997 to 1641013236.1042). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.243.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.243.137.200, 133.243.254.165, 133.243.224.147, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.72.129.52. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 35.72.129.52 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
