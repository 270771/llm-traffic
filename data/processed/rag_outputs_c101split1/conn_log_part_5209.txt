Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state flags, as these may indicate a port scan or other reconnaissance. Apply heuristics related to scanning behavior (e.g., repeated SYN packets without completion) and monitor for potential intrusion attempts. Further packet capture focusing on ICMP traffic should be conducted to conclusively rule out ping floods.
