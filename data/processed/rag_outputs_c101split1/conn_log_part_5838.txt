Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections with no indication of ICMP traffic, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The absence of ICMP records means no ping flood pattern is present.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP logs specifically for type 8 packets to detect ping floods. Also, review TCP SYN flood heuristics if scanning or SYN flood is suspected.
