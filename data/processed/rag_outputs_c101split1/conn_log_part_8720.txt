Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries, but only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only type relevant for ping floods. However, these entries are isolated and do not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding. The other ICMP types (3, 128) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to ICMP Echo Request flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any source IPs show a sudden spike in ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential DoS symptoms.
