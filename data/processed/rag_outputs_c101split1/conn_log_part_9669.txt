Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP record shows type 128, which is an ICMPv6 Echo Request, not an ICMP type 8 (IPv4 Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The second record shows ICMP type 8, which is a valid ping request, but there is only a single instance with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other signs of flooding, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency.  
- Investigate if the ICMPv6 Echo Requests (type 128) are unusually frequent, as they could indicate a similar IPv6-based reconnaissance or DoS attempt.  
- Establish heuristics to detect volume-based anomalies in ICMP traffic for future detection.
