Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood and suggests no related ICMP-based attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate other logs (e.g., ICMP-specific logs or packet captures) to confirm the absence of ICMP flood activity.  
- Monitor for unusual TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or other attacks.  
- If suspicious TCP connection patterns persist, apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or port scanning for further analysis.
