Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- Explanation: Multiple ICMP connections originate from the single source IP 161.4.185.99 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting multiple destination IPs in rapid succession. This pattern of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests to various targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

- Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 (High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack" as per standard network security classifications.

- Involved IPs and ports:
  - Attacker/source IP: 161.4.185.99
  - Target IPs: 163.45.192.188, 163.45.20.138, 163.45.96.94, 163.45.185.85, and 133.105.31.159
  - ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
  - Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 161.4.185.99 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flooding attempts from this or other sources.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar patterns in the future.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack if it originates externally.
