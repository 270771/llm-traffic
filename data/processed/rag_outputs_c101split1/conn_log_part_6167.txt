Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 0, 1, or 3, but none are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 1 = Destination Unreachable, 3 = Source Quench or other control messages) suggest normal or other control traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or volume of ICMP control messages, as excessive ICMP type 3 or 1 messages could indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
