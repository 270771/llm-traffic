Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log entries with ICMP traffic (protocol 17 = UDP here, but ICMP is protocol 1; however, the log shows UDP with ICMP-like fields, which is unusual) do not indicate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) anywhere. The ICMP type field is either missing or not equal to 8.
- Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.
- The majority of connections are TCP with SYN packets (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, but none match the ICMP Echo Request pattern required for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:
- Investigate the UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154 to 133.105.137.x addresses, as repeated UDP packets with S0 state and destination ports 443/445/441 may indicate scanning or other reconnaissance.
- Verify if the UDP traffic is legitimate SIP or other protocol traffic or part of a different attack vector.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to confirm the presence or absence of ICMP Echo Requests in future traffic.
