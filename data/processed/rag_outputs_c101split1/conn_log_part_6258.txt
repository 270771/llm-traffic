Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping).  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic with ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- Both entries have connection state "OTH" (other), indicating no established connection, but the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without these, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate.  
- Investigate if any other logs show increased ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests if volume increases.
