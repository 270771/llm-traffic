Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection states are "OTH" (other), indicating incomplete or unusual connection termination, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs (133.227.58.122 and 202.28.120.11) to the destination IPs (183.65.140.118 and 203.78.143.78).  
- Apply standard ICMP traffic monitoring heuristics once available to detect potential flooding or reconnaissance activity.
