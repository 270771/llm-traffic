Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and other types. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- The entries with ICMP type 8 are isolated and do not show signs of high volume or rapid repeated requests from a single source to a single destination, which are characteristic of ping floods.  
- The other ICMP types present are not type 8, so they do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination suggests no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in other protocols.  
- If suspicious ICMP traffic patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving thresholds on packet rate and volume.
