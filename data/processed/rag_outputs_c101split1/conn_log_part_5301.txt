Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field is "tcp"). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets that would indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not observed at all, the condition for a ping flood is not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan or connection attempts without completion would fall under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, often labeled as heuristic 1 or 2 in common taxonomies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts with no session establishment for possible scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these attempts are benign or part of a larger attack pattern.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or unusual ICMP types in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
