Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not shown here.
- The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), likely scanning or failed connection attempts, but no ICMP echo requests or floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping floods applies.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics (commonly heuristic #1 or #2 in many taxonomies), but without explicit data, this remains speculative.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or filtering to capture any future ICMP echo request floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to detect possible scanning or other attack patterns.
