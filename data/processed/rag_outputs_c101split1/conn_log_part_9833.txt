Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal or error-related ICMP messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or connectivity issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
