Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a connection state of "OTH" and does not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 indicates this is not a ping flood but potentially other ICMP traffic. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields to determine if other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts are occurring.
