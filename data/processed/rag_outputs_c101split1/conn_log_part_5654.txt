Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 11 and 13, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp Request) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP behavior, only type 8 packets are relevant for ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 and 13 packets to determine if they are part of a different reconnaissance or network scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on unusual ICMP traffic patterns for further analysis.
