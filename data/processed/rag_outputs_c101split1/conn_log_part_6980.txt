Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly indicated as type 8 (Echo Request). The first entry shows ICMP with no type specified, and the second entry has a duration of 5.635743 seconds with 2 packets of 112 bytes, which does not indicate a rapid flood of ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood. Also, the ICMP type 11 in the second entry corresponds to "Time Exceeded," not Echo Request (type 8), so it is not a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known ping flood heuristics or classifications apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 11 traffic (Time Exceeded), which may indicate network routing or TTL issues rather than an attack.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) frequency to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs for accurate detection.
