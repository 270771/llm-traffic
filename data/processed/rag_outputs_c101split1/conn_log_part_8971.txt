Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 3 messages are being generatedâ€”this could indicate network misconfigurations or other connectivity issues worth examining. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP type 8 packets should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
