Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single event with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ping floods require multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a target, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame.  
- Monitor for any spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP error messages that could indicate other network issues or attacks.
