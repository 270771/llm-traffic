Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 1, 3, and 11, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Specifically:  
- Entry 1: ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable)  
- Entry 2: ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply)  
- Entry 3: ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded)  

Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which relies on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 packets may indicate network issues or traceroute-like activity rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.139.211, 133.227.58.122, 202.101.171.237) for unusual behavior or repeated ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If network performance issues are observed, correlate with these ICMP error messages to diagnose routing or connectivity problems.
