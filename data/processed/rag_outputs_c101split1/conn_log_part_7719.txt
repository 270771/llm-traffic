Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 entry from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.125, but it is a single event, not a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is not observed here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for possible network issues or other anomalies.  
- Collect more data or enable alerting on ICMP echo request rates to catch future ping flood attempts.
