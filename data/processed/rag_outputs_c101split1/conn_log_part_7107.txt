Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is ICMP but not type 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any Echo Request (ICMP type 8) packets in other logs or timeframes to confirm if ping flood attempts exist. Also, monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Replies that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
