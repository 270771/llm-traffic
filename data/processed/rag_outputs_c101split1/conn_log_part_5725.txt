Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is "-", indicating no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed packet data to identify ICMP types and flags. Confirm if other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns exist that may indicate different network issues or attacks.
