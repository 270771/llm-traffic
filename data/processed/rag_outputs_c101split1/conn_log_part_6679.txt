Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic represents a single ICMP echo reply, not a flood of echo requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies since no suspicious pattern is detected. Further investigation is not required based on this single entry, but monitoring for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source would be prudent to detect potential ping floods.
