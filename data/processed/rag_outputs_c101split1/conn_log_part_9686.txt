Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or other reconnaissance. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods. If ICMP logs become available, specifically check for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from single sources to targets.
