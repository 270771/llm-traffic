Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.90.37, 133.243.32.96, 157.206.126.243) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.223.127.239 and 18.46.237.125) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641013231.33x). This pattern of many sources sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to a single or few targets is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, which aligns with the known ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior fits the heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination" and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.243.x.x and 157.206.x.x ranges targeting destination IPs 52.223.127.239 and 18.46.237.125. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the targeted hosts (52.223.127.239 and 18.46.237.125) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if feasible.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential compromised hosts within the source IP ranges and remediate accordingly.
