Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 13 and 1. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood attack, but neither entry has type 8. Type 13 corresponds to Timestamp Request, and type 1 corresponds to ICMP Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) messages to ensure they are not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential related network issues or attacks.
