Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.15.100, 133.243.232.155, 133.243.182.46, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 3.203.247.100 in a very short time window (timestamps all around 1641013223.6). This pattern of many echo requests from multiple sources targeting one host is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, which matches the known ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**, and taxonomy class **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.203.247.100 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.203.247.100.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack closer to the source if possible.
