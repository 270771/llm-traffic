Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP traffic, especially with type 8 (Echo Request), is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The traffic mostly shows UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connection attempts with states like S0, REJ, and OTH, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The observed traffic could warrant investigation for potential scanning or SIP-related anomalies, but it is unrelated to ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture and analyze ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets on port 5060 for possible SIP scanning or abuse.
