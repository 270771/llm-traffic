Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries show ICMP type 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request" messages, not type 8 (echo request) required for ping floods. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8).

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP type 13, it may be legitimate timestamp requests or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate whether the volume or frequency of these timestamp requests is abnormal or part of a reconnaissance attempt. Monitor for any escalation to ICMP echo requests or other suspicious ICMP types. If unusual patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP reconnaissance or scanning.
