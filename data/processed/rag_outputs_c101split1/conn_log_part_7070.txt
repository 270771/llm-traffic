Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the Zeek ICMP code field, which is "3" in this entry. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 3 is a normal network error message, not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency would be necessary to detect ping floods.
