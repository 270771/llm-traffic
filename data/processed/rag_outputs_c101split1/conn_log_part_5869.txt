Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack patterns such as SYN floods or port scans are clearly indicated here, as most TCP connections show S0 (SYN sent, no reply) states but no overwhelming volume or repeated attempts from the same IPs that would suggest a flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. Typically, heuristic #1 corresponds to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" would apply to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Monitor for repeated SYN attempts or other TCP anomalies that might indicate different DoS attacks.  
- Enable anomaly detection tools that log ICMP types and volumes for more precise detection.
