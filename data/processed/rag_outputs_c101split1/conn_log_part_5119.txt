Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, and no ICMP traffic is detected, no other attack type can be confidently inferred from this data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture Echo Requests and Replies.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
