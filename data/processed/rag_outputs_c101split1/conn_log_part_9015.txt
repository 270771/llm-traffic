Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1 or other values, but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. The absence of ICMP type 8 means these are not ping requests and thus do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 1 traffic (ICMP destination unreachable or other control messages) to ensure it is not symptomatic of other network issues or reconnaissance. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) would be prudent.
