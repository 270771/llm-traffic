Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.206.172.130, 157.206.143.105, 157.206.252.138, etc.) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114) within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013220.311xxx to 1641013220.313xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a few targets is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single/few targets**, and the taxonomy class is **T1: ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service**.

- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 157.206.x.x range (e.g., 157.206.172.130, 157.206.143.105, 157.206.252.138, etc.)
  - Destinations: Primarily 3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114
  - ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
  - Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the targeted hosts (3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
  6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required for operations.
