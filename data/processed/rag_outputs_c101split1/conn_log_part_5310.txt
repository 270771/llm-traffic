Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as the current log only shows TCP connections.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other anomalies such as SYN floods or port scans, as many TCP connections show SYN sent (S0) and failed flags, which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.
