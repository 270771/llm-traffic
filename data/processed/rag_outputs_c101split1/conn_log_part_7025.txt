Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The ICMP type 0 typically corresponds to Echo Reply, which is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity or anomalies in different protocols or logs, as these ICMP packets alone do not indicate an attack. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume or other unusual patterns is recommended.
