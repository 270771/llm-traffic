Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, 11, and others. Only the entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) could indicate ping traffic. However, there is only a single record with ICMP type 8 (from 173.20.80.33 to 163.45.128.88) and it shows a very low packet count (30 packets) and short duration (0.007657 seconds), which does not match the high volume, sustained traffic pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

Other ICMP types (3 = destination unreachable, 11 = time exceeded) are not related to ping floods and indicate different network conditions or errors.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. If heuristics were available, a ping flood would typically be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to ICMP echo request volume.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or abnormal ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Correlate with network performance issues or alerts from IDS/IPS systems.
