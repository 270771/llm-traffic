Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The connections show mostly TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts, but not ICMP flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable logging and monitoring for ICMP traffic specifically to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify if these TCP attempts are part of a broader scanning campaign.
