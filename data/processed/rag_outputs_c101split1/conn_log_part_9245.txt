Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the ICMP type and connection state (OTH), this appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.135.92 to the destination 207.98.148.224. If volume spikes or anomalies appear, investigate for potential ICMP-based attacks.
