Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as its absence may indicate logging gaps.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity in TCP traffic, as many entries show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts worth further analysis.
