Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0, 2, 129, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no other suspicious indicators, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP types observed (0 = Echo Reply, 2 = Unknown/Reserved, 129 = ICMPv6 Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) to ensure they are expected in the network context. Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or other unusual traffic patterns.
