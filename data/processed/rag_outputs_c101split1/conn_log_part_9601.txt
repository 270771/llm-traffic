Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log entries is consistently 8, which corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping operations. However, the packet counts and intervals do not indicate an overwhelming volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood attack. For example, the packets from 54.254.197.94 to 163.45.252.114 and 163.45.255.232 show only single or very low counts (8 packets each) over short durations, which is normal ping behavior rather than flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target, overwhelming the targetâ€™s network stack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Request rates from these IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity or if other protocols show anomalies.  
- If ICMP traffic volume increases significantly, apply rate limiting or filtering rules to mitigate potential ping floods.
