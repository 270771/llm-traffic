Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, no specific attack can be identified.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 traffic between 202.244.71.101 and 167.31.163.72 to determine if it is part of reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
