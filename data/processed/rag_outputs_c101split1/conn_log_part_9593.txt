Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one source to many destinations—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the targets with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood." These are standard classifications for ping flood attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.254.197.94  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.65.5, 163.45.203.253, 163.45.54.126, 163.45.65.110, 163.45.199.154, 163.45.67.173, 163.45.247.225, 163.45.2.152, 163.45.164.177, 163.45.52.169, 163.45.238.249, 163.45.247.45, 163.45.2.179, 163.45.183.181, 163.45.199.252, 163.45.54.119, 163.45.139.2, 163.45.72.5, 163.45.67.15, 163.45.199.144, 163.45.67.188, 163.45.183.50  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.254.197.94 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other DoS attempts from this or related IPs.  
3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Implement or verify existing ICMP rate-limiting policies to prevent similar volumetric attacks.  
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IP is known to be malicious or from a high-risk region.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify any collateral impact and improve detection heuristics.
