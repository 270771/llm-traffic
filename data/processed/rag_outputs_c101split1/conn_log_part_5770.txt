Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the log entries are mostly 3, 0, and 8. Only two entries have ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, these entries do not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate a flood. The timestamps and counts do not reflect a sustained or overwhelming number of ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy with heuristics related to high ICMP Echo Request rates.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 1.208.224.244 and 203.78.143.78 sending ICMP type 8 packets to ensure they are legitimate pings and not precursors to an attack.  
- Enable rate limiting or alerting on ICMP traffic if volume spikes occur.
