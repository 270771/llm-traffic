Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- There are no multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no evidence of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.  
- Establish heuristics to flag repeated ICMP Echo Requests for future detection.
