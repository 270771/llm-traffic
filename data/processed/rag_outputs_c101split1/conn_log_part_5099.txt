Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given TCP/UDP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN packets (S0) without successful connections, possibly indicating scanning but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or other suspicious ICMP types.  
- Analyze connection attempts for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity, given the many SYN packets without completion.
