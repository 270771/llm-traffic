Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 13 traffic could be legitimate network diagnostics or time synchronization attempts.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 13 packets that might indicate another form of reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
