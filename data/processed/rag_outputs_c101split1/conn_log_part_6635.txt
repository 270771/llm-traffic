Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0, 1, or other than 8. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the required ICMP type for a ping flood. The traffic appears to be other ICMP message types, possibly Echo Replies (type 0) or Destination Unreachable (type 3), but not Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages seen from 163.45.240.190 to multiple destinations, as a high volume of these could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration. Monitoring for unusual ICMP type 8 traffic should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
