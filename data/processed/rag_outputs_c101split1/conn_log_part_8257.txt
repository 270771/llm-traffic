Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate only one packet with no signs of flooding (no high packet count or repeated requests).  
- The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The OTH state and low packet counts suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests to the same destination.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for potential emerging threats.
