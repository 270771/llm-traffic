Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet (4th column after source IP) shows values 3, 8, 11, etc. Only entries with ICMP type 8 represent echo requests (pings). Here, only one entry has ICMP type 8 (first line: 172.23.68.231 â†’ 133.105.15.129), but it is a single event, not a flood. The other entries are ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard definition, a ping flood requires multiple rapid ICMP echo requests (type 8) targeting a host, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 for any unusual ICMP echo request patterns over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets to confirm or rule out a ping flood.  
- The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics, which could be investigated separately.
