Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.232.167.29 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013234.6). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic patterns for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 130.187.x.x subnet (e.g., 130.187.19.241, 130.187.18.156, 130.187.19.214, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.232.167.29 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 69.232.167.29.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs generating the flood traffic; consider blacklisting or blocking these IPs upstream.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact on the targeted host and ensure availability.
  5. If possible, deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
