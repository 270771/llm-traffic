Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 11, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which are not used in ping flood attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out ping flood.  
- No other clear attack pattern is evident from the data; these ICMP types may indicate network troubleshooting or normal error messages rather than an attack.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
