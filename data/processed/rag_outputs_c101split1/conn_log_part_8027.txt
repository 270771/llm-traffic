Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods. The entries show ICMP protocol with state "OTH" (other), and no indication of repeated Echo Requests or unusually high packet counts from a single source to a destination. The packet counts are very low (1 and 58), which does not match the high-volume pattern typical of ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the specific ICMP types involved by extracting ICMP type codes from packet payloads or detailed logs. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or repeated connection attempts from the same IPs. If ICMP type 8 traffic volume increases significantly, reassess for ping flood indicators.
