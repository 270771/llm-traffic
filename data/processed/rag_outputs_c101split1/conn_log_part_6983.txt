Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate floodingâ€”only a single connection with a short duration and low packet count is present. The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of excessive ICMP Echo Requests or rapid repeated pings from a single source to a target, which are characteristic of ping flood attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for rate-limiting or blocking rules on ICMP traffic.
