Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 157.206.153.34 to 106.224.180.93, with 224 packets over 3 seconds, which is not sufficient evidence alone to confirm a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have type 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no known ping flood patterns are matched.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from 157.206.153.34 to 106.224.180.93 for any sudden spikes or sustained high rates. Investigate if these packets correlate with network performance degradation or alerts from other monitoring tools.
