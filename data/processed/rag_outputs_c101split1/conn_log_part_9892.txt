Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.72.129.52) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013236.18). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources flooding one target—is a classic indicator of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target in a short time frame.  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.169.225, 133.243.90.37, 133.243.163.19, 133.243.173.39, 133.243.111.140, etc.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible.  
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
