Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood but rather error or control messages.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP behavior, these entries do not represent a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages (types 1 and 3) from these IPs, as this could indicate network misconfiguration, routing issues, or other network problems that might affect connectivity or be symptomatic of other network issues.
