Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.
- The protocol field is either "udp" or "tcp"; no ICMP entries are present.
- Even where UDP traffic is present (e.g., source IP 45.121.95.154 to various destination IPs on port 5060), there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The ICMP type field is not shown explicitly, but since no ICMP protocol entries exist, no ping flood can be inferred.

No other attack type is clearly indicated from this snippet:
- The TCP connections mostly show S0 state (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.
- UDP traffic to port 5060 (commonly SIP) is present but without volume or type details to suggest flooding or amplification attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided.
- Without explicit heuristics, the observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns (ICMP type 8 flood).
- The S0 TCP state could relate to heuristic "Port Scan" or "Connection Scan" (commonly heuristic 1 or 2 in many taxonomies), but this is speculative without context.

Next steps:
- Investigate the UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential SIP-related abuse or scanning.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable detailed ICMP logging to capture type and code fields for future detection.
