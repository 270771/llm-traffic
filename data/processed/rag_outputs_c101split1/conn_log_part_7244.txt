Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 138.128.86.213 to destination 163.45.129.195, but it appears as a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks correspond to heuristic categories involving ICMP Echo Request floods (type 8) with high packet rates, which are not observed here.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency. If volume increases significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network traffic for other ICMP types that may indicate different issues (e.g., type 11 for routing problems).
