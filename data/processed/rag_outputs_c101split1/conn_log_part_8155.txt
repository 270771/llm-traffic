Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

No other attack types are clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on these connection attempts. Also, monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
