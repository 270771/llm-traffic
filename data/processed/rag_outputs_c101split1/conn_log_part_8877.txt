Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries with various ICMP types. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, these entries do not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate a ping flood. The other ICMP types (0 and 11) are not relevant to ping floods. The count of packets per connection is 1 in all cases, indicating no flood-level traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated connection attempts with ICMP type 8.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics and alerts for potential DoS conditions.
