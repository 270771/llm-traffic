Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 7 (Address Mask Request), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 7 (Address Mask Request) are generally benign or diagnostic messages, not indicative of flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 7 traffic is expected in the network environment, as it is uncommon and could indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood attack.
