Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be a series of TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) for possible TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or capture to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any alerts on TCP scanning or other suspicious behavior.
