Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 packets may indicate network issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure network stability and proper routing. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
