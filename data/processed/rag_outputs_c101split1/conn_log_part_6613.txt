Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP types in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are 3, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP types observed correspond to:  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  

These types do not indicate a ping flood or typical ICMP flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or other anomalies since ICMP Destination Unreachable and Timestamp Requests can be part of network diagnostics or error reporting.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
