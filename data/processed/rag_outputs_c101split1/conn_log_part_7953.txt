Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 11 is typically used for diagnostic or error messages, not an attack vector.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.145.55.236 and destination 39.100.70.217 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages, which could indicate routing loops or other network problems.
