Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, a single or very limited number of ICMP type 8 packets do not constitute a ping flood attack. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to one or multiple destinations, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match known ping flood heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (45.225.96.135) to any destination.  
- Investigate the source IP 45.225.96.135 for any other suspicious activity.  
- If a surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify accordingly.
