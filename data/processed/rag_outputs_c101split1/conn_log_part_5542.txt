Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP and UDP connection attempts; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot match known ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture Echo Requests and Replies.
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources to identify possible flooding.
