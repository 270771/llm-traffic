Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (100.84.99.85) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the standard ping request. The rapid succession of these requests from many different source IPs within the same second strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS systems).  
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 100.84.99.85  
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.227.157.54, 133.227.182.253, 133.227.100.0, etc.)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 100.84.99.85.  
2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating attack patterns.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.  
6. Ensure critical services on 100.84.99.85 have redundancy or failover to mitigate impact.
