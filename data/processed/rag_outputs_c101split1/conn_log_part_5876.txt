Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 6th column after source IP and port) is `1` and `0` respectively, neither of which is `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" and type 0 to "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.250.250.10 and 133.227.58.120) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other hosts.  
- If high volumes of ICMP type 1 or 0 messages are observed, consider if network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based attacks (e.g., ICMP unreachable floods) might be occurring.
