Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 11th column after the source port) is either missing or not equal to 8 (Echo Request).  
- Specifically, the entries have ICMP type values of "-" or "0" or "1", none of which correspond to type 8 required for a ping flood.  
- Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood attack.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the given data. The anomaly CSV contains no records, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and rates.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic exceeding normal thresholds to detect potential future ping floods.
