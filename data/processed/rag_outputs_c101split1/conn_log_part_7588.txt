Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods, but the volume and pattern here do not indicate flooding. The entries for type 8 are sparse and involve different destination IPs (133.105.230.243 and 133.105.230.244) with only single packets each, not a high-rate flood. The ICMP type 3 entry is a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of repeated, high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination. Investigate if any other unusual ICMP types or error messages increase, which could indicate other network issues or attacks.
