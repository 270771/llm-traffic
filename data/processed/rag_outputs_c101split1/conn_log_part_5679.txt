Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 0, 3, 8, and 11. According to the instruction, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping flood traffic. Here, the only entry with ICMP type 8 is from source IP 157.206.73.9 to destination 152.222.130.26, but it is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or repeated echo requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps: Investigate the single ICMP Echo Request from 157.206.73.9 for normal network behavior or benign scanning. Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
