Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0 and 11, but none with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Entry 1: ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded)  
- Entry 2: ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) â€” actually, this entry has type 8, but only a single packet is seen, not a flood pattern.  
- Entry 3: ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded)  

However, the single ICMP type 8 packet from 157.206.169.2 to 42.108.139.144 does not constitute a flood. There is no evidence of high volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination in rapid succession.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP Echo Request floods would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to traffic volume and packet type.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 packets as they may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but are not indicative of a ping flood.  
- Collect anomaly data and apply heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume for more accurate detection.
