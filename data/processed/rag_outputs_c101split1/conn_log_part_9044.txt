Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but are sparse and originate from multiple different source IPs targeting a single destination IP (3.23.69.72).  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP that would indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (e.g., type 3 and 1) are present but do not correspond to ping flood behavior.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and packet counts are very low (mostly zero or one), inconsistent with flooding patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of volume and pattern rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the multiple ICMP Echo Requests to 3.23.69.72 for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or repeated requests from the same IPs.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on unusual ICMP traffic patterns to detect early signs of flooding.
