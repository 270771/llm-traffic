Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs that include ICMP protocol details to confirm no ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IP.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. Typically, heuristic #1 corresponds to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" would be assigned if detected.
