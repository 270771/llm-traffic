Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (3.241.1.60) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The frequency and volume of these ICMP Echo Requests within a short time frame strongly indicate a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- The consistent packet sizes (56 or 112 bytes) and very short intervals between packets (as low as ~0.007 seconds) further support this conclusion.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."
- Taxonomy class: "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service Attack."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 3.241.1.60
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 3.241.1.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for additional signs of volumetric ICMP attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or blackholing on affected network segments.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
