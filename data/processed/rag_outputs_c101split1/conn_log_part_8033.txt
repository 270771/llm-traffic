Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.192.82.251, from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013222.32x).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target IP is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests.
- The absence of anomaly CSV data and heuristic context requires assigning a default heuristic and taxonomy:
  - Heuristic: ICMP Flood Detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS systems)
  - Taxonomy: Network Denial of Service (DoS) Attack via ICMP Flood

Involved IPs and ports:
- Victim IP: 3.192.82.251 (destination)
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.244.8, 157.206.112.153, 157.206.142.14, 157.206.20.244, 157.206.120.173, 157.206.120.189, 157.206.120.252, 157.206.1.6, 157.206.164.238, 157.206.75.186, 157.206.112.141, and 50.255.98.90
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests to the victim IP (3.192.82.251) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Identify and block or throttle traffic from the source IPs involved if they are confirmed malicious or unauthorized.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or escalation.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood filters or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
