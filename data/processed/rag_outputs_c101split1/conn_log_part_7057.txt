Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. Given the absence of type 8 traffic and no anomalies, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these or other IPs. Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or scanning activity.
