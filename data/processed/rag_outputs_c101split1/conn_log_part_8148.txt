Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0, which for ICMP corresponds to type/code fields), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 203.78.136.177 and 201.112.141.176 to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or error message misuse. Collect more detailed ICMP type/code information and volume metrics to identify potential anomalies.
