Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log snippet indicates ICMP protocol with no further detail on ICMP type. Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets in high volume.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in logs. Confirm if any other ICMP types (e.g., Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded) are present that might indicate other network issues or attacks. Also, monitor for volume spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
