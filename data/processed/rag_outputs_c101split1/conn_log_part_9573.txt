Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.140.233 sending ICMP type 11 and 157.206.202.113 sending ICMP type 0 for possible network issues or misconfigurations, as these ICMP types can be part of diagnostic or error messages.
