Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections. The ICMP type field is the fourth column after the source IP. The entries have ICMP types 3, 3, and 8 respectively. Only the last entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). The other two entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.

A ping flood attack requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or more sources targeting a victim. Here, only a single ICMP type 8 packet is logged, with no indication of flooding or high volume. The other ICMP traffic is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple ICMP Echo Requests or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 sending the single ICMP Echo Request to 133.105.184.131 to confirm if this is benign or part of normal network scanning.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests volume from this or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts on ICMP traffic anomalies.
