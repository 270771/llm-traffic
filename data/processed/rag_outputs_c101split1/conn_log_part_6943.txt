Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the "1" in the 6th column after source IP, which corresponds to ICMP type 1, i.e., "Destination Unreachable"). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be assigned confidently.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of ICMP type 1 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood. Monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic would be necessary to detect ping floods.
