Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 11 and 8 (the first entry has type 8, the second has 11). Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods, but the first entry with type 8 is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The second entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks correspond to heuristic categories involving ICMP Echo Request floods (e.g., heuristic #1: ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS:PingFlood."

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated connection attempts.  
- Correlate with other logs or network monitoring tools to detect volumetric ICMP floods.
