Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, and no such data is visible here.
- The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential port scanning.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for possible ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.
