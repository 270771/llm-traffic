Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.153 on port 8080) for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any ICMP traffic in other logs to detect potential ping floods.
