Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, SYN scan or connection flood heuristics would apply to the TCP SYN attempts, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the network for ICMP traffic separately to confirm no ping flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for SYN flood or port scanning activity given the high number of TCP SYN attempts with no established connections.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection for ICMP traffic to capture potential ping floods in the future.
