Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0 and ICMP type field 8 not present), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other ICMP Echo Request entries (type 8) in the logs or a high volume of ICMP traffic from the source IP 203.78.143.78 to 201.98.32.254. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic spikes would be prudent.
