Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic is likely benign or related to network diagnostics rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in high volume from the same source IP (203.78.132.154) to the destination (89.247.69.180). If such traffic appears, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
