Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 1 (indicated by the field with value `1` after the destination IP), which corresponds to "ICMP Destination Unreachable" messages, not ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP type observed, this traffic likely represents normal network error or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to ensure there are no underlying network misconfigurations or connectivity issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
