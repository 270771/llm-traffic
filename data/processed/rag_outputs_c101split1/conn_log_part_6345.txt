Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show a type value of 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the connection state is "OTH" (other), and the packet counts are very low (only 1 packet each), indicating no high-volume or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood. A ping flood attack requires a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the low packet count and lack of sustained traffic, this does not match a ping flood or any other volumetric ICMP attack pattern.

Next steps: Continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request rates or repeated connection attempts from these IPs. If packet counts rise significantly or connection states change to reflect ongoing sessions, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
