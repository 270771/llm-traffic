Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single entry with no evidence of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found to support suspicious activity. Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that a ping flood requires multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets, which are not present here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 18.75.223.59 for any unusual traffic patterns if more data becomes available.  
- Confirm if the ICMP type 3 messages (from 203.78.139.178) indicate network scanning or misconfiguration, as these can sometimes precede other attacks.
