Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All the conn.log entries show UDP or TCP traffic; none indicate ICMP traffic.
- The ICMP type field is absent or not equal to 8 (echo request), which is required to identify ping floods.
- The UDP traffic is mostly on port 5060 (SIP signaling), and TCP traffic is on various ports, none related to ICMP.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, no ping flood heuristic applies.
- The observed traffic may indicate scanning or SIP-related activity but not a ping flood.
- Without anomaly data or heuristic context, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential SIP abuse or DoS attempts.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect possible ping floods in the future.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP echo request anomalies.
