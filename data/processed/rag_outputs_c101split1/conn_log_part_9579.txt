Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.008 seconds per connection). This pattern matches the classic ping flood behavior where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request Flood**, and the taxonomy class is **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.197.94; Destination IPs include 163.45.162.155, 163.45.124.249, 163.45.179.26, 163.45.151.149, 163.45.179.148, 163.45.13.140, 163.45.12.208, 163.45.11.164, 163.45.151.158, 163.45.13.220, 163.45.13.143, 163.45.11.38, 163.45.11.35, 163.45.100.30, 163.45.179.78, 163.45.100.9, 163.45.129.70, 163.45.129.84, 163.45.205.41, 163.45.205.64, 163.45.205.2. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.197.94 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
  4. Notify affected network administrators to prepare for potential collateral impact.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if this is part of a larger coordinated attack or reconnaissance effort.
