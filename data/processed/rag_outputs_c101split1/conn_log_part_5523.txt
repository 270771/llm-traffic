Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts correspond to heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, often classified under "Network Scanning" in anomaly taxonomies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion for possible port scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for comprehensive threat detection.
