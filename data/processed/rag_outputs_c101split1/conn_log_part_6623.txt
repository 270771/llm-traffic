Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which are not indicative of ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic may indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of misconfigurations or other network problems.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these IPs to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
