Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field is "tcp"). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, many with SYN flags set (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically. Enable or review ICMP logs to detect any high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs. Also, monitor for SYN flood or port scanning activity given the high number of SYN-only TCP connections seen here.
