Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 34.17.112.111 from various source IPs (133.243.248.6, 133.243.121.110, 133.243.154.194, 133.243.243.74, 133.243.68.62, 133.243.193.193, 133.243.152.205, 133.243.152.200, 133.243.4.128). All these entries have ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The rapid succession of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to a single target is a classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**.  
- Taxonomy class: **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Target IP: 34.17.112.111 (no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: 133.243.248.6, 133.243.121.110, 133.243.154.194, 133.243.243.74, 133.243.68.62, 133.243.193.193, 133.243.152.205, 133.243.152.200, 133.243.4.128

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 34.17.112.111.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if not required for legitimate operations.
