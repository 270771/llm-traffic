Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP types correspond to normal network error and reply messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any surge in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues.
