Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in any of the entries. The ICMP type is indicated by the 4th field after the timestamp and UID, which in these entries are 11, 11, and 3 respectively. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded," and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," neither of which are Echo Requests (type 8).  
- Since none of the ICMP packets are Echo Requests, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 11 and 3 messages are typically related to network errors or diagnostics, not flooding attacks.  
- The heuristic for ping flood would require repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostic messages and not part of a reconnaissance or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.  
- Collect more detailed logs including ICMP type codes and packet rates for better anomaly detection.
