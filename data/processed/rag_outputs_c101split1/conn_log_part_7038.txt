Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 3, and 129, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 129 is an ICMPv6 Echo Reply variant, none of which indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages (Destination Unreachable) as they may indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP traffic volume and type to improve detection accuracy.
