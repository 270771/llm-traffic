Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the SYN packets with flags S0 and F indicate many failed TCP connection attempts, which may suggest a SYN scan or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags that are not completing handshakes (S0 state) for potential scanning or probing activity. Monitoring for SYN flood or port scanning heuristics would be appropriate.
