Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.192.28.218 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps around 1641013211.7). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-volume ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS systems).  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.192.28.218 (ICMP type 8, no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: 133.243.196.6, 133.243.107.6, 133.243.107.71, 133.243.241.237, 133.243.216.133, 133.243.118.154, 133.243.241.166, 133.243.82.114

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.192.28.218 at the network perimeter firewall or router.  
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious or unknown/untrusted.  
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.  
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.  
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and plan for incident response escalation if the attack persists.
