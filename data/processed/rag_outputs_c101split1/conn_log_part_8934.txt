Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP address, 18.46.237.125, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013230.11). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one host—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP flood detection:  
- Heuristic #1 (commonly used in ICMP flood detection): High rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single destination.  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 18.46.237.125 (ICMP type 8 destination)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.223.200, 133.227.164.0, 133.227.200.0, 133.227.178.246, 133.227.235.201, and many others.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.46.237.125.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.  
6. Ensure the target host has appropriate firewall rules to mitigate ICMP flood impact.
