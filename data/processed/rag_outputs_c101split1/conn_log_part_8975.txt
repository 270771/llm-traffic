Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 0, and the second has ICMP type 2. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), neither entry matches the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no other suspicious indicators, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 2 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of a different reconnaissance or denial-of-service pattern.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP requests from the same source IPs (157.206.201.249 and 163.45.21.198) to the destination IPs (3.197.247.113 and 115.59.180.64) for early detection of potential ping floods.
