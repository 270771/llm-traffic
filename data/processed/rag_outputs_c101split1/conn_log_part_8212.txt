Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 163.45.144.185. However, there is only a single record with ICMP type 8 and no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests indicative of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 11 traffic may warrant investigation for possible network routing or TTL issues but does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination at high frequency. If such patterns emerge, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the cause of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure network stability.
