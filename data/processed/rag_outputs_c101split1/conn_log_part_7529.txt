Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log entry for ICMP does not indicate type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but is not sufficient evidence of an attack here.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.243.9.15 to 62.191.100.213 to detect potential future ping floods.
