Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All provided Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), but no evidence of flooding or abnormal ICMP traffic.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy data are available from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Typically, ping flood detection relies on ICMP Echo Request volume and type, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or high-rate connection attempts that could indicate other DoS attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture potential ping flood activity.
