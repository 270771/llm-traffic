Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply) from 157.206.204.185 to 52.223.127.239, and the second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) from 133.243.19.170 to 222.189.226.118. Since neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to normal network operations: Echo Reply (type 0) and Time Exceeded (type 11), which are not indicative of an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 11 messages, as excessive Time Exceeded messages can indicate network issues or traceroute activity, but this is not a ping flood. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 floods should continue.
