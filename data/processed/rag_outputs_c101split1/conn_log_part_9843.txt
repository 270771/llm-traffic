Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either UDP or TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- The protocol field (last column) is either 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP), with no ICMP (protocol 1) traffic present.
- Since no ICMP traffic is logged, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are seen, this cannot be a ping flood.
- The traffic mostly shows failed connection attempts (S0, D flags) on various ports, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns with typical port scanning heuristics (e.g., multiple failed TCP connection attempts).
- If heuristics were available, this would likely fall under a "Port Scan" or "Reconnaissance" taxonomy class.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IP 45.121.95.154, which repeatedly attempts UDP connections to port 5060 on multiple destination IPs, possibly SIP scanning.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or unusual patterns in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable ICMP logging and anomaly detection to capture and analyze any future ICMP-based attacks.
