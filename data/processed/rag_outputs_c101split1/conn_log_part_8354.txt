Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 entry is from source IP 45.225.96.135 to destination 203.78.168.139, but it has zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual echo request traffic. The other entries with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of actual ICMP Echo Request traffic and no anomaly flags, no ping flood or other attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 45.225.96.135 if it begins sending multiple echo requests rapidly.  
- Enable logging or alerting on sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
