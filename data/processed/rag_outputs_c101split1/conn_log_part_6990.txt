Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages.
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages.

These types often indicate network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (80.71.252.153 and 5.131.34.101) for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity, as repeated ICMP error messages can indicate probing or routing problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect possible future ping floods.
