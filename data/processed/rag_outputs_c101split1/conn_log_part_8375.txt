Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (last numeric field before the final dash), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between IPs 133.227.58.122 and 180.187.124.151 to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different ICMP-based reconnaissance or response anomaly. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
