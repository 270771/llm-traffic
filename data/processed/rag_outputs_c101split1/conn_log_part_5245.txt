Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before logging.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods in the future.
