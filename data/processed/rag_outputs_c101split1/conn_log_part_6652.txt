Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple destination unreachable messages are generated from 133.105.128.252 to different IPs. This could indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance attempts. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this source is recommended.
