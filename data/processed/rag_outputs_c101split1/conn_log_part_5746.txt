Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show protocol 11 (ICMP) traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or indicated as "-" (not type 8). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal ICMP traffic volume that could indicate evolving reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
