Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are either TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack types are clearly indicated in the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state) but no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic #1 often relates to volumetric ICMP attacks, and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" would apply to ping floods, but these cannot be assigned here due to lack of data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to confirm the presence or absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for alerts related to ICMP anomalies.
