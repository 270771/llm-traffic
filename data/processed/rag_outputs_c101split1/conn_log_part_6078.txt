Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 13 and 3, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, and type 13 indicates Timestamp Requests, which are not related to ping floods.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messaging issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
