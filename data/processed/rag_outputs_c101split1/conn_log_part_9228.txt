Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 185.178.78.208 and destination IP 133.105.34.121 for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance, but no immediate ping flood mitigation is necessary.
