Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic may warrant further investigation to understand the purpose of the timestamp requests, but it does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated timestamp requests that could indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
