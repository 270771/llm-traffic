Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it is not a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an attack initiation. There is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 packets indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed traffic does not match typical DoS or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal ICMP traffic rates.
