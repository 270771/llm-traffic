Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections, but only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which are from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination IPs 133.105.230.95 and 133.105.230.94. The other entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods. The presence of only two ICMP Echo Requests with no high volume or rapid repetition does not match the pattern of a ping flood, which typically involves a large number of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from 151.105.96.5 or other sources. Investigate if these ICMP type 8 packets increase rapidly, which could indicate the start of a ping flood. Also, verify if the ICMP type 11 packets are related to network misconfigurations or routing issues.
