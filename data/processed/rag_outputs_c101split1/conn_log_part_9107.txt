Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 13 (Timestamp). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed ICMP types typically indicate network diagnostic or error messages rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are legitimate network devices and not part of a reconnaissance or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would be indicative of a ping flood.
