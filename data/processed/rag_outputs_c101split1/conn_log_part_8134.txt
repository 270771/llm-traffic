Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 133.227.134.152 to 23.151.159.113 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping).  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic from 133.227.159.48 to 167.46.181.16 with ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, not a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP echo requests from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- Both entries have a count of 1 packet each, indicating no flooding behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if any other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.
