Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is observed, the condition for a ping flood attack is not met.
- The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed traffic aligns with typical TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts rather than ICMP-based flooding.
- SYN scan heuristics typically relate to reconnaissance, not flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
