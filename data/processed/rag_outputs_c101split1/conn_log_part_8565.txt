Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic may be legitimate timestamp requests or other ICMP control messages.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 13 messages that could indicate other reconnaissance or timing-based attacks. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
