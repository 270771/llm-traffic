Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be a series of TCP connection attempts, many with the S0 flag indicating SYN packets without completion, which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context and consider monitoring for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks.
