Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field is "tcp"). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be a series of TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify if these TCP attempts are part of a broader attack pattern.
