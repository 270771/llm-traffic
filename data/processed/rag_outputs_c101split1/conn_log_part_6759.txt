Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.227.90.79) from multiple distinct source IPs within the same second (timestamp 1641013210.87). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is a classic indicator of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP echo requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target) and fits the taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 54.227.90.79 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in the 133.243.x.x range
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.227.90.79.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts and adjust firewall policies accordingly.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
