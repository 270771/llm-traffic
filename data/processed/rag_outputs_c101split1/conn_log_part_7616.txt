Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.195 and 133.105.230.194). There is no indication of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would characterize a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the limited data, this traffic appears to be normal ping activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from this source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Additionally, verify if these pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
