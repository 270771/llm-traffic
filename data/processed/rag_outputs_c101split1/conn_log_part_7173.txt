Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic for potential misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or unusual volume spikes.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
