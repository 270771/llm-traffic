Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.179, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if multiple such entries appear in a short time frame indicating volumetric ICMP traffic.
