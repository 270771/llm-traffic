Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with some packets having type 8 (Echo Request), which is necessary for ping floods. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding. The entries are sparse and isolated, not a rapid or high-volume stream typical of ping flood attacks.  
- The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 133.243.75.87 to 157.79.182.56, and the second similar entry from 133.243.232.249 to the same destination, but only single packets are logged, not a flood.  
- The first log line with ICMP type 8 is actually 0, which is Echo Reply, so it is not a ping request.  
- No anomaly records are found to support suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that isolated ICMP Echo Requests do not constitute an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 157.79.182.56 is experiencing any service degradation or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets occurs, re-evaluate for ping flood using volume and rate heuristics.
