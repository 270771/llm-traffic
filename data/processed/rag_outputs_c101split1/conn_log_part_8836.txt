Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. Since no ICMP Echo Requests are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no indication of a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets are present, as they may indicate network issues or other benign ICMP activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual ICMP traffic volume that could signal a developing ping flood attack.
