Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic in the snippet shows two entries with ICMP types 5 and 1, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm the target, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to Redirect (type 5) and Echo Reply (type 1), which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate a flooding attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP Redirect messages (type 5) from 202.250.230.253 to 209.148.222.139 to ensure network routing is configured correctly and no misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts are occurring. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
