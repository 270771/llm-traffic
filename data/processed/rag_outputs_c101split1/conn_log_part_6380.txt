Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8, which is Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not match the known pattern for ping floods, which rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the connection state "OTH" (other) and flags "F F" indicate these are likely isolated or incomplete ICMP exchanges, not a flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types explicitly.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts, as these packets might be part of other network scanning or probing activities.
