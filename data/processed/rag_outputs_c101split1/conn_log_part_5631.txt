Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 10, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 10 (Router Advertisement) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network diagnostic or control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source and frequency of these ICMP messages to ensure they are legitimate network operations and not part of another anomaly such as ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent.
