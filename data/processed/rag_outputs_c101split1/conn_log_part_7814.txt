Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 157.206.246.74 and 157.206.229.133 targeting 174.95.41.114 and 3.196.199.185 respectively, and one from 151.105.96.5 with ICMP type 8 as source port targeting 133.105.230.41 with type 0 as destination port.  
- However, these entries do not show a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The timestamps are sparse and no repeated bursts of ICMP type 8 packets are evident.  
- The other ICMP entries have types other than 8, which per the given knowledge, do not indicate ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to assign a heuristic number or taxonomy class. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to a destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic patterns for any unusual spikes or repeated requests that may indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
