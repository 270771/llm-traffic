Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 11, or 129 (from the port fields, which represent ICMP type/code in Zeek logs). None have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.

The traffic appears to be ICMP messages of other types (e.g., type 11 = Time Exceeded, type 0 = Echo Reply, type 129 = ICMPv6 Echo Reply), which are normal control messages or responses, not indicative of flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies if unusual volumes persist.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate a ping flood attempt.
