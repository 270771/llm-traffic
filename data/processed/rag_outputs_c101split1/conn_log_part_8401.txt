Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from two source IPs (133.243.92.243 and 133.243.78.56) to the same destination (163.84.73.84). However, the volume and frequency of these packets are very low (only single entries with no rapid repetition or high packet counts), which does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume and rate thresholds.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any suspicious behavior or prior alerts.  
- Verify if other types of ICMP or network traffic anomalies are present that might indicate different attack vectors.
