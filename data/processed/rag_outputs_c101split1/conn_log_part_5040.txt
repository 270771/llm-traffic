Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- No heuristics or taxonomy classes are explicitly found or applicable here due to lack of ICMP or anomaly data.
- The S0 state indicates connection attempts without completion, often related to reconnaissance rather than flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.191, 193.96.13.122) for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with other logs (e.g., ICMP logs, firewall logs) to confirm absence of ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
