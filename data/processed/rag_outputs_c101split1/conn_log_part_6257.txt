Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
