Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, no ping flood can be detected.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no indication of ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these TCP SYN failures would be reconnaissance or scanning activity, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN failures for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.
