Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate a ping flood attack. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP Echo Replies alone does not indicate malicious activity.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any corresponding ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from the same source IP (203.145.55.236) to the destination (66.104.113.89) to rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that may indicate different network anomalies.
