Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 173.20.80.33 to 163.45.128.163, with 30 packets over approximately 7.6 milliseconds. This volume and rate do not indicate a flood-level attack. The other ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the low packet count and absence of type 8 floods, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic volumes to better detect future anomalies.
