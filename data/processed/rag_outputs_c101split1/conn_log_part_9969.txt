Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The connection shows a single ICMP packet with no indication of repeated or high-volume traffic typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific label. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple similar ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from the same source IP (202.250.202.134) to the destination (167.46.181.97). Monitor for volume spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
