Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods, as many TCP connections show S0 state (SYN sent, no response), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts. This aligns with heuristic patterns for reconnaissance or DoS but is not a ping flood.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if available.
