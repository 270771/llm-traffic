Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the destination port field which is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.157.48 and destination IP 167.46.174.226 for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-based issues, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
