Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response, not an attack initiation. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 202.250.202.134 to the destination 46.119.84.136 is recommended to detect any future suspicious activity.
