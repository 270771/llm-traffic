Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" (last numeric field before the dash), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between 133.227.58.120 and 23.12.184.89 to ensure it is legitimate response traffic and not part of a different ICMP-based anomaly. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
