Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has ICMP type 128 (indicated by the Zeek ICMP code field "128"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity or different types of ICMP abuse, such as ICMP flood variants using other types. Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request traffic (type 8) to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
