Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the "1" in the source port field, which corresponds to ICMP type 1, "Destination Unreachable"). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic here likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

No attack is present. If further investigation is warranted, focus should be on monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from a single source IP to detect potential ping floods.
