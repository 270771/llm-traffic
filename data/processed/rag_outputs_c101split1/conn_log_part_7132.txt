Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 8, and 10. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. While two entries have type 8, the volume and pattern do not indicate floodingâ€”each record shows a single packet (`-` in count fields and no repeated rapid connections). The third entry is type 10 (Echo Reply), which is not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.243.206.29 and 157.206.59.155) for unusual ICMP activity patterns over time.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
