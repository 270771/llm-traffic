Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the 11th field (ICMP type/code). In the first entry, it is "-", indicating no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). In the second entry, the ICMP type is "0" (Echo Reply), not "8".  
- Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the required pattern.  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type "-", which is not type 8, and the second is type 0, which is a reply, not a request.  
- No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known ping flood heuristics or classifications apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.243.229.185 and 195.157.244.2) for other suspicious activity, as ICMP traffic is present but not indicative of ping flood.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other unusual traffic patterns.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes with type 8, re-evaluate for ping flood heuristics.
