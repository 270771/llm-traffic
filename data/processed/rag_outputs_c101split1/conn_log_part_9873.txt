Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet with a duration of 0.171866 seconds and 392 bytes, which is insufficient to indicate flooding or a volumetric attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not attacks.  
- ICMP type 8 alone does not indicate flooding without volume or rate anomalies.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.247.187 if it starts sending large volumes of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for volumetric or rate-based alerts.
