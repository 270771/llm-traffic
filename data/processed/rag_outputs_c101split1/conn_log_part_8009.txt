Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from IP 65.148.121.107 to 203.78.134.246, but it shows a single packet (count=0 or 1) and no signs of flooding or high volume. The other entries with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics focus on high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet for legitimacy but no immediate threat is detected.
