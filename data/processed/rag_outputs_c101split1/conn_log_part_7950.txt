Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the Zeek conn.log corresponds to ICMP type 11, Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 11 messages or other ICMP types that could indicate network issues or other attack vectors. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets in large volume should continue to detect potential ping floods.
