Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Since ICMP type 13 is typically used for network diagnostics rather than flooding, this traffic appears benign.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood mitigation. However, monitoring ICMP traffic for unusual volume or other ICMP types (especially type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
