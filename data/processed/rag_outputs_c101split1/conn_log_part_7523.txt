Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Request (type 8) entries in other logs or over a time window to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving these IPs.
