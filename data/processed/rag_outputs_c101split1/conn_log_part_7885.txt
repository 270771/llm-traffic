Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods.  
- Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which are not indicative of ping flood attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomalies are reported, no immediate attack is present. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 packets could indicate network issues or misconfigurations worth investigating further, such as routing problems or firewall blocking.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate network devices for possible misconfigurations causing ICMP errors.  
- Establish heuristics to detect ICMP-based anomalies in future logs.
