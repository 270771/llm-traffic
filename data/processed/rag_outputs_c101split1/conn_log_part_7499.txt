Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connection attempts; there is no ICMP traffic recorded, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. All entries show TCP protocol with SYN or other TCP flags, indicating connection attempts or scans rather than ICMP flooding.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious ICMP activity or flooding behavior. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, the absence of ICMP echo requests means no ping flood heuristic applies here. The traffic appears consistent with possible TCP scanning or connection attempts, which could warrant investigation for reconnaissance but is not a denial-of-service ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential scanning or other TCP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS alerts for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
