Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the fourth field after the source IP (e.g., `3`, `11`, `8`), which corresponds to the ICMP type. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), specifically the line with source IP 40.34.71.119 and destination IP 203.78.170.98. The rest are types 3 or 11, which are not echo requests and thus not ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, since the majority of ICMP traffic is not type 8 and there is no evidence of high-volume echo requests from a single source, this does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a large volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8).

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type 8 traffic from 40.34.71.119 to 203.78.170.98 for volume and frequency over a longer time window to rule out low-rate scanning or reconnaissance. Also, monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests that could indicate an emerging ping flood.
