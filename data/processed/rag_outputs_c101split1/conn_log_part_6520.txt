Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. The connection attempts mostly show TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures for potential scanning or probing activity. Correlate with ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP traffic is present that might indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks.
