Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes related to ping flood or other attacks are found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.

Next Steps:  
Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood attempts. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP echo request spikes. If suspicious TCP connection attempts persist, consider analyzing for TCP SYN flood or port scanning attacks.
