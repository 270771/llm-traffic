Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The majority of ICMP traffic entries show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping requests.
- Multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests originate from a single source IP (13.26.219.230) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013235.435xxx).
- This pattern of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 13.26.219.230 (source port 8, ICMP Echo Request)
- Multiple destination IPs in the 133.251.x.x range (e.g., 133.251.128.210, 133.251.129.4, 133.251.148.253, etc.)
- ICMP protocol, no ports in traditional TCP/UDP sense, but ICMP type 8 is key.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 13.26.219.230 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other DoS patterns from this or related IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise.
4. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls, such as ICMP rate limiting or blackholing offending traffic.
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering with the ISP if attack volume is large or persistent.
