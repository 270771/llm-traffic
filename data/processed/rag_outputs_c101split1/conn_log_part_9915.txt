Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. These entries indicate error messages rather than ping requests, so this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but typically:
- Heuristic for ping flood involves high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is usually "Denial of Service" or "Flooding Attack."

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP type 3 messages are generatedâ€”this could indicate network misconfiguration or other connectivity issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
