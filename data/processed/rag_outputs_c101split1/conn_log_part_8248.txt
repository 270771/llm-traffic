Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11, 8, and 0. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood activity. Here, only one record has ICMP type 8 as the source port (172.23.68.231 → 133.105.75.83), and another record shows ICMP type 8 as the destination port (133.243.126.190 → 172.23.68.231). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood; the logs show single connection entries with no evidence of rapid repeated requests from one source to one destination.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no direct correlation to known attack heuristics can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic from 172.23.68.231 and 133.243.126.190 further to confirm normal behavior, as ICMP type 8 is present but not in a flooding pattern.  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
