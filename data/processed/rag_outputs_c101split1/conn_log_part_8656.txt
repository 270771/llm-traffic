Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.72.141.69) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013227.69). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messagesâ€”the core of a ping flood attack. The rapid succession and multiplicity of targets strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP echo requests, consistent with a ping flood pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood**.  
- Taxonomy class: **T1: Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 18.72.141.69  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, no ports (ICMP does not use ports).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 18.72.141.69 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., traffic shaping, anomaly-based IDS signatures).  
5. If possible, implement ingress filtering to prevent spoofed ICMP traffic.  
6. Document the incident and update firewall/IDS rules to prevent recurrence.
