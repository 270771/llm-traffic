Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response rather than an attack initiation. No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. 

No other attack patterns are evident from the single log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
