Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic shows isolated ICMP packets with no indication of high volume or repeated echo requests typical of ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or routing issues, this traffic may warrant investigation for network misconfigurations or diagnostic activity but does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) or sustained high-rate ICMP traffic. If such patterns emerge, re-evaluate for potential ping flood attacks.
