Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The UDP traffic is mostly on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), and TCP connections show SYN attempts with no established sessions, indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not ping flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply here.  
- The observed traffic may align with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics (e.g., repeated SYN attempts with no completion), which typically fall under taxonomy class "Network Scanning" or "Reconnaissance."

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154, as multiple failed attempts could indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts.  
- Monitor TCP SYN attempts from various IPs for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts explicitly.
