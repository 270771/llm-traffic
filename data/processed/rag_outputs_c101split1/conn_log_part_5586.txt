Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request logged, not a high volume or flood of such packets. A ping flood attack requires a large number of ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 11 traffic may warrant investigation for potential network issues or traceroute activity but is unrelated to ping flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a sustained increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 sending ICMP type 11 messages if unusual network behavior is suspected.
