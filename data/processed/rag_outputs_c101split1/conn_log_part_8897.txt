Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm the target with echo requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed ICMP type 3 traffic likely represents normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or network issue causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns.
