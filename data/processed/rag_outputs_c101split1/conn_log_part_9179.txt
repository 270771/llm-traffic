Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, primarily involving source IP 45.121.95.154 targeting various destination IPs on UDP port 5060 and multiple TCP ports.
- There is no indication of ICMP traffic in the logs, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The protocol numbers at the end of each line (6 for TCP, 17 for UDP) confirm no ICMP traffic is present.
- The traffic pattern appears to be connection attempts (S0 state) rather than ICMP echo floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or a UDP flood attempt.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Consider enabling deeper packet inspection or flow analysis to identify other attack types such as UDP floods or SIP-based attacks.
