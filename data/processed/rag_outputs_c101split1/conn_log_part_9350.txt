Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 for potential SIP scanning or abuse. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for any ICMP traffic not captured here to rule out ping floods conclusively.
