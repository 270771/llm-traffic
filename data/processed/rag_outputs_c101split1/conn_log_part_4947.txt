Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristics or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these entries would be "TCP SYN scan" or "failed connection attempts," which are not ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to identify if these TCP attempts are part of a larger attack campaign.
