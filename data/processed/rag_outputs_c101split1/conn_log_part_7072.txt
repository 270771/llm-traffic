Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 13 and 10, which correspond to ICMP "Timestamp" and "Router Advertisement" messages, respectivelyâ€”not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 10 and 13 are generally not associated with ping floods but could be part of other network activities or reconnaissance.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (133.227.130.250 and 133.243.92.234) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, especially if these messages are frequent or unexpected in your environment. Monitor for any escalation to ICMP Echo Requests or other attack types.
