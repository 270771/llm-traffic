Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the packet counts are extremely low (1 and 0 packets), indicating no high volume or flood pattern. A ping flood requires a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no flood or other suspicious pattern is detected, no attack is present.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, verify if these isolated ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign scanning.
