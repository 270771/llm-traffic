Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) packets all targeting a single destination IP address (35.72.129.52) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High-volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target**, and the taxonomy class is **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.119.174, 133.243.102.61, 133.243.107.23, 133.243.214.204, 133.243.107.63, etc.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.72.129.52.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network and host performance metrics on 35.72.129.52 for signs of service degradation.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall rules accordingly.
