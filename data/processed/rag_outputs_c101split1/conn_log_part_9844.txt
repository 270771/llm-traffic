Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic is an ICMP timestamp request, which is generally benign or used for network diagnostics.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP requests from the same source IP (157.206.101.113) to the destination (105.196.84.91). If such patterns emerge, further investigation into potential ICMP-based attacks should be conducted.
