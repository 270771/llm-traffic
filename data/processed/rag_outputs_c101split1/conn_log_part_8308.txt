Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The presence of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) indicates scanning or failed connection attempts, but these do not match ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed traffic resembles reconnaissance or port scanning activity rather than a denial-of-service via ICMP.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential scanning or probing activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any unusual ICMP traffic or other anomalies.
