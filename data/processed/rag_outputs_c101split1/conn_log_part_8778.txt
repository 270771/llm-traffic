Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network errors or unreachable destinations, which may warrant further investigation but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or a different network issue.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
