Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed ICMP traffic appears to be legitimate network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.101.171.238 and destination IP 66.104.113.92 for any unusual patterns of ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies in extended logs to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or network issues.
