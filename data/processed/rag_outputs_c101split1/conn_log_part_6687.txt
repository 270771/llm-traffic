Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding: each record shows a single packet (`orig_pkts` = 1) and very low byte counts, with no rapid repetition or sustained high packet rate from a single source to a target. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a Destination Unreachable message, not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics look for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 message (from 202.250.250.10 to 202.113.154.147) to ensure it is not symptomatic of other network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect longer-term logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP-based reconnaissance or DoS attempts.
