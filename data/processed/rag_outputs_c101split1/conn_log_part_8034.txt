Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 3.192.82.251 with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- Multiple source IPs (157.206.199.221, 157.206.195.131, 157.206.227.126, 157.206.195.134) are sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession to the same target, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The high frequency and multiplicity of sources targeting a single IP with ICMP type 8 strongly indicate a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: ICMP Echo Request Flooding**.
- Taxonomy class: **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attackers: 157.206.199.221, 157.206.195.131, 157.206.227.126, 157.206.195.134
- Victim: 3.192.82.251
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the victim host 3.192.82.251 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools such as blackholing or scrubbing services if attack volume escalates.
