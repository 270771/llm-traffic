Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP records or types are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (icmp.log) are available to confirm the absence of ICMP traffic.  
- Review for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or scanning, as many connections show S0 (SYN sent, no response) states, which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning or connection failures once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
