Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type field as "-", indicating the ICMP type is either not recorded or not type 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify their ICMP types and payloads. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP traffic patterns that could indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
