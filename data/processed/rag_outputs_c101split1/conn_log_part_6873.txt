Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) all targeting a single destination IP (3.192.28.218) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.243.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.243.68.59, 133.243.220.27, 133.243.157.254, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 3.192.28.218. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.243.0.0/16) at the network perimeter or firewall.
  2. Monitor the target host (3.192.28.218) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if the attack volume escalates.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts participating in a botnet.
  5. Prepare incident response to mitigate impact and notify affected stakeholders.
