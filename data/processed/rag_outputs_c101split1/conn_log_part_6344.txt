Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is the 4th column in the Zeek log snippet (values: 8, 8, 3). Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping requests relevant to ping floods.  
- While two entries have ICMP type 8, the packet counts and durations are very low (e.g., 30 packets in 0.001 seconds for one entry, but only a single packet in others), which does not indicate a flood-level volume or rate.  
- The third entry with ICMP type 3 is a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.  
- Taxonomy class would be "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 23.151.159.76 sending 30 packets in a very short time to 133.251.114.16 to rule out early-stage scanning or probing.  
- Enable alerting on ICMP Echo Request rates exceeding normal thresholds.
