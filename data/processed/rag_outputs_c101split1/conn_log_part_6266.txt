Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, there is only a single echo request recorded, not a high volume or flood of such packets. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source targeting the same destination, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same IP to the same target.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets indicate other network issues such as routing loops or TTL expiry.  
- Apply heuristics that flag high-rate ICMP echo requests as potential ping floods once more data is available.
