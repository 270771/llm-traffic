Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (35.72.129.52) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The connections occur within the same second (timestamp 1641013236), originating from numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.124.185, 133.243.69.82, 133.243.242.236, etc.). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources flooding a single target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target in a short time frame."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (no port for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.124.185, 133.243.69.82, 133.243.242.236, 133.243.230.81, 133.243.5.53, etc.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust defenses accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
