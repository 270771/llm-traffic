Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents ICMP replies rather than the flood of echo requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (133.251.128.196) or to the destination (193.96.13.157) in other logs to rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that may indicate different network issues or attacks.
