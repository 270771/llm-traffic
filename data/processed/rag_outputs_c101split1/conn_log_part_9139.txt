Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Unreachable Network," which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context, the default understanding is:  
- Heuristic: ICMP type must be 8 for ping flood detection.  
- Taxonomy: ICMP type 3 and 1 relate to network errors, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages (types 3 and 1) to determine if there are underlying network issues or misconfigurations causing these unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
