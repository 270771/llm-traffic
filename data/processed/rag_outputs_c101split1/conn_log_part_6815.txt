Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the connection duration is only 0.108126 seconds with a single packet (orig_pkts=8, resp_pkts=8 but no indication of high volume or sustained traffic), and the state is OTH (other), not indicative of a flood. There is no anomaly data or heuristic context to suggest this is part of a ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection record. Without multiple rapid ICMP echo requests or unusually high packet rates, this traffic appears normal.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. Further investigation should include monitoring for repeated, high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 35.83.191.13 to the destination 163.45.193.152 to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.
