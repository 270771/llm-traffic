Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.204.132, 133.243.67.85, 133.243.179.10, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.196.70.79 in rapid succession within milliseconds. This pattern of many hosts simultaneously sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting a single victim IP, overwhelming network resources.
- The most likely heuristic number would be "ICMP Flood Detection" (commonly heuristic #3 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range and destination IP 54.196.70.79. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/type.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.196.70.79.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to apply traffic filtering or blackholing if the attack volume is large.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and identify any additional attacking IPs.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS mitigation capabilities.
  5. Notify affected parties and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or outage.

This is a clear case of an ongoing ICMP ping flood attack targeting 54.196.70.79.
