Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type fields are 0, 1, 13, and 0, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type required for a ping flood. Since the defining characteristic of a ping flood is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match that pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) messages to ensure they are not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate a potential ping flood attack.  
- If suspicious patterns emerge in other ICMP types, consider applying relevant heuristics for ICMP-based reconnaissance or error message abuse.
