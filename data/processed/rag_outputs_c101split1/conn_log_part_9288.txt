Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.232.166.26) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013232.6xxxx). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 69.232.166.26 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.172.141, 133.243.9.13, 133.243.243.74, 133.243.147.231, 133.243.72.146, 133.243.108.142, 133.243.206.51, 133.243.172.235, 133.243.251.253, 133.243.251.255, 133.243.206.60, 133.243.66.123

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 69.232.166.26.
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
