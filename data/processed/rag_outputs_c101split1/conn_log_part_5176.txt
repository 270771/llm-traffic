Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), many of which are failing (F flag), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed pattern of many failed TCP connection attempts could align with reconnaissance or scanning activity, often labeled under heuristics related to network scanning or brute force attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs and ports.
