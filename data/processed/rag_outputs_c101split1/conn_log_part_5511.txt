Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The absence of ICMP traffic suggests no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is occurring.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP flows.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks indicated by TCP flags (e.g., SYN floods) since many TCP connections show S0 (SYN sent, no response), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts. These would fall under heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or port scanning once context is available.
