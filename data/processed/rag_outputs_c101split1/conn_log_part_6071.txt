Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code fields (3 and 3), which correspond to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages between 133.243.217.6 and 186.122.180.227, as frequent Destination Unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in volume or related anomalies.
