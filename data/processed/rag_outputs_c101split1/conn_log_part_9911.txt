Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes apply.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network captures to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated connection attempts that might indicate other attack types such as SYN floods or port scans.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for alerts related to ICMP or other suspicious traffic.
