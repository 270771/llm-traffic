Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings), but there is only a single connection record per source-destination pair with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The conn.log snippet shows isolated ICMP echo requests without evidence of flooding behavior such as numerous packets in a short time frame or sustained high traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood is detected, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP echo requests from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate if these IPs have other suspicious activity or if network performance issues correlate with ICMP traffic spikes.
