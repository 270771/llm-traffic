Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from different source IPs (133.227.106.11, 133.227.137.165, 133.227.106.18, 133.227.157.72, 133.227.182.249, 133.227.157.109, 133.227.112.2) targeting a single destination IP (100.84.99.85). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," which typically falls under a taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Sources - 133.227.106.11, 133.227.137.165, 133.227.106.18, 133.227.157.72, 133.227.182.249, 133.227.157.109, 133.227.112.2; Destination - 100.84.99.85; Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (100.84.99.85) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse and consider blacklisting or blocking them.
  5. Inform network operations to prepare for potential escalation or wider attack patterns.
