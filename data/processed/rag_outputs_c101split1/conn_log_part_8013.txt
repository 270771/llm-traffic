Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (107.102.62.64) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources including 157.206.133.192, 157.206.205.155, 157.206.249.131, 157.206.13.221, 157.206.77.142, 157.206.77.48, 157.206.34.245 targeting 107.102.62.64 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (107.102.62.64) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
  6. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
