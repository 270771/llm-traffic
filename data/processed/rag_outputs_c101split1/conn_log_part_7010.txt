Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed are 8 and 129. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods, but the first record shows only a single ICMP packet with a duration of 6.885 seconds and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests. The second record is ICMP type 129, which is not type 8 and thus not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high rate or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match ping flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if any other anomalies or alerts arise related to ICMP traffic volume or unusual patterns.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
