Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 150.227.97.96 and 217.174.50.217 to determine if it is part of a legitimate response or another benign ICMP message type. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
