Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8 and 128. ICMP type 8 corresponds to an Echo Request (ping), but the second record shows type 128, which is an ICMPv6 Echo Request. However, the volume and pattern of traffic do not indicate a flood; the counts are very low (1 and 0 packets respectively), and there is no evidence of rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood would show a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is absent here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. Investigate if any other unusual ICMP types or traffic patterns emerge that could indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
