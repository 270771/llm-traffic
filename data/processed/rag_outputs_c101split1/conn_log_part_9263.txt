Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an atypical or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply) to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different ICMP-based attack or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs.
