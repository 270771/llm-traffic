Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP: 35.72.129.52.
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct, all sending ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time window (timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a "Ping Flood" under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (commonly used for volumetric ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: DoS Attack - ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (receiving all ICMP Echo Requests).
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.189.178, 133.243.152.205, 133.243.217.6, 133.243.217.130, 133.243.82.174, etc.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Implement source IP filtering or geo-blocking if attack sources are from known malicious regions.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying anti-DDoS mitigation services.
5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood detection and mitigation steps.
