Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request) from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.202.24, which is a normal ping request. However, there is only a single such record, not a flood or high volume of echo requests. The second record is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping flood detection requires multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a target, which is not evident here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. Investigate if any hosts generate sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests, which could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
