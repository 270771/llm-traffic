Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP connections are present, each from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to different destination IPs. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if these isolated ICMP packets are part of a larger pattern by correlating with additional logs or network flow data.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes significantly, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests") and taxonomy class "DoS/ DDoS Attack."

Currently, no attack is present based on the provided data.
