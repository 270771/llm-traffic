Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column, which is `0` here, but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown. However, the conn.log entry shows the protocol as `icmp` and the state as `OTH` (other), with no indication that the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate this is a different attack type.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing full ICMP packet details, including explicit ICMP type and code fields, to confirm the nature of the traffic. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 202.125.201.18 to the destination 103.237.156.234 would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
