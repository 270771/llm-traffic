Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no other specific attack type can be confidently identified from this data.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies, as Zeek conn.log here only shows TCP connections.
