Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The logs mostly show failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, often classified under "Network Scanning" or "Reconnaissance" taxonomy.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs.
