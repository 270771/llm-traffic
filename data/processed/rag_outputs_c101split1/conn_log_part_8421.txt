Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic does not contain ICMP type 8 packets, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to indicate an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from the same source IP (157.206.164.238) to the destination (163.84.73.84) to detect potential ping floods. Also, investigate the reason for the OTH connection state to rule out other network issues.
