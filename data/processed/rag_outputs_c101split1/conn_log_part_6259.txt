Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise. The connection state "OTH" and zero retransmissions further support that this is not a flood but likely a normal ICMP error message exchange.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
