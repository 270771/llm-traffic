Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the "icmp" protocol and the ICMP type is shown as "3" in the source port field (4th column after timestamp and UID). ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, if heuristics were available, ICMP type 3 traffic would typically be classified under network error messages rather than flooding or DoS attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages, as they indicate unreachable destinations which could point to network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
