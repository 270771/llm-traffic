Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the log snippet are mostly not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. For example, entries show types 0, 3, 11, and 13, none of which correspond to ICMP Echo Request. Only one entry has type 8, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic.  
- The traffic does not exhibit the high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single or multiple sources typical of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security incident is present. However, the presence of various ICMP types (e.g., type 3 - Destination Unreachable, type 11 - Time Exceeded) could warrant further investigation into network issues or misconfigurations.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request traffic volume.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP error messages (types 3, 11, 13) to ensure they are legitimate and not indicative of reconnaissance or other network problems.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies due to lack of anomaly data.
