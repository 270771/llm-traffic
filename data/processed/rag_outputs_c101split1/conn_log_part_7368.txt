Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (value 3), which corresponds to an ICMP type other than 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are relevant for ping flood detection, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 traffic (Destination Unreachable) between 163.45.129.215 and 38.89.4.8 to ensure it is not symptomatic of network misconfiguration or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
