Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values are 3 and 11, which correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages often indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the high volume of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out misconfigurations or network problems. Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
