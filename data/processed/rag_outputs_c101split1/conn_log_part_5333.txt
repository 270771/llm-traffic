Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP packets are logged here.  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot match known ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs specifically for type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific monitoring and anomaly detection to capture relevant traffic.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP flood indicators.
