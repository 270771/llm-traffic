Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x range. All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid succession and multiplicity of these echo requests to many different hosts strongly match the known pattern of an ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with excessive ping requests to degrade network performance or availability.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood**.  
- The taxonomy class is **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.236.220.60  
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.1.81, 163.45.5.56, 163.45.19.186, 163.45.216.253, 163.45.224.47, etc.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 54.236.220.60.  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity from this or other sources.  
3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted IP ranges to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Consider blacklisting or blocking the attacker IP at upstream providers or via ISP coordination.  
5. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.  
6. Review and harden network devices to ignore or deprioritize ICMP Echo Requests if not required for legitimate operations.
