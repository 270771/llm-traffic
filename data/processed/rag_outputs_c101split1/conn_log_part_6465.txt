Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood attack. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate other ICMP message types unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity related to these IPs or ports.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that these ICMP messages are normal network control traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from these or other IPs to detect potential ping floods.
