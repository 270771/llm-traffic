Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, looking for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods. Also, monitor for SYN flood or port scanning activity given the abundance of SYN-only TCP connections.
