Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) all targeting the same destination IP 163.84.73.84 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013225.56). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood attacks is typically related to "ICMP Echo Request flood" (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 133.243.170.238, 133.243.8.250, 192.207.220.238, 157.206.21.4, 157.206.81.26, and others are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 163.84.73.84. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 163.84.73.84.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking IP ranges.
  4. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare to apply additional mitigation such as blackholing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet for further remediation.
