Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping requests. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed, this traffic may represent network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.250.230.253, 203.78.136.169) for unusual ICMP error message volumes that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
