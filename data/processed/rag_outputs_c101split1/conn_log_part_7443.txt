Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 8, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of repeated or volumetric ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high-frequency ICMP echo requests for future detection.
