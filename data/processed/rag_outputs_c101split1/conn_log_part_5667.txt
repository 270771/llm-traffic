Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 0, 1, 128, and 129, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP types present (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 128/129 = IPv6 Echo Request/Reply) to determine if other ICMP-based anomalies or misconfigurations exist.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Consider correlating with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify potential reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse.
