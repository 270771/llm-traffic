Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- ICMP traffic, especially with type 8 (Echo Request), is required to identify a ping flood attack. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.  
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed traffic aligns with common network scanning or failed connection attempts, which typically fall under reconnaissance or scanning categories rather than flooding.  
- The S0 state in Zeek conn.log usually indicates connection attempts without completion, often linked to scanning heuristics.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts (e.g., 45.121.95.154) for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for any future ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.
