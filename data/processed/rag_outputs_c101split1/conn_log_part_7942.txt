Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate traceroute or network diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.243.16.161 and 133.243.206.21) for unusual volumes or patterns of ICMP type 11 messages if network performance issues arise, but no immediate security response is warranted.
