Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding. The UDP entries are sparse and do not show flooding patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics, but this is not confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.180, 89.247.69.153) for potential scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP Echo Request floods or other anomalies.
