Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet corresponds to the 4th and 8th fields (source port and destination port fields are repurposed for ICMP type/code). Here, the ICMP type values are `3` (Destination Unreachable), not `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 packets (e.g., 133.243.229.102 and 203.78.141.148) to understand if these are legitimate network error messages or part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Consider enabling detailed ICMP logging or rate limiting if ICMP traffic volume spikes.

No ping flood is detected, but further analysis of ICMP error messages is recommended.
