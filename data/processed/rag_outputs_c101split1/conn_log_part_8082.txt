Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 128, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not indicate a ping flood. ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 128 is Echo Reply, which are not indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages to understand if there are network misconfigurations or other issues causing these errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
