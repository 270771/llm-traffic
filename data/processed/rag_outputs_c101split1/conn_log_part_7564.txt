Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.159.48 and destination IP 88.245.8.203 for any unusual traffic patterns or other ICMP types. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
