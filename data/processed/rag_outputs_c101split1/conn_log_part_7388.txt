Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 0 (indicated by the port field being 0), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further if it appears unusual in volume or pattern, focusing on the source IPs 133.227.58.120 and 203.78.136.185. Verify if these hosts are generating legitimate ICMP replies or other control messages. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect future ping flood attempts.
