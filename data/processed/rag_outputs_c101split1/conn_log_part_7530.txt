Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 103.198.220.26 to 133.105.25.152 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such connection record, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign labels. The lack of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If volume increases, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, verify if ICMP type 11 traffic is expected in the network or indicates routing issues.
