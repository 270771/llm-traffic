Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. For example, the entry with ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641013207.301438) shows a single connection with a duration of 0.475530 seconds and only 1736 packets, which does not indicate flooding or high-volume repetitive echo requests. Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 3, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 47.15.247.185 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 163.45.183.50 to confirm normal behavior, as legitimate ping traffic is present but not flooding.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal traffic volume that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
