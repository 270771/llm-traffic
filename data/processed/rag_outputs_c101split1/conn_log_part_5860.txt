Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns that require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. Given the absence of ICMP Echo Requests and no anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or scanning activity. Monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request surges that could indicate emerging ping flood attempts.
