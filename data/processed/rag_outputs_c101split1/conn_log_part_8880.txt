Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 222.175.165.148 to destination 133.105.196.28, with a single packet (count=1). The other ICMP entries have type 0 or 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of a ping flood. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would involve multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession.  
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from any source IP. Investigate the source IP 222.175.165.148 if multiple Echo Requests appear in subsequent logs, as it is currently the only host sending ICMP type 8 packets.
