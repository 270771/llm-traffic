Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting two distinct IP addresses: 34.27.172.201 and 54.241.41.56. The volume of ICMP Echo Requests arriving almost simultaneously from multiple source IPs (all starting with 133.243.x.x) strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where many hosts send continuous ping requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP flood attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple 133.243.x.x addresses (e.g., 133.243.208.203, 133.243.15.177, 133.243.183.234, etc.)  
- Destination IPs: 34.27.172.201 and 54.241.41.56  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none are applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other related anomalies.  
5. Consider blacklisting or quarantining the attacking IP addresses temporarily to reduce impact.  
6. Review and harden target hostsâ€™ ICMP handling policies to limit resource exhaustion.
