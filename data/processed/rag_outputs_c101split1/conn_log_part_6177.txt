Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types. Only entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are relevant for ping flood detection.  
- Among the entries, only two have ICMP type 8:  
  - 36.174.61.94 → 133.105.249.54  
  - 143.5.202.233 → 133.105.101.173  
- However, these entries show single or very low counts of packets (indicated by the last field being 1), not the high volume or rapid succession typical of a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are unrelated to ping floods and indicate different ICMP messages (Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded).  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 36.174.61.94 and 143.5.202.233 for unusual ICMP activity patterns.  
- Enable alerting on ICMP echo request rates exceeding normal thresholds to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.
