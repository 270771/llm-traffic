Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 128, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 128 is typically an ICMPv6 Echo Request, but the IPv6 packet shows no flood pattern or volume here. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 traffic often relates to network errors rather than attacks, and ICMPv6 Echo Requests alone do not indicate flooding without volume or rate anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume or rate of ICMPv6 Echo Requests in a broader dataset to rule out IPv6 ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
