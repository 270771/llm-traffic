Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 entry is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.216, but it appears as a single isolated event with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination indicates no ping flood pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP. Investigate the single ICMP type 8 event if it recurs or correlates with other suspicious activity. Also, analyze ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or other attack types such as reconnaissance or misconfiguration.
