Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state) for potential SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to confirm. If ICMP traffic is expected, verify if ICMP logging is enabled and functioning correctly.
