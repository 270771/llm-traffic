Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or DoS via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to verify if ICMP Echo Requests are present in high volume.  
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic or other DoS indicators.
