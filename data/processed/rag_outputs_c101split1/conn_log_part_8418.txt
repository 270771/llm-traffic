Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic with the destination port as 0 and ICMP type field is not explicitly given, but the presence of "OTH" state and no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) suggests this is not a standard ping request. Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type codes and frequency. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.136.178 to 104.140.140.25 to detect potential future ping floods.
