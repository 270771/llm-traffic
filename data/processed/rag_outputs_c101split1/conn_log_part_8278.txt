Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (52.196.212.42) sending numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.008 seconds per packet). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.196.212.42; multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); port field is 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 52.196.212.42 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flooding attempts from this or other sources.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
