Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections, but only those with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) qualify as potential ping flood traffic. Here, only two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (130.187.194.250→69.232.167.15 and 130.187.24.43→69.232.167.15). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood—there are only a few isolated ICMP Echo Requests, not a high-rate or sustained burst typical of ping floods. The other ICMP types (3 and 0) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping flood heuristics focus on high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 130.187.194.250 and 130.187.24.43 for unusual ICMP activity patterns.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
