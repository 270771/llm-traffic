Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-volume ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests in future logs.
- Verify network devices and sensors are configured to capture ICMP traffic for comprehensive analysis.
