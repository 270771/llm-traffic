Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry has type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry has type 0, which is an "Echo Reply," not an echo request either.  
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match the known ping flood pattern.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type here. The observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets with unusually high frequency from any source IP, which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.45.185.71 sending ICMP type 3 messages if these are unexpected in your environment, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
