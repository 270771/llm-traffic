Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be identified by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the provided snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to confirm a ping flood.
- The traffic consists mainly of UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts but not ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the best matching heuristic for the observed traffic would be:
- Heuristic: Potential UDP flood or SIP scanning (if further investigation warranted).
- Taxonomy: Network scanning or reconnaissance (class 6 or 17 traffic with many failed connection attempts).

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.200.x addresses on port 5060 for possible SIP scanning or UDP flood.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect actual ping floods.
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context for more precise classification.
