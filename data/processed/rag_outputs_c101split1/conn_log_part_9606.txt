Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 4th column after source IP) is 11 and 3, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest these packets are likely error or control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
