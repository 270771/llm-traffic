Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The connection attempts mostly show TCP SYN packets (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not flooding.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs (icmp.log) or packet captures for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm or rule out ping flood activity. Also, monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that could indicate a SYN flood or scanning activity.
