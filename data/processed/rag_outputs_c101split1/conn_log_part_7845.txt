Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 8, 3, and 10. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one record with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 203.78.143.78 to 103.12.73.6, and it shows a single connection with 32 bytes and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 10 = Router Advertisement) are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests for volume spikes or repeated requests from the same source IP (203.78.143.78) could be a prudent next step to detect potential future ping floods.
