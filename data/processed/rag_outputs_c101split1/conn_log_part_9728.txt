Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 and destination IP 93.173.209.119 for potential network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics, as ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or routing problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
