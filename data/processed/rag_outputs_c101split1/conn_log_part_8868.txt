Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 0, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," neither of which are used to initiate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of the ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are network misconfigurations or other issues causing unreachable destinations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection in the future.
