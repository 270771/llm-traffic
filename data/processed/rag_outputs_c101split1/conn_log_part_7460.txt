Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which does not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, which is not indicative of a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another attack type.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP Echo Replies alone does not indicate malicious activity.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in other logs to confirm potential ping floods. Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving 202.125.201.18 and 45.108.164.222.
