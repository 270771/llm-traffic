Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
Multiple entries show ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.197.247.113 from various source IPs (157.206.206.197, 157.206.151.215, 157.206.203.86, 157.206.124.225, 157.206.124.157, 157.206.242.129). The high frequency of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern. One entry also shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 10 (Router Advertisement), but these are isolated and do not negate the flood pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High-volume ICMP Echo Request flood**.  
- Taxonomy class: **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.197.247.113 (no port, ICMP protocol)  
- Attackers: 157.206.206.197, 157.206.151.215, 157.206.203.86, 157.206.124.225, 157.206.124.157, 157.206.242.129, and 45.225.96.135 (source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify network operations to monitor bandwidth and system performance on the victim host 3.197.247.113.  
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.  
6. Harden the victim system by disabling unnecessary ICMP responses if feasible.
