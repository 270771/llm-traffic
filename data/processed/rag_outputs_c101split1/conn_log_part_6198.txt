Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types appear frequently or in large volumes, they could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out network issues or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would be indicative of a ping flood.
