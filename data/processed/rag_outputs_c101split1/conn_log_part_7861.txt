Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The ICMP types are 13 (timestamp request) and 1 (destination unreachable), neither of which is type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that these ICMP types represent normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.139.178 sending ICMP type 13 (timestamp request) and 133.243.154.254 sending ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable) to ensure these are legitimate network operations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) or unusual traffic volume that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
