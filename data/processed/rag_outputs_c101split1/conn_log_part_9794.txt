Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field is the 4th column in the Zeek conn.log snippet. The entries show ICMP types 3, 11, and 3. Since none of these are type 8 (Echo Request), the traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest these are error or control messages, not flooding attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to understand if there is a network misconfiguration or routing issue causing excessive ICMP errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
