Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with various source and destination ports. There are no ICMP entries present, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state flags, as these may indicate a port scan or other reconnaissance. Look for heuristics related to scanning or brute force attempts in your anomaly taxonomy. Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for potential ping floods in the future.
