Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or denial-of-service via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this is not confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as absence here does not guarantee no ICMP activity.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
