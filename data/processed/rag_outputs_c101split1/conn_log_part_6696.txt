Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior related to these IPs or ports.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that only ICMP type 8 traffic can be considered for ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages; these could indicate network misconfigurations or other issues such as routing problems or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies that might indicate evolving attack patterns.
