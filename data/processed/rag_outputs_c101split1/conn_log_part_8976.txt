Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request logged, not a high volume or rapid succession of echo requests that would indicate a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.201.26 if multiple echo requests are observed over time.  
- Confirm normal network behavior by correlating with other logs or IDS alerts.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required.
