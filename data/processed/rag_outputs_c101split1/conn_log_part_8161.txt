Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume is extremely lowâ€”only single packets from two different source IPs to two different destination IPs, with no indication of rapid or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and no anomalies or repeated attempts are logged.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests or sustained traffic, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these isolated pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign scanning.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify under DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy.
