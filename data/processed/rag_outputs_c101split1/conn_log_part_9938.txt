Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 17 (last field), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 corresponds to ping requests, none of these represent ping floods.
- The traffic is predominantly UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and TCP connections with SYN packets but no established sessions, indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are available, the observed traffic aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity (TCP SYN scans) rather than a denial-of-service ping flood.
- Typical heuristic for scanning would be repeated SYN attempts without completion.
- Taxonomy class would be "Reconnaissance" or "Scanning" rather than "Denial of Service."

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x hosts on port 5060 for potential SIP-related abuse or scanning.
- Monitor TCP SYN attempts from various IPs for scanning patterns.
- Enable deeper packet inspection or IDS rules to detect SIP flooding or scanning signatures.
