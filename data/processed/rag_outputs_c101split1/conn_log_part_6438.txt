Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry has type 3, which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry has type 1, also not type 8, so it is not a ping flood either.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest another attack type.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no immediate security response is required. However, further monitoring of ICMP traffic for repeated echo requests (type 8) from the same source IPs could be useful to detect potential future ping floods.
