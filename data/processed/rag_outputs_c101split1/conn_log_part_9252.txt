Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the Zeek log corresponds to ICMP type 11, Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents legitimate ICMP Time Exceeded messages, possibly from traceroute or network path issues.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.122 and 133.227.58.120) for unusual volume or frequency of ICMP Time Exceeded messages if network performance issues are observed, but no immediate security threat is indicated by this data.
