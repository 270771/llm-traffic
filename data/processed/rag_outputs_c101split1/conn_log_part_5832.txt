Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with IDS alerts or firewall logs to confirm scanning behavior and consider blocking suspicious source IPs if confirmed.
