Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 13, 3, and 0. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. Types 0 (Echo Reply), 3 (Destination Unreachable), and 13 (Timestamp Request) do not correspond to ping flood traffic.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ICMP Echo Requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp Request) traffic for potential network issues or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Establish heuristics to flag excessive ICMP Echo Requests in future logs.
