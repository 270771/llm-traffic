Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is consistently `8`, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are all `OTH` (other), and the packet counts are extremely low (1 or 58 packets total per entry), with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from a single source to a single destination. A ping flood attack typically involves a very high rate of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target, which is not evident here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is clearly present, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs (151.105.96.5 and 2600:d3ff:fb87:cfb:39f:9c1c:aa7e:6edd) to the destination IPs. If volume increases significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign traffic.
