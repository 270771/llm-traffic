Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.196.199.185 from numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.141.170, 157.206.141.11, 157.206.141.219, 157.206.150.172, etc.) within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013220.3). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS systems).  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.196.199.185 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.141.170, 157.206.141.11, 157.206.141.219, 157.206.150.172, 157.206.170.255, 157.206.171.93, 157.206.165.2, 157.206.252.152, 157.206.143.249, 157.206.171.253, 157.206.115.166  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.196.199.185.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking IP addresses if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and prepare to escalate to incident response if service degradation occurs.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible to mitigate impact.
