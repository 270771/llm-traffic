Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port field (11) and destination port field (0), but these do not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no established session or typical ICMP echo request behavior.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 traffic (which corresponds to Time Exceeded messages) to determine if there is a network misconfiguration or other issues causing unusual ICMP activity. Monitoring for volume spikes or repeated ICMP error messages could be useful.
