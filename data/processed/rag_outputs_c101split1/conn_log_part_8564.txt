Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 128, which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not a ping request (type 8). The second entry shows ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply as well, not a request. Since ping flood attacks require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 packets and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 packets in high volume to confirm no ping flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other protocol anomalies.  
- If suspicious traffic is detected later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
