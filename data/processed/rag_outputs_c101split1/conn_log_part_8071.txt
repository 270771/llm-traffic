Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0 respectively (fields 4 and 10 in Zeek conn.log represent ICMP type and code). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not represent ping requests and therefore cannot be part of a ping flood attack.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic for potential network issues or misconfigurations, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is evident.
