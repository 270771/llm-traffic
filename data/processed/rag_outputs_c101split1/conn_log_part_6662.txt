Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have a type field of 11 and 3 respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 and 3 messages often indicate network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable messages to ensure there are no underlying network misconfigurations or routing loops. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
