Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have the ICMP type field set to 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP traffic and no other suspicious indicators, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine their purpose, as ICMP type 0 corresponds to Echo Reply. Confirm if these are legitimate responses or part of another activity. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect future ping floods.
