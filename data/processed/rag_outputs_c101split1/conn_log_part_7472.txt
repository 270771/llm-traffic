Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (indicated by the "11" in the source port field, which in Zeek conn.log for ICMP is the ICMP type). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other types of attacks. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 traffic (Time Exceeded messages) to ensure it is not part of a traceroute or indicative of network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood.
