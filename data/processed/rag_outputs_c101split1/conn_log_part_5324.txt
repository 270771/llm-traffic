Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP records present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP type 8 floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are being captured elsewhere or if logging is incomplete.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN failures (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts worth further analysis.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods in the future.
