Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.0.178 to destination 35.59.65.99, with a single packet (count=1) and no signs of rapid or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The lack of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets excludes a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or other DoS attacks.
