Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field values of 3 and 1 (the 4th and 6th fields after source IP and destination IP are 3 and 1, respectively). ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood attack, but neither entry has type 8. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 corresponds to "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match ping flood criteria, no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are ICMP Destination Unreachable messages; this could indicate network misconfigurations or other connectivity issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood.  
- If other anomalies appear, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
