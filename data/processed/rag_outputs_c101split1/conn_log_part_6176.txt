Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1 or 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 and 1 traffic, which correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable messages, respectively.  
- Verify if these ICMP messages are part of normal network operations or indicative of other issues such as network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
