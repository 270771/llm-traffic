Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.249.88.129) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #3 (ICMP flood detection) in typical anomaly taxonomies, which flags excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source.  
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.249.88.129  
- Multiple destination IPs: 163.45.215.7, 163.45.183.53, 163.45.232.222, 163.45.214.243, 163.45.138.11, 163.45.232.234, 163.45.43.5, 163.45.203.253, 163.45.168.134, 163.45.17.80, 163.45.17.102, 163.45.53.59, 163.45.17.127, 163.45.127.118, 163.45.127.89, 163.45.165.7, 163.45.127.113, 163.45.23.26, 163.45.100.9, 163.45.165.6, 163.45.12.110  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.88.129 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts or other DoS vectors from this or related IPs.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools that can dynamically identify and throttle excessive ICMP traffic.  
5. Review and update network ACLs to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, especially from external sources.
