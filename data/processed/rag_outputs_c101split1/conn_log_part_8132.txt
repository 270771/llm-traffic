Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 11 and 10, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 10 and 11 correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., Router Advertisement, Time Exceeded), which do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 10 and 11 traffic to ensure it is legitimate network behavior (e.g., routing or diagnostic messages).  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would warrant immediate attention for potential ping flood attacks.
