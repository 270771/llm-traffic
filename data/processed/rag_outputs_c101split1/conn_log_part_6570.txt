Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive echo requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP echo reply, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks like smurf or ICMP flood.

Next steps: Investigate if there are corresponding echo request (type 8) packets in the logs to confirm normal ping activity or potential scanning. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests from the source IP 110.109.135.211 to 133.105.21.174.
