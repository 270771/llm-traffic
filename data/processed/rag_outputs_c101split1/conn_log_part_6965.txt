Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically involve ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the required pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP traffic and no anomalies flagged, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no network misconfigurations or scanning activities are causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any future ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood attempts.
