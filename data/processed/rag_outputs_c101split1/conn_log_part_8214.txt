Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.146.195.23) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~milliseconds). This pattern matches the classic ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.146.195.23 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs including 133.251.124.249, 133.251.115.224, 133.251.124.60, 133.251.125.68, 133.251.126.46, 133.251.114.12, 133.251.124.29, 133.251.127.166, 133.251.114.73, 133.251.125.193, 133.251.127.195, 133.251.114.75, 133.251.126.20, and 133.251.126.153. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are zero or not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.146.195.23 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts or other volumetric attacks.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if this is a recurring issue.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks in the future.
