Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Since no ICMP Echo Requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Investigate why there are ICMP Destination Unreachable and Echo Reply messagesâ€”these could indicate network issues or other benign ICMP activity but are not indicative of a ping flood attack. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP type 8 packets would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
