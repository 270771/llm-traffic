Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 7th column after source port) is 0 and 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood, these entries do not represent ping flood traffic.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable or other control messages) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential related attacks.
