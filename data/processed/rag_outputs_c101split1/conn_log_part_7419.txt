Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection but not necessarily malicious.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP echo request (type 8) packets in other logs or a high volume of ICMP traffic overall. Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP echo requests from the source IP 203.78.143.78 to 188.37.135.2 to rule out a developing ping flood.
