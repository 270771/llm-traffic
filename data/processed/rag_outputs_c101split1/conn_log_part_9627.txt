Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 34.17.112.111, from many different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013234). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-volume ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS taxonomies).  
- The taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flooding.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 34.17.112.111 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker IPs: 133.243.19.173, 133.243.207.208, 133.243.193.1, 133.243.243.72, 133.243.154.210, 133.243.169.211, 133.243.100.236, 133.243.182.46, 133.243.189.173, 133.243.211.6, 133.243.85.62, 133.243.211.46, 133.243.201.8, 133.243.154.217  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none are applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 34.17.112.111.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking IP addresses if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce impact.  
6. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
