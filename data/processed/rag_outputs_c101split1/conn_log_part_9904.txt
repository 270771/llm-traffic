Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from IP 3.241.1.60 targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x range, as well as from 35.211.173.188. The rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests to many different hosts within a very short time frame (all timestamps clustered around 1641013236) is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection, commonly assigned heuristic number **H1** (ICMP Flooding).  
- The taxonomy class is **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: 3.241.1.60 and 35.211.173.188  
- Destination IPs: Multiple within 163.45.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 163.45.216.253, 163.45.247.47, 163.45.253.33, etc.)  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 3.241.1.60 and 35.211.173.188.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and identify any collateral impact on internal hosts.  
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.  
6. Inform affected internal teams about potential service degradation and prepare mitigation communication plans.
