Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, but since the ICMP type is not 8, this is not indicative of a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection termination but is not sufficient to classify this as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.49.81 and destination IP 200.41.69.102 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, especially if multiple ICMP types are observed. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP echo requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
