Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- Heuristic for ping flood would require repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high volume.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 sending ICMP type 11 packets, which may indicate traceroute or other network diagnostic activity. Confirm if this traffic is expected or part of a different reconnaissance or network issue. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
