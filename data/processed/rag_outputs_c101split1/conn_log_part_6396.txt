Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8 in the Zeek conn.log snippet, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern shown (only two isolated ICMP connections) do not indicate a flood. A ping flood typically involves a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, causing network congestion or resource exhaustion. Here, the logs show only two separate ICMP connections with no indication of rapid or repeated requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP traffic volume anomalies.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs or targeting the same destination IPs. If such patterns emerge, further investigation and alerting should be triggered.
