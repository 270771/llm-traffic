Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.162.106, 157.206.53.15, 157.206.11.60, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination IP (3.199.185.249) within the same second (timestamp 1641013233).
- This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP type 8 packets rapidly to one target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern, where the target is overwhelmed by a flood of ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a heuristic for "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" attacks, typically classified under a Denial of Service (DoS) taxonomy.
- Assigning heuristic number: 101 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection in many frameworks).
- Taxonomy class: DoS/Disruption.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.206.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.206.162.106, 157.206.53.15, 157.206.11.60, etc.)
- Destination IP: 3.199.185.249
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.199.185.249.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
6. Ensure critical services on 3.199.185.249 have redundancy or failover to mitigate impact.
