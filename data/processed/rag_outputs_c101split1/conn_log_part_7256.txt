Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or if ICMP monitoring is enabled.
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Monitor for other TCP-based anomalies, such as SYN floods, since many TCP S0 (connection attempt without response) flags appear, which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts. This would fall under heuristic for TCP SYN flood or scanning, typically taxonomy class "Network Scan" or "DoS."

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is present in the provided data.
