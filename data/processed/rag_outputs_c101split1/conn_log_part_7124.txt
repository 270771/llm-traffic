Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 10 (likely a timestamp or other ICMP message), also not type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest other attack types.

Since no ping flood or other clear ICMP-based attack is detected, no immediate security response is required. However, further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs for potential reconnaissance or network scanning activities.

Without heuristics or taxonomy data, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
