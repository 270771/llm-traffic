Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 entry is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 163.45.61.247, but it appears as a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 8 traffic increases significantly or if other anomalies appear in future logs.  
- Consider correlating with network flow data or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP attacks.
