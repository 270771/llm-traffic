Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6).
- There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate ping activity.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets in high volume, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood is detected.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy data, the observed TCP SYN failures could align with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics (commonly heuristic #1 or #2 in many taxonomies).
- These represent network scanning or connection attempts rather than volumetric ICMP flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN failures for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
