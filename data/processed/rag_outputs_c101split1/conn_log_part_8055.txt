Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided. However, the ICMP code field is 0 in one entry and 1 in another, which does not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Verify the ICMP type field explicitly in future logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.250.202.133 sending ICMP code 1 (Destination Unreachable) to 165.185.59.91, which may indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency to detect potential ping floods.
