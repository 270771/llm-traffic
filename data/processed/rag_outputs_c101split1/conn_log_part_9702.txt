Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood attack. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 and destination IP 47.161.250.122 for any other suspicious activity or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other ICMP types that might indicate scanning or reconnaissance.
