Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot match known ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network captures to check for ICMP Echo Requests if ping flood is suspected.  
- Monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that could indicate a SYN flood or scanning activity, which would fall under heuristic classes related to TCP SYN anomalies.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to better classify suspicious traffic in future analyses.
