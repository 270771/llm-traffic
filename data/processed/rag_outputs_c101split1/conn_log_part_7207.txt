Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 183.204.158.107 to destination 133.251.110.72, but it appears as a single event with no evidence of high frequency or volume indicative of a flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP Echo Requests for volume spikes from 183.204.158.107 could be a prudent next step to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
