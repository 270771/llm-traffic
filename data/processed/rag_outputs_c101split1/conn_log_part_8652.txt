Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 3.241.1.60 to 163.45.192.120 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests that characterize a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other indicators of flooding, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time frame.  
- Investigate the source IP 3.241.1.60 if it generates a high volume of ICMP echo requests later.  
- Review network baseline to detect unusual ICMP traffic spikes.
