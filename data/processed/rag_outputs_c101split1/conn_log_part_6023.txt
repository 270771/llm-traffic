Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple hosts are sending ICMP Time Exceeded messages to the same destination IPs, as this could indicate network routing issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack. Monitoring for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates should continue to detect potential ping floods.
