Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but there is only a single packet per connection record and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The conn.log snippet shows isolated ICMP packets with no flood pattern such as multiple repeated requests or sustained traffic bursts.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate a known ping flood pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP within a short time frame to detect potential ping flood attempts. If volume increases significantly, investigate for possible ICMP flood or DoS activity.
