Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 1 traffic could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration rather than a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (202.125.201.9, 133.105.128.252) for potential network issues or scanning behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
