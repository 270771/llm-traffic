Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume shown is minimal (only single packets logged), and the connection state is OTH (other), indicating no established flow or sustained traffic. There is no evidence of repeated or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to multiple destinations or the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific label. Given the limited data, this traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
