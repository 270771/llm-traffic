Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs, which mostly show TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state) failing to establish connections, possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan or connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for possible ping floods in the future.
