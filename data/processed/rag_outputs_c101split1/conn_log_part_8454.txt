Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (54.249.1.129) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with rapid ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.1.129; Destination IPs include 163.45.129.204, 163.45.129.241, 163.45.129.224, 163.45.17.127, 163.45.131.180, 163.45.172.33, 163.45.66.14, 163.45.172.1, 163.45.131.67, 163.45.66.32, 163.45.66.0, 163.45.147.254, 163.45.9.77, 163.45.9.71, 163.45.189.189, 163.45.131.52, 163.45.189.161, 163.45.9.74, 163.45.189.178.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms Echo Request packets.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.1.129 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or new ICMP flood attempts from other sources.
- Notify affected network administrators of the targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on critical infrastructure.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed and coordinate with upstream providers or law enforcement if necessary.
