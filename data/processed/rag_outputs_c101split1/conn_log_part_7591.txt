Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack. The connection state `OTH` and flags do not indicate a flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP `112.169.93.57` and destination IP `202.250.223.146` for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP Time Exceeded messages, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
