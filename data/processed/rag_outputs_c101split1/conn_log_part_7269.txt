Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has a type field of 128 (the 7th field after source IP and port), which corresponds to ICMP type 128 (Echo Reply) or possibly another ICMP subtype, but it is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume from the same or other IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Also, monitor for other ICMP types that may indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service techniques.
