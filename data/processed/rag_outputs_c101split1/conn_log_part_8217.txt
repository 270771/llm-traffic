Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not a ping flood indicator. The second entry has ICMP type 8, but it is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping flood attacks correspond to heuristic categories involving ICMP Echo Request floods and taxonomy classes related to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If volume spikes or connection states indicate flooding (e.g., many OTH or REJ states with ICMP type 8), further investigation should be initiated. Also, correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts for DoS patterns.
