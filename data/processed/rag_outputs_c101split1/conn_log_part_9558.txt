Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (173.20.80.33) targeting multiple destination IPs (163.45.128.89 through 163.45.128.95) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The rapid succession of these echo requests within milliseconds strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-frequency ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies). The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 173.20.80.33  
- Target/destination IPs: 163.45.128.89, 163.45.128.90, 163.45.128.92, 163.45.128.93, 163.45.128.95  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 173.20.80.33 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods from this or other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls, such as ICMP rate limiting or blackholing traffic from suspicious IPs.  
5. Review logs for any collateral impact on the targeted hosts and ensure their availability and integrity.
