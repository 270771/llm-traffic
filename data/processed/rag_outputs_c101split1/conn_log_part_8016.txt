Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 107.102.62.64, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013222.18xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 107.102.62.64 (ICMP type 8, no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.4.94, 157.206.200.249, 157.206.80.7, 157.206.149.106, 157.206.234.254, and many others in the 157.206.x.x range.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 107.102.62.64.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
6. Ensure the target host has appropriate firewall rules to limit ICMP traffic and prevent resource exhaustion.
