Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.6.38 to destination 185.25.36.181, with a single connection record and a duration of 1.4 seconds. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets indicative of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or other DoS attacks. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts.
