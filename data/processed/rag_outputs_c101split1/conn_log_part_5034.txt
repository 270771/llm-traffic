Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without heuristic context, the default assumption is that no ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or if ICMP logging is disabled.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 state (connection attempts without completion) are visible, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance.
- Apply heuristics for SYN flood or port scanning if available, focusing on the high number of failed TCP connection attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood applies.
- The S0 state in Zeek conn.log typically corresponds to failed TCP connection attempts, which may be classified under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics if further context is provided.
