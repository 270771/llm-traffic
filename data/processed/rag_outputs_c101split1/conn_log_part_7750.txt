Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only one record shows ICMP type 8 (last entry: 203.78.143.78 â†’ 5.27.164.249), but it is a single event, not a flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (1 and 3) correspond to different message types (Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable), not ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high rates.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 for any unusual ICMP activity if it persists or increases.  
- Collect more data or enable rate-based alerts for ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
