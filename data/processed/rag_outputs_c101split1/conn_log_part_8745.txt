Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (130.187.192.39, 130.187.37.48, 130.187.26.185, etc.) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (3.17.238.136) in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send rapid echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 130.187.x.x range targeting 3.17.238.136. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs at the network perimeter firewall. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts and isolate them. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attacks. Notify network operations to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing traffic to 3.17.238.136 if service disruption persists.
