Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled in Zeek or other monitoring tools.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies or rate-based alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy references cannot be assigned due to lack of data.
