Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent to overwhelm a target.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it may be part of normal response traffic or a different benign ICMP exchange.

No attack is present. If further investigation is warranted, monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.143.78 or others, which could indicate a developing ping flood.
