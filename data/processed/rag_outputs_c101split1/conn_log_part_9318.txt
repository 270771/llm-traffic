Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not indicated here.
- The traffic mostly involves UDP port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP ports with SYN packets (S0 state), suggesting possible scanning or connection attempts but not ICMP flooding.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a denial-of-service ping flood.
- Typical heuristic for scanning would involve repeated connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state) without completion.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable deeper packet inspection or IDS rules focused on SIP anomalies and TCP SYN scans to confirm the nature of this activity.
