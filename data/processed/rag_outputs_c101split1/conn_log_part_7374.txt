Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal traffic volume, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.  
- If other ICMP types are involved, consider if they relate to other ICMP-based attacks or network issues.
