Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based diagnostics or errors.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If suspicious, correlate with other logs or alerts for possible reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other protocols.
