Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows traffic from 133.227.58.120 to 211.238.148.173 with ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8).  
- The second ICMP entry shows traffic from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.21.238 with ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, not an echo request.  
- Since neither entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), the traffic does not match the required pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure no routing or TTL issues are causing excessive ICMP errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
