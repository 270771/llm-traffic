Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present, this cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found.
- The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic context, the best classification for these entries is likely "TCP SYN scan" or "failed connection attempts," which typically fall under reconnaissance or scanning taxonomy.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connections for potential scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Apply heuristics for scanning detection once heuristic context is available.
