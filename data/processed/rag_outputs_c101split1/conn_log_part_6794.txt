Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.1.20 and destination 45.112.52.199 for unusual ICMP timestamp request patterns or other ICMP types that may indicate reconnaissance or timing attacks. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
