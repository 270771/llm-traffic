Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping requests.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore not part of a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and patterns continuously is recommended to detect any future anomalies.
