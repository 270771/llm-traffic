Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 118.116.244.150 to 163.45.129.89, which is a valid ping request.  
- The second and third entries have ICMP types 0 and 11, which are not type 8 and thus do not indicate ping flood traffic.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and patterns continuously is recommended to detect any future anomalies.
