Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.143.78 to 59.43.56.6 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic for ping flood detection involves high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to a target, which is not observed here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. Investigate if these hosts generate repeated echo requests over a short time frame to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
