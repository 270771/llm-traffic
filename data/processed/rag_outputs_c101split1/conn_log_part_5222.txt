Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The log entries have protocol field as "tcp" and no ICMP type or code fields are present. Therefore, no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures specifically for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies. Monitoring for high-rate ICMP echo requests from single or multiple sources would be necessary to confirm ping flood activity.
