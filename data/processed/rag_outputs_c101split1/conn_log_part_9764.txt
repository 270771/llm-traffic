Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, S0 states correspond to "Connection attempt failed" which may be related to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.* range) for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious traffic patterns.
