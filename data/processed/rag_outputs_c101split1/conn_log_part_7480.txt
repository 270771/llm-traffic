Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the Zeek conn.log snippet. The log shows ICMP traffic with state "OTH" (other), but without confirmation that the ICMP type is 8, it cannot be classified as a ping flood. Additionally, there is only a single connection record with a count of 1, which does not indicate the high volume of ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific classification.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type details in more granular logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from 5.131.34.101 to 202.101.173.94 to detect potential flooding patterns.
