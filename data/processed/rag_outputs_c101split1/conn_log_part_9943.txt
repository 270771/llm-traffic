Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP type code in the 4th and 6th fields (both are '3'), which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic is likely normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
