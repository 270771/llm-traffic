Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further context, this is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages between 202.125.201.18 and 211.83.187.47 to determine if there are network misconfigurations or other issues causing unreachable destinations. Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect any future ping flood attempts.
