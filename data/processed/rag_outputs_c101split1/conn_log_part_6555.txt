Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.152.29 to destination 8.3.201.9, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic. The other ICMP entries have types 13 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood or other suspicious ICMP flooding pattern is evident, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic with significant packet counts, which would indicate a ping flood. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP types if they appear in future logs.
