Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8, so it is a response, not an attack initiation.  
- There is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source targeting a victim, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 0 traffic is normal network behavior related to error messages and replies, not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any surge in ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from single or multiple sources to a target IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs show unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns.  
- If high ICMP Echo Request rates appear, apply known ping flood detection heuristics and taxonomy.
