Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic with the destination port as 0 and no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to verify ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.140.213 to the destination 80.78.78.118, which would be indicative of a ping flood.
