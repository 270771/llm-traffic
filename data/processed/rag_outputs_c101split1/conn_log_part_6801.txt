Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP packets originating from a single source IP (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013211.17-1641013211.19). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests sent to overwhelm target hosts.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.83.191.13; multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms Echo Request packets.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or other hosts.
- Investigate the source host 35.83.191.13 for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automatically detect and respond to similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
