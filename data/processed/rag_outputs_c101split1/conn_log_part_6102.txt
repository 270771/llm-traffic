Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic #1 often relates to volumetric ICMP attacks, and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" would apply to ping floods, but these do not apply here due to lack of ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to determine if these attempts are part of a broader attack pattern. Also, monitor for any ICMP traffic that may appear subsequently.
