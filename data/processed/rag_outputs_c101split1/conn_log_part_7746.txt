Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.108, but there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages correspond to network issues or misconfigurations.
