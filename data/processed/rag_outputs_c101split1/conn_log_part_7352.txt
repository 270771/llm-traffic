Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 202.244.71.199 to destination 23.151.175.89, with a single packet (count=0, orig_pkts=0, resp_pkts=0, orig_ip_bytes=0). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of volume and absence of type 8 floods, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.244.71.199 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse.
