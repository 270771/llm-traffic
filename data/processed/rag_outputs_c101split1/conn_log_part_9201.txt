Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP record shows type 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood. The second record shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it has zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic or flooding activity.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no excessive ICMP Echo Request traffic is present, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the involved IPs (133.227.71.251 and 3.23.69.72) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the first recordâ€™s ICMP type 1 traffic for possible network issues or misconfigurations, as ICMP Destination Unreachable messages can indicate routing or firewall problems.
