Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 8 from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.28, but it is a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other two entries are ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 messages for possible network misconfigurations or other issues causing unreachable destinations.
