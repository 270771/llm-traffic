Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields (source port 11, destination port 0). ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but here the destination port is 0, which does not match type 8. Therefore, this traffic is not an ICMP Echo Request and does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but is not sufficient to label an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP traffic with type other than 8 to determine if it corresponds to other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP traffic from 133.227.58.120 to 91.58.217.62 for potential anomalies.
