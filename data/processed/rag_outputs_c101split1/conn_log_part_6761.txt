Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.98.68, 133.243.84.185, 133.243.56.125, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.227.90.79 in rapid succession. This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in the 133.243.x.x range targeting 54.227.90.79. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/type.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for further escalation or related attack vectors.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled and logged for forensic analysis.
