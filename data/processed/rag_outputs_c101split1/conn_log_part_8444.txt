Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows types 128 and 3, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood. Type 128 corresponds to ICMP Echo Reply (IPv6), and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if this traffic were to be investigated further, the presence of ICMP Destination Unreachable (type 3) might suggest network scanning or misconfiguration issues rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.243.115.209 sending ICMP type 3 messages for potential network issues or scanning behavior.  
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to correlate with other suspicious activity.
