Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP type codes 3 and 128 (fields 4 and 10 correspond to ICMP type/code; type 8 is Echo Request, which is required for ping floods). Since neither entry has ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 typically indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 128 is an ICMPv6 Echo Request, which alone does not indicate flooding without volume or rate anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMPv6 Echo Requests (type 128) to rule out potential ICMPv6 scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets at high rates from the same source IPs to detect possible future ping floods.
