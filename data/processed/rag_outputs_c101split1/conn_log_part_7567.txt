Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 traffic between 202.250.216.227 and 59.17.100.73 to determine if it is legitimate network behavior or part of a reconnaissance or timing attack. Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP messages that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks.
