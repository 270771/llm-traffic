Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings). However, the volume and timing of these requests do not indicate a flood pattern. The entries from source IP 54.251.127.36 to multiple destination IPs show single ICMP echo requests spaced within milliseconds, but there is no evidence of rapid, repeated, high-volume ICMP echo requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP echo requests occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Additionally, investigate the source IP 54.251.127.36 for any unusual activity patterns or reputation issues.
