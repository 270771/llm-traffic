Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.146.195.23) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 133.105.x.x subnet. The rapid succession of these echo requests with very low inter-arrival times (~0.0018 to 0.0026 seconds) matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target network with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP echo request flood," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.146.195.23; Destination IPs include 133.105.128.1, 133.105.128.252, 133.105.129.1, 133.105.129.5, 133.105.135.243, 133.105.138.220, among others. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.146.195.23 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
  3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
  5. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IP range to coordinate mitigation if needed.
