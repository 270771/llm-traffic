Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with flags like S0 (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or volumetric ICMP attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" would apply to ping floods, but these do not apply here due to lack of ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging in Zeek or other IDS tools to ensure ICMP packets are monitored.  
- Monitor for other signs of scanning or reconnaissance given the many TCP SYN attempts.
