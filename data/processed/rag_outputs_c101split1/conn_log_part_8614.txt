Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- Only one record shows ICMP type 8: the third entry (13.24.252.2 â†’ 202.250.202.171). However, it is a single connection with a low packet count (56 bytes, 1 packet), not a flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods.  

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match other attack patterns such as ICMP unreachable or time exceeded floods, as volume and frequency are low.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or multiple simultaneous ICMP Echo Requests.
