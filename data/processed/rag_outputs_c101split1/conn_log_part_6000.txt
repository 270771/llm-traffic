Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 88.232.8.253, with a single packet and a short duration (0.099538 seconds). The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The observed ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages may indicate normal network error conditions rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood attacks. Also, review network error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other underlying issues.
