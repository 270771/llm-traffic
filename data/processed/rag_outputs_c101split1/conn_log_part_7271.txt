Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns that rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. However, ICMP type 3 messages can indicate network issues or scanning activity and may warrant further investigation into the source IP 203.78.143.78 for potential reconnaissance behavior.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or high-volume ICMP traffic from this or other IPs to detect possible ping floods. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for related ICMP error messages to assess network health.
