Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.196.70.79) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013226.xxx). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack under the taxonomy class "Network Flooding" or "ICMP Flood."  
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High volume ICMP Echo Requests)  
- Taxonomy class: Network Flooding / ICMP Flood

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.196.70.79 (ICMP does not use ports)  
- Source IPs: Multiple distinct IPs in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.241.215, 133.243.116.253, 133.243.241.212, etc.)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.196.70.79.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting the same host.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.
