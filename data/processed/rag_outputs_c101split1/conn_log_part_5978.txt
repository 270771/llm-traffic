Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The observed ICMP types correspond to:
- Type 11: Time Exceeded (often related to traceroute or routing issues)
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable (indicates unreachable hosts or ports)

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest these are part of a different attack. However, these ICMP messages could indicate network troubleshooting or misconfigurations rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.140.213 and 202.125.201.18) for unusual activity or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate scanning or reconnaissance. Monitor for any escalation to suspicious traffic patterns.
