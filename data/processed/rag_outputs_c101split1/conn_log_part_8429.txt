Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). The second entry has ICMP type 11, which is a time exceeded message and not related to ping floods. However, there is only a single ICMP echo request record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate.  
- Investigate if any other logs or network monitoring tools indicate unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If ICMP traffic volume increases significantly, apply heuristics related to volumetric ICMP attacks and classify under taxonomy class "Denial of Service" or "Network Flooding."
