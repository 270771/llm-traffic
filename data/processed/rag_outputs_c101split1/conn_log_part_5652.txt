Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple connection attempts primarily over TCP and UDP protocols. There are no entries indicating ICMP traffic, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The protocol column shows only TCP (6) and UDP (17) traffic, with no ICMP (1) entries present.

Since no ICMP Echo Requests are observed, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN attempts without completion (S0 state), which could suggest scanning or reconnaissance activity, but this is not a flooding attack.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- No explicit heuristics or taxonomy classes are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.  
- Typically, SYN scan or reconnaissance would fall under heuristic categories related to scanning or probing, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) from IPs such as 89.247.69.146 on port 8080, which may indicate scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP monitoring to detect potential ping floods in the future.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection attempts.
