Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs or repeated connection failures.
