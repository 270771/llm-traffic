Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, there is no evidence of ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies or other suspicious traffic patterns.
