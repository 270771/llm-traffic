Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood attack. Since the traffic does not contain ICMP type 8 packets, it does not match the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The ICMP Echo Reply traffic observed here is normal response traffic.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in other logs to confirm the absence of ping flood attempts. Monitor for unusually high ICMP Echo Request rates from the source IP 133.243.6.38 or to the destination 87.254.131.252.
