Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP types 13 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to "Timestamp Request" (type 13) and "Echo Reply" (type 0), which may indicate normal or other diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of the ICMP Timestamp Requests and Echo Replies between these hosts to ensure they are legitimate. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual traffic volume that could indicate emerging threats.
