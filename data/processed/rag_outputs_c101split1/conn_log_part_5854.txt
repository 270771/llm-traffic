Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 13 is typically benign or used for network diagnostics, no immediate attack is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 13 messages that could indicate reconnaissance or other scanning activity, but no direct evidence of a ping flood is present.
