Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, 11, and 3 again. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 record (from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.246.23) but no evidence of high volume or repeated echo requests indicative of flooding.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 8 alone without volume or repetition does not meet criteria for ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination over a short time frame.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for possible network issues or other attack types such as reconnaissance or misconfiguration.
