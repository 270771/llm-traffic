Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1, 3, or 129 (field 4 and 6 represent ICMP type and code). None have ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. The traffic shows other ICMP types such as destination unreachable (type 3) or echo reply (type 129), which do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, since no ping flood is detected, no related heuristic applies.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) is recommended to detect future ping floods promptly.
