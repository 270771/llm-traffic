Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type fields as "3" or "128/129" (for IPv6), which correspond to Destination Unreachable (type 3) and ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply (types 128/129). The critical ICMP type for a ping flood is type 8 (Echo Request). Since none of the entries have ICMP type 8, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messages or echo replies, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume of ICMP error messages (type 3) is unusually high, which could indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based attacks. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or abnormal ICMP traffic patterns.
