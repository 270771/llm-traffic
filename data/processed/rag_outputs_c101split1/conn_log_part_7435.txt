Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 4, which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type 4 corresponds to "Source Quench," which is unrelated to ping floods. No anomalies or heuristics are indicated in the provided data.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection record. Without heuristic context or anomaly records, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Investigate if multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.227.58.122) to the destination (88.202.197.227) appear over a short time frame to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
