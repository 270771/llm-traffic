Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not indicated here.
- The traffic shows multiple UDP attempts on port 5060 (commonly SIP) and various TCP SYN attempts, but these do not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The observed traffic may indicate scanning or reconnaissance attempts (e.g., UDP on SIP ports), but this is not a ping flood.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 for potential SIP scanning or abuse.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request floods in future logs to detect ping floods.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture relevant ICMP type 8 traffic.
