Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No continuous or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, and type 0 is a normal echo reply, neither indicating flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for comprehensive analysis.
