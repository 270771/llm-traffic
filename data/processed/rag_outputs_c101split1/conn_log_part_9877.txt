Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 35.72.129.52.
- These requests originate from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013236.09xxxx), indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests flooding the target.
- This pattern matches the classic ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP echo requests to degrade or deny service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is not applicable)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including but not limited to 133.243.113.195, 133.243.254.20, 133.243.113.136, 133.243.109.206, 133.243.109.15, 133.243.137.135, 133.243.201.216, 133.243.131.218, 133.243.201.146, 133.243.121.191, 133.243.18.129, 133.243.71.2, 133.243.97.23, 153.131.212.228.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 35.72.129.52.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and potentially block or quarantine the attacking source IPs.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs if attack traffic is volumetric and beyond local mitigation capabilities.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential denial of service impact.
