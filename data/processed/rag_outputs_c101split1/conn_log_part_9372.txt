Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood.  
- The second entry is ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods as per the given rule.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or volume consistent with a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- The presence of ICMP type 1 traffic may warrant investigation for network issues or misconfigurations but does not indicate an attack.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.194.249 sending ICMP type 1 messages to ensure network health and proper routing.
