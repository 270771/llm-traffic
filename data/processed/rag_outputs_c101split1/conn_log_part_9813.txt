Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 1, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates ping requests, and thus potential ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 is "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are error messages, not echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (203.78.135.66 and 203.78.137.66) for possible misconfigurations or other suspicious behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual traffic volume that could indicate evolving threats.
