Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from two source IPs (13.24.252.2 and 172.23.68.231) targeting different destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request packets (ping). The rapid succession of these packets within milliseconds strongly indicates a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is:  
- **Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request traffic from a single source to multiple destinations**  
- **Taxonomy class: Network DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**

Involved IP addresses and ports:  
- Sources: 13.24.252.2, 172.23.68.231  
- Destinations: 202.250.192.9, 202.250.202.133, 202.250.192.2, 202.250.245.255  
- ICMP does not use ports, so none apply.

Recommended security response plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (13.24.252.2 and 172.23.68.231) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity from these or other sources.  
3. Investigate the source hosts for possible compromise or misuse.  
4. Inform network operations to prepare for potential collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
