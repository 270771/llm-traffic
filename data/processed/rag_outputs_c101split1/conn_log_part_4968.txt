Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connection attempts (not ICMP), and no ICMP traffic is present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. The traffic appears to be a series of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs generating numerous failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
