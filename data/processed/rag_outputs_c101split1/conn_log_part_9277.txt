Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection state is "OTH" (other), and there is only a single packet per connection (last field = 1), indicating no high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. There is no evidence of sustained or excessive ICMP traffic from these entries.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the lack of volume and anomaly data, this traffic does not match a ping flood or any other clear attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs. If multiple rapid ICMP requests are observed, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify unusual spikes in ICMP traffic.
