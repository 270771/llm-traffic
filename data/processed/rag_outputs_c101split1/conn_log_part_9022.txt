Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.74.222) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013230.85). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.56.117, 133.243.121.191, 133.243.240.254, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.202.74.222. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 44.202.74.222.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs if possible, and coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns automatically.
  5. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
