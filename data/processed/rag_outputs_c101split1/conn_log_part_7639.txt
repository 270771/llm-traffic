Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from IP 151.105.96.5 to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.214 and 133.105.230.215). However, the volume and timing of these packets do not indicate a flood pattern. The other ICMP entry with type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source targeting one or multiple destinations in a way that would constitute a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify abnormal ICMP patterns.
