Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
Multiple ICMP connections show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent from various source IPs (e.g., 157.206.206.197, 157.206.197.166, 151.105.96.5, 157.206.202.224, 157.206.227.120, 157.206.195.131) targeting a small set of destination IPs (e.g., 174.95.41.114, 3.196.199.185, 133.105.230.38/39). The rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to the same destinations is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is:  
- Heuristic #1: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a target, indicating a ping flood.  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:  
- Sources: 157.206.206.197, 157.206.197.166, 151.105.96.5, 157.206.202.224, 157.206.227.120, 157.206.195.131  
- Destinations: 174.95.41.114, 3.196.199.185, 133.105.230.38, 133.105.230.39  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at network perimeter devices targeting the victim IPs.  
2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and adjust mitigation accordingly.  
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from identified attacker IPs temporarily to protect critical assets.
