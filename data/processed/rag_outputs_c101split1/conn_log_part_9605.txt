Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- Specifically, there are no records with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The UDP entries (with protocol number 17) do not specify ICMP types and appear to be standard UDP traffic, not ICMP Echo Requests.  
- TCP entries show SYN attempts (S0 state) but no flooding pattern related to ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs on port 5060, as repeated UDP packets could indicate other types of UDP-based attacks (e.g., UDP flood or SIP-related scanning).  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Monitor TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or SYN flood attacks, as many S0 states are present.

In summary, no ping flood is detected; further investigation should focus on unusual UDP traffic patterns and TCP SYN attempts.
