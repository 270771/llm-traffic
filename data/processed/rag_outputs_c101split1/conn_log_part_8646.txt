Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 8, 11, 3, and 3. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic can indicate a ping flood. Here, the only ICMP type 8 entry is from source IP 47.227.223.84 to destination 202.250.216.32, but it appears as a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high-volume traffic means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 8 traffic from 47.227.223.84 to 202.250.216.32 for volume and frequency over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate ping attempts.  
- Monitor ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based issues unrelated to ping floods.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" for denial-of-service or reconnaissance activities.
