Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping requests. However, there is only a single packet recorded (count=1), not a flood or high volume of ICMP Echo Requests. The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would require a large volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IPs (222.175.165.149 and 163.45.66.47).  
- Investigate the source IP 222.175.165.149 sending ICMP Echo Requests to 202.250.236.67 for any unusual patterns.  
- Check for other signs of network scanning or reconnaissance, as ICMP type 3 messages may indicate network issues or filtering.

No immediate security response is required based on this data.
