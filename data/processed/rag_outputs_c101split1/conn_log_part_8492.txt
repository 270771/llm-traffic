Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet in the snippet is from 203.78.143.78 to 1.128.58.60 with a single packet (count 96 bytes, duration ~26s), which does not indicate a flood.  
- Other ICMP packets have types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not ping requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets is observed, which is characteristic of ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. No other attack patterns are evident from the data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests to a single target.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
