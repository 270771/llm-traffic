Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 11 packets that could indicate network misconfiguration or a different form of reconnaissance, but no immediate attack is evident here.
