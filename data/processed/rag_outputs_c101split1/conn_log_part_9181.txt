Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.
- The traffic mostly involves UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connections with SYN packets but no signs of flooding or excessive ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. However, the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154 to multiple IPs could warrant further investigation for potential SIP scanning or enumeration activity.

Next steps:
- Monitor UDP port 5060 traffic for unusual volume or patterns.
- Collect ICMP traffic logs to verify if any ICMP echo requests occur.
- Implement alerting on ICMP type 8 floods if ICMP traffic is observed in future logs.
