Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 1 or 3, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

The observed ICMP types (1 = Destination Unreachable, 3 = Source Quench or other control messages) indicate control or error messages rather than ping requests. This suggests no ping flood but possibly normal network error or control traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if further investigation is warranted, focus should be on the high volume of ICMP type 3 messages from IP 203.78.137.66, which may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume from these IPs. Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no underlying network problems.
