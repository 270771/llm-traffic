Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry in the Zeek conn.log snippet is from source IP 142.41.98.131 to destination 202.250.249.246 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is a ping. However, there is only a single ICMP connection record with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a flood. All other entries are TCP or UDP connections with no ICMP traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not observed here.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP Echo Requests from the same or multiple IPs over a short period. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network traffic for other types of DoS or scanning activity given the many TCP SYN failures (S0 flags) visible, which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
