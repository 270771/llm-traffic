Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP Echo Request flooding.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood DoS attacks. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic on network devices.
