Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.58, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping floods. There is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 3 and 13 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Timestamp, respectively, which may indicate network issues or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 for any unusual ICMP Echo Request activity over a longer time window. Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates or other suspicious patterns. Also, review network device logs for ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to rule out misconfigurations or other network problems.
