Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior related to ICMP traffic.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that these ICMP messages are normal network control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
