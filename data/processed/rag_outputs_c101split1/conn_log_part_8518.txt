Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The connection states (mostly S0, indicating SYN packets without completion) suggest scanning or failed connection attempts, not ICMP flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic context or taxonomy is provided, no specific classification can be assigned.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or port scanning activity (many SYN attempts with no completion).

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no handshake completion for potential scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further anomaly detection on these IPs and ports.
