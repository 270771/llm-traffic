Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log primarily logs TCP/UDP connections.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for other suspicious patterns such as SYN floods or port scans, which might be indicated by the numerous TCP connection attempts with S0 state (SYN sent, no response). These could correspond to reconnaissance or DoS attempts unrelated to ping floods.
