Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the "0" in the source port field, which for ICMP represents the type), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP type 0 packets (Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of a reflection attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
