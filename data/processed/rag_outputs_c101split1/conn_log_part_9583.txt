Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping requests.
- The source IP 54.254.197.94 is sending a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.013 seconds per connection), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Other source IPs (e.g., 173.20.80.35) also send ICMP type 8 packets but at a lower volume.
- The rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets indicate an attempt to overwhelm the network or hosts, matching known ping flood attack behavior.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.
- Taxonomy class: **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attacker IP: 54.254.197.94 (source port 8, ICMP Echo Request)
- Victim IPs: Multiple 163.45.x.x addresses (e.g., 163.45.221.10, 163.45.254.102, 163.45.49.151, etc.)
- Other sources: 173.20.80.35 also sending ICMP type 8 packets but less aggressively.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 54.254.197.94.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or new sources of ICMP flooding.
- Notify affected network owners of the victim IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the attacker IP if it is external and not part of legitimate traffic.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
