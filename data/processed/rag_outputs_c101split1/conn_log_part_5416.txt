Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic mostly shows TCP SYN scans or connection attempts (S0 states), which could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods. Implement network monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests to detect any future ping flood attempts.
