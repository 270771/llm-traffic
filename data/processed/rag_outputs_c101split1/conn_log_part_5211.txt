Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP packets are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state further, as this may indicate port scanning or other reconnaissance behavior. Apply heuristics related to scanning (e.g., multiple failed TCP connection attempts) and monitor for potential lateral movement or exploitation attempts.
