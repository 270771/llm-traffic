Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 44.195.45.212, from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013223.57). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 44.195.45.212 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.227.135.44, 133.227.205.11, 133.227.135.208, 133.227.210.244, 133.227.205.2, 133.227.210.254, 133.227.224.2, 133.227.224.1, 133.227.75.1, 133.227.211.11, 133.227.211.5, 133.227.211.1, 133.227.135.227, 133.227.221.11, and others.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 44.195.45.212.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.  
6. Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and apply appropriate blocking or remediation.
