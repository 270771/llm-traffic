Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows two entries with ICMP types 128 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

- The first entry has ICMP type 128, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not a request.
- The second entry has ICMP type 3, which indicates a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. If further investigation is warranted, focus should be on monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or other unusual ICMP message patterns.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden increase in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP error messages that could indicate other network issues or attacks.
