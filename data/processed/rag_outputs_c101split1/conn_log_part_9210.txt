Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP connections from 45.121.95.154 to various destination IPs on port 5060, but these are UDP flows, not ICMP.
- There is no indication of ICMP traffic in the logs, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.
- The connections mostly show S0 (connection attempt without response) states on UDP and TCP ports, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, typical heuristics for ping flood would require ICMP type 8 traffic and high packet rates.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or a UDP flood attack.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for repeated failed connection attempts (S0 states) that could indicate reconnaissance or other DoS attack types.
