Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection states.  
- If anomalies appear, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving thresholds on packet rate and volume.
