Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 1 (ICMP Host Unreachable or Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP Echo Request (ping) and thus for a ping flood attack. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy, ICMP type 3 and 1 messages are typically related to network errors or responses, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (157.206.116.186 and 133.243.154.254) for potential network misconfigurations or scanning activity, as ICMP type 3 messages can indicate unreachable hosts or ports.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
