Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 130.187.20.19, 130.187.46.249, 130.187.18.189, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (54.129.195.3) within the same second (timestamp 1641013234). This pattern of many sources simultaneously sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 130.187.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.129.195.3. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.129.195.3.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to broader DDoS mitigation services if attack volume increases.
