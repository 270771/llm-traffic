Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP packets in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 11 and 8, but none have ICMP type 8 as the request type for echo request (ping). Specifically, the first record shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), but the others are type 11 (time exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood. However, the first recordâ€™s ICMP type 8 packet count is low and isolated, not showing the high volume or rapid repetition characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 119.114.146.72 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 203.78.149.37 for potential benign or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume or patterns consistent with flooding.
