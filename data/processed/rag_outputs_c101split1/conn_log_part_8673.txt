Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 44.202.236.101.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct, sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession (timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 44.202.236.101 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.114.6, 133.243.136.226, 133.243.123.255, 133.243.113.5, 133.243.107.15, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 44.202.236.101.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP traffic patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate.
4. Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo responses on the target host if operationally feasible.
