Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 44.198.161.223 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps around 1641013226). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-volume ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies).  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 44.198.161.223 (receiving the flood)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.171.93, 157.206.171.216, 157.206.100.207, 157.206.73.213, 157.206.112.156, 157.206.126.129, 157.206.153.34, 157.206.75.65, 157.206.133.209, 157.206.51.173, 157.206.239.51, 157.206.51.175, 157.206.153.249, 157.206.126.240, 157.206.8.203, and others.  
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.198.161.223.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
