Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, there is only a single such event recorded, not a flood or high volume of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. If such patterns emerge, investigate source IP behavior and volume thresholds.
