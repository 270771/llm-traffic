Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single target IP (54.203.14.148) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013210.49).
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records or heuristic context requires assigning a default heuristic and taxonomy:
  - Heuristic: High-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination.
  - Taxonomy: Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Target IP: 54.203.14.148 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.206.201.249, 157.206.232.147, 157.206.255.13, etc.)
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.203.14.148.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation service to filter malicious traffic before it reaches the network.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if not required for legitimate operations.
