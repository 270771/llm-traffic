Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.197.247.113, from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013230.34x). This pattern—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single destination."  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.197.247.113 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.201.231, 157.206.228.252, 157.206.168.246, 157.206.121.235, 157.206.125.238, 157.206.50.77, 157.206.113.35, 157.206.168.130, 157.206.146.29, 157.206.156.17, 157.206.237.141, 157.206.153.2, 157.206.121.224, and others.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.197.247.113.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other related anomalies.  
5. Consider deploying blackhole routing or scrubbing services if the attack volume escalates.
