Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the absence of ICMP traffic strongly indicates no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high number of SYN packets with no completion (S0) for possible TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any ICMP-based anomalies.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning (e.g., heuristic for SYN flood or port scanning) once anomaly data is available.
