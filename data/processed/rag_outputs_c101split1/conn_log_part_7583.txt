Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods. However, the entries with type 8 are isolated and do not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The other ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack heuristic.

Next steps: Monitor for a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window. If such a pattern emerges, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
