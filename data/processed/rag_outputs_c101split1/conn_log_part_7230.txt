Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 133.243.126.189 to 139.76.135.5 with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic from 122.26.190.52 to 202.101.172.72 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet is logged, insufficient to indicate flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 8 traffic alone does not confirm an attack without volume or pattern evidence.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if any hosts show unusually high ICMP echo request rates over time.  
- Collect anomaly data and apply heuristics once available to detect potential ping floods.
