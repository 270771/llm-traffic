Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," neither of which are associated with ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types were to be considered suspicious, they might relate to network misconfigurations or reconnaissance rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.142.10 and 133.105.143.0) for unusual ICMP activity or other anomalies, but no immediate ping flood response is required.
