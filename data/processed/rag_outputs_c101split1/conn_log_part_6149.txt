Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 8. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are not related to ping floods. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8, which is an Echo Request (ping), but it is a single instance and not indicative of flooding. There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 traffic may warrant investigation for network issues or scanning activity, but it is not a DoS attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 sending ICMP type 8 to 133.105.148.78 for any unusual behavior.  
- Review network logs for any other signs of scanning or reconnaissance related to ICMP type 3 messages.
