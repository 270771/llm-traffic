Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the entries with ICMP type 8 are isolated and low volume (two packets from 18.72.141.69 to two different IPs). There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting one or multiple destinations, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of high-frequency ICMP echo requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 18.72.141.69 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- If other anomalies arise, apply relevant heuristics once available.
