Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP packets with various types. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, these occur at normal intervals and low volume (two packets within the same second from 203.78.142.95 to different destinations). The other ICMP types (1, 3) represent error messages or unreachable notifications, not ping requests. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The absence of a flood pattern means no immediate attack classification applies.

Next steps: Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from single sources to single destinations. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or denial-of-service activity.
