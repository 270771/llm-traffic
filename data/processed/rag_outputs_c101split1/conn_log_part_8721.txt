Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is necessary for ping floods, but the connection states are "OTH" (other) with very low packet counts (0 and 1 packets), indicating no sustained or high-volume ICMP traffic typical of a ping flood. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the low volume and lack of repeated traffic, this traffic does not match known attack patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from these IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets is observed, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
