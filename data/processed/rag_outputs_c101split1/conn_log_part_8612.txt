Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 1 (Destination Unreachable - Host Unreachable), also not type 8.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood but rather normal ICMP error messages. These could be investigated further for network reachability issues but do not represent an attack.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and context.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these IPs.  
- Investigate network connectivity or routing issues causing ICMP type 3 and 1 messages.
