Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.227.200.232 to destination 54.235.234.82, but there is only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0, 1, or 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" and flags do not indicate a known attack pattern here.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP at a high rate to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern by correlating with additional logs or network flow data.
