Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `133.243.206.29` to `104.69.31.249` with a single record and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types other than 8 (e.g., type 0, 3, 13), which do not correspond to ping flood traffic. The traffic volume and timing do not show the burst or sustained flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. The observed ICMP traffic appears normal or related to other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, timestamp requests).

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP `133.243.206.29` if it sends multiple echo requests over time.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP echo request rates exceeding normal thresholds to detect potential future ping floods.
