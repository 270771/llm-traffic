Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The absence of ICMP traffic suggests no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is occurring.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks indicated by the TCP SYN packets with S0 flags (connection attempts without response), which may suggest scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning or connection failures once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
