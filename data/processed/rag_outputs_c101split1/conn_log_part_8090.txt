Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (indicated by the destination port field being `0` and no explicit ICMP type 8 shown), which is not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 packets constitute ping floods, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
