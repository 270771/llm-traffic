Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). There is a single record with ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641013203.438416), but it shows only one packet with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no excessive ICMP echo requests are observed, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns, which require a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packet rate from the involved IPs (180.160.93.46 to 203.78.135.92).  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or misconfigurations, as these indicate unreachable destinations and TTL expirations.  
- Establish heuristics to detect abnormal ICMP echo request rates for future detection.
