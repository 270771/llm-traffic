Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged, no ping flood is detected. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is matched.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts for potential scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious connection attempts.
