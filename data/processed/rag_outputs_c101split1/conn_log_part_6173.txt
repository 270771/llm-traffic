Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry from 133.227.58.122 to 167.56.152.231 shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP entry from 203.78.143.78 to 125.96.101.244 shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single connection is logged with a duration of ~2.3 seconds and no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from 203.78.143.78 increase in frequency or volume over time to rule out slow or low-rate ping floods.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests with short intervals from the same source IP.  
- If volume spikes, apply heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Network DoS" as standard for ping floods.
