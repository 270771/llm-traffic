Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field as `0` (the 7th field after source port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic could represent other ICMP message types (e.g., Echo Reply or other control messages), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 0 messages to confirm they are legitimate Echo Replies or other benign ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If unusual ICMP traffic patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
