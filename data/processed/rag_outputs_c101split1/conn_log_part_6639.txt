Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scans or connection attempts if available.
