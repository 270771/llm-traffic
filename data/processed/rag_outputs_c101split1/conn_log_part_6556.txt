Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). The second entry has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message and not related to ping floods. However, there is only one ICMP Echo Request recorded, and no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets that would indicate a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood would be characterized by a large number of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a short time frame from one or multiple sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) or others.  
- Monitor for spikes in ICMP traffic volume to detect potential flooding.  
- Review firewall or IDS alerts for ICMP anomalies.
