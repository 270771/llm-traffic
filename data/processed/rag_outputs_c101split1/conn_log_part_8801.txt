Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it may be part of normal response traffic or a follow-up to legitimate pings.

No attack is present here. Further investigation could include monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 176.8.225.49 to the destination 203.78.135.92 to detect potential future ping floods.
