Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown in the conn.log snippet, but the presence of ICMP traffic alone does not confirm a ping flood. The conn.log entry shows a single ICMP connection with state "OTH" (other), and no evidence of repeated ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets or high volume traffic typical of a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no anomaly data or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned. The connection appears to be a single ICMP exchange, which may be normal network activity or a different ICMP type.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP packet types and volume over time to detect potential flooding patterns. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 5.131.34.101 to the destination 202.101.173.102.
