Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP (69.232.166.26) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The rapid succession of these requests from multiple distinct source IPs (133.243.89.220, 133.243.172.187, 133.243.136.244, 133.243.112.226, 133.243.247.122, 133.243.26.13, 133.243.120.251) strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests to a single target**. The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Target IP: 69.232.166.26 (ICMP type 8, no ports)  
- Source IPs: 133.243.89.220, 133.243.172.187, 133.243.136.244, 133.243.112.226, 133.243.247.122, 133.243.26.13, 133.243.120.251

Recommended security response plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor the target hostâ€™s network and system performance for signs of resource exhaustion or service degradation.  
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.  
6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target if business operations allow.
