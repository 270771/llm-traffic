Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is the 4th column after the source IP (e.g., `8` in `203.78.143.78 8 62.184.135.1`), which corresponds to the ICMP type. Here, the first two entries have ICMP type 8, which is Echo Request (ping). However, the third entry has ICMP type 11, which is Time Exceeded, not related to ping floods.  
- The volume and timing of the ICMP Echo Requests do not indicate a flood. The packets are sparse and do not show rapid repeated requests from one source to one destination.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. The ICMP type 11 packet could be part of normal network diagnostics or traceroute activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any unusual behavior if other logs or alerts arise.
