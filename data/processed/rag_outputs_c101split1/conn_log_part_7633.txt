Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume shown is minimal (only single packets per connection), and there is no indication of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one source to multiple destinations or vice versa, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The connections are marked as OTH (other), with no retransmissions or high packet counts.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific label. Given the data, this traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to multiple destinations, which could indicate the start of a ping flood. Also, review network baseline traffic patterns to detect any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
