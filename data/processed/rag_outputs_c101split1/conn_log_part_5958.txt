Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column (after source IP and before destination IP). The entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are:

- 203.78.143.78 → 121.143.193.162 (ICMP type 8)  
- 128.149.158.11 → 163.45.223.40 (ICMP type 8)

However, there are only two such entries, and the timestamps do not indicate a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entries have types 3, 0, or 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Given the low volume and lack of sustained ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge of ICMP Echo Requests occurs, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages for potential network issues or other attack vectors.
