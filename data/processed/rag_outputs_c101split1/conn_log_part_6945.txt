Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (echo request) is from source IP 143.5.202.233 to destination 163.45.109.221, but it shows a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entry has type 3, which is not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of multiple rapid ICMP echo requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP in a short time frame to detect potential flooding. Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
