Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.223.127.239) from numerous distinct source IPs within the same timestamp (1641013231.37). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target—is a classic indicator of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 52.223.127.239 (ICMP type 8, no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.187.46, 133.243.169.145, 133.243.187.176, 133.243.67.1, 133.243.239.80, 133.243.187.111, 133.243.224.22, 133.243.160.21, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.223.127.239.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other DoS vectors.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
