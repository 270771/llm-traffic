Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the connection state is "OTH" (other), and there is only a single recorded connection with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the source IP 133.243.206.29 to the destination 104.127.50.7. A ping flood attack typically involves a large volume of ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate a known attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this or other IPs. If multiple rapid ICMP echo requests are detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Additionally, investigate the "OTH" connection state to understand the nature of this traffic.
