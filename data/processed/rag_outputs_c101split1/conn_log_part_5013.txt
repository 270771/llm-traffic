Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any potential ICMP flood activity.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood detection if available, focusing on repeated SYN packets without completion of connections.
