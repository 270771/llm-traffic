Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field value "3" (the 4th field after source IP is "3"), which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP type 3 traffic is often related to network errors or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple destination unreachable messages are being generated from 5.131.34.101 to various 202.101.173.x hosts. This could indicate misconfiguration, network scanning, or other issues worth further network behavior analysis.
