Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from IP 151.105.96.5 to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.181 and 133.105.230.180), and one ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) from 203.78.140.213 to 162.113.225.103. While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, the volume here is very low (only two packets from the same source to different destinations within milliseconds), which does not match the high-rate, sustained traffic pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics involve detecting high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting one or multiple destinations.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from these IPs. If the volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if the ICMP type 11 packet indicates network issues or traceroute activity rather than an attack.
