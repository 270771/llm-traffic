Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and echo reply (type 0), which may indicate normal network behavior or other non-flood ICMP activity.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual traffic patterns or other types of ICMP misuse. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
