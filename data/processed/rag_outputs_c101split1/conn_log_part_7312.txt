Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 173.96.94.37 to destination 202.250.239.174, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic flow. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, since no ICMP Echo Request traffic is observed, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why the ICMP Echo Request flow shows zero packetsâ€”verify if logging or capture issues exist.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review other logs or anomaly sources for signs of different attack types, as ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) may indicate network issues or scanning activity.
