Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 0, 1, 3, 8, 11, and 20. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, this single occurrence (timestamp 1641013221.345120) does not indicate flooding by itself.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = echo reply, 1 = destination unreachable, 3 = destination unreachable, 11 = time exceeded, 20 = unknown) are not related to ping flood attacks.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination in rapid succession, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV contains no records, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 133.105.142.96 to confirm normal ping activity or potential reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Consider enabling ICMP rate limiting or alerting on excessive ICMP echo requests per source IP.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context is available, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 8 traffic alone is normal ping behavior, not an attack.
