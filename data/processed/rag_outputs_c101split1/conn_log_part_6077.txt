Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP types observed correspond to other ICMP message types (type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 0 = Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-related issues or misconfigurations, but no immediate ping flood response is required. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
