Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 11, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, 11 is Time Exceeded, and 13 is Timestamp Request, none of which are used in ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. However, the presence of multiple ICMP error and control messages could warrant further investigation into network issues or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.243.7.232, 154.137.199.145, 133.243.18.108) for unusual behavior or repeated error messages.  
- Collect additional logs or enable deeper packet inspection to detect other potential ICMP misuse or network scanning activities.
