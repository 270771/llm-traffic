Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 157.206.152.29 to 8.17.75.8, but it appears as a single connection record without signs of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types 1 or 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.152.29 for any unusual ICMP traffic patterns over a longer time window to confirm no flooding. Also, monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies or different attack vectors given the presence of other ICMP types.
