Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second has ICMP type 10 (Router Advertisement). Neither is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP error and router advertisement messages, it may be normal network behavior or related to network diagnostics rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Confirm that no other logs show excessive ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate a ping flood.
