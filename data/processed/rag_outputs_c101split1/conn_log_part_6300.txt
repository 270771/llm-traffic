Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record from source IP 58.142.235.229 to destination IP 202.250.221.20 with only 1 packet and 28 bytes transferred, which is insufficient to indicate a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is not observed here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP. If volume increases significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts.
