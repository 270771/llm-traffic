Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP connections with SYN packets (S0 state), no ICMP traffic is present, and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged. Since ping floods require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. The traffic appears to be multiple failed TCP connection attempts (SYN scans or connection attempts), which could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs for potential scanning or probing behavior. Correlate with IDS/IPS logs for SYN scan heuristics (commonly heuristic #1 or #2 in many taxonomies related to reconnaissance). Monitor for increased connection attempts or other suspicious patterns.
