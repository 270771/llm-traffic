Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents ICMP echo replies rather than requests, so it does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the lack of suspicious patterns and the ICMP type mismatch, no immediate attack is indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from the same source IP (120.251.226.36) to the destination (203.78.134.246) to detect potential future ping floods. Also, review other logs for repeated or high-frequency ICMP echo requests.
