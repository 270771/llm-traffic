Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 0 and 3, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics focus on high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages (202.125.201.9) to determine if there is a network misconfiguration or other issues causing Destination Unreachable messages. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
