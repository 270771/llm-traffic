Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it cannot be a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination or a high volume of such packets, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from the same source IP (130.187.233.195) to the destination (107.102.62.64).  
- Monitor for any spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP error messages that could indicate other network issues or attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack.
