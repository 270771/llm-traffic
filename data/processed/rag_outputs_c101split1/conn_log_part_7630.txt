Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.71.2 to destination 95.179.64.72, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual traffic. The other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of type 8 ICMP traffic with volume excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why the ICMP Echo Request entry shows zero packets; verify if logging or capture issues exist.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review other logs or network telemetry for signs of different attack types if suspicious behavior continues.
