Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is observable.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., icmp.log) to confirm no ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 flags are visible, indicating possible scanning or connection attempts.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or port scanning if such patterns persist.
