Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from `61.134.196.250` to `39.104.153.200`, but there is only a single such entry with zero packets and bytes transferred, indicating no flood or high volume of echo requests.  
- Other ICMP types present are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp), which are not related to ping floods.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic is observed, which is essential to identify a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP echo requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency from the involved IPs (`61.134.196.250` and `39.104.153.200`).  
- Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 11 and 13 messages if unusual patterns persist, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
