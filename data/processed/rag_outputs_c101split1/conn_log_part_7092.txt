Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the safest classification is that this is normal ICMP diagnostic traffic or a traceroute-related message rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.140.213 or to the destination 185.167.249.147. If such traffic spikes, investigate for potential ping flood or ICMP-based DoS attacks.
