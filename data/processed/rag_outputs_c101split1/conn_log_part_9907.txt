Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and timing of these entries do not indicate a flood pattern. The ICMP packets are spaced out with response times around 0.025 to 0.037 seconds, and there is no evidence of overwhelming traffic or repeated rapid requests from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or more sources targeting a victim IP, causing resource exhaustion.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the source IPs (e.g., 35.211.173.188, 3.241.1.60) show a sudden spike in ICMP traffic.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for potential denial-of-service symptoms.

No other attack types are clearly indicated by this data.
