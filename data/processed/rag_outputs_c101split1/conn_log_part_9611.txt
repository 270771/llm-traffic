Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code and type fields, which are both shown as "-" (missing or not specified). Without an ICMP type of 8 (Echo Request), the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood. The log shows a single ICMP connection with state "OTH" (other), which does not indicate a flood or repeated echo requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a classification.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed logs that include ICMP type and code fields. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would be indicative of a ping flood.
