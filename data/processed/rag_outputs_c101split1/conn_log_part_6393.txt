Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the log entries are 0 and 129, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and 129 is an IPv6 ICMPv6 type unrelated to ping floods. Therefore, these entries do not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 129 traffic (ICMPv6) for potential other anomalies or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible future ping flood attempts.
