Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry shows ICMP type 8 from 8.1.60.11 to 163.45.128.213, but there is only a single packet recorded (count=1), which does not indicate flooding. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic does not match patterns of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests typical of ping floods.

Next steps: Monitor for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify abnormal ICMP patterns.
