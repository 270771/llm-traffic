Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field set to 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 0 traffic to determine if it corresponds to legitimate Echo Reply responses or another benign ICMP message.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious ICMP types that could indicate different attack vectors such as ICMP-based reconnaissance or other DoS attempts.
