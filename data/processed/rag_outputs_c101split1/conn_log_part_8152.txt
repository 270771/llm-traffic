Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 3, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- The entries show ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are control or error messages, not indicative of flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious patterns are detected here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. However, the presence of ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) could warrant further investigation into network issues or misconfigurations causing these errors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP error messages to ensure no underlying network problems or reconnaissance activity.  
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, correlate with this traffic for deeper analysis.
