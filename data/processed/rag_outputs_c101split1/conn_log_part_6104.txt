Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or routing issues, this traffic may warrant investigation for network misconfigurations or diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusually high ICMP traffic volume. If such patterns emerge, re-evaluate for potential ping flood attacks.
