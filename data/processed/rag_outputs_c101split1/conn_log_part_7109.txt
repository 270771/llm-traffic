Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, also not an echo request. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions, the absence of type 8 packets means no ping flood is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.132.118 sending ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify other possible attack types if suspicious behavior continues.
