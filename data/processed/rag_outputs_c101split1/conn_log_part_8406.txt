Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641013225.58-1641013225.59). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is a classic signature of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single victim IP, overwhelming the target.
- Most likely heuristic number: 1 (ICMP Flood Detection).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) Attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 130.187.26.248, 133.243.78.0, 157.206.126.244, 157.206.19.249, 157.206.225.7, 157.206.149.10, and others targeting destination IP 163.84.73.84 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the traffic is Echo Request.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor the victim host (163.84.73.84) for service degradation and apply host-based firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised and take appropriate remediation steps.
