Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (destination unreachable), not 8 (echo request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but ICMP type 3 typically indicates error messages rather than attack traffic. No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection record.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
