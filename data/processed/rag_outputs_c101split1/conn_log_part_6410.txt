Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The observed ICMP types correspond to:
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable
- Type 11: Time Exceeded

These types typically indicate network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign alternative classifications.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing these ICMP error messages, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
