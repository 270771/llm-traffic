Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types are 11 (Time Exceeded), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 3 (Destination Unreachable). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages typically indicate network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages (154.137.211.165, 203.78.140.213, 157.206.133.122) for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
