Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a floodâ€”there are only a few isolated entries with no rapid repetition or high packet counts typical of a ping flood. Additionally, one entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if any of these IPs show other suspicious behaviors or if network performance degrades. Establish baseline ICMP traffic to better detect deviations.
