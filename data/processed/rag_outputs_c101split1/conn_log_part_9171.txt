Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request) from 203.78.143.78 to 209.110.63.6, which is a normal ping request.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) from 133.227.58.120 to 72.81.138.6, which is not an Echo Request and thus not related to ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types that may indicate other network issues or attacks.
