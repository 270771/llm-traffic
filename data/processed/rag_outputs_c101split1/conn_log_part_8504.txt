Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 157.206.151.37 to 44.198.161.223, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping floods.  
- No high volume or repetitive ICMP Echo Requests are present in the snippet to indicate flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could be normal ICMP control messages (e.g., type 11 is Time Exceeded).

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests in extended logs.  
- Correlate with network performance issues or alerts if any arise.
