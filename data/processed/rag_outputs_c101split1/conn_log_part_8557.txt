Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-", and no explicit ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is indicated. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the connection state "OTH" (other) and flags "F F" suggest these are incomplete or unusual ICMP connections but not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types and payload sizes.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts, such as ICMP unreachable or redirect messages.
