Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 11, 8, and 11 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 packet from source IP 139.39.124.30 to destination IP 203.78.143.1, but it is a single event, not a flood. The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be characterized by a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or more sources targeting a destination in a short time frame, which is not observed here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. If volume increases significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, verify if ICMP type 11 packets are related to network misconfigurations or other issues.
