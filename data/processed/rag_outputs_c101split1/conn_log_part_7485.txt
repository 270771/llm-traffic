Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations rather than attacks.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP type 11 messages that could indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity, but no immediate ping flood response is required.
