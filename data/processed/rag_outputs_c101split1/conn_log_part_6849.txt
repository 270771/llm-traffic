Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations." The taxonomy class is "ICMP Flooding" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.236.220.60  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.236.220.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.  
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.  
4. Implement network-level ICMP rate limiting to prevent similar volumetric attacks.  
5. Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
