Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries have a type field value of either 0, 1, or other than 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, none of these entries match that criterion. The ICMP types here (0 and 1) correspond to echo reply and destination unreachable or other control messages, which do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic volume from these IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential stealthy scanning or other network anomalies.
