Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column, which is `0` here. For a ping flood, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request). Since the type is 0, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed ICMP type and code fields, and monitor for repeated high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.227.58.120 to the destination 173.162.12.231.
