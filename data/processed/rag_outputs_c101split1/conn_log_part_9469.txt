Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3`, not `8`. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood attack. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, both unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate network issues or other ICMP-related diagnostics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network problems or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If anomalies appear later, apply heuristics related to ICMP Echo Request floods and update taxonomy accordingly.
