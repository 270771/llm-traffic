Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry from 133.227.58.120 to 49.239.202.190 has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) and therefore not a ping flood. The second entry from 60.12.65.50 to 203.78.135.92 has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Correlate with network flow data or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP attacks.
