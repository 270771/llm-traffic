Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 0 in the "id.orig_p" field (value 11 corresponds to the ICMP protocol number, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given here). However, the key indicator for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since the provided log entries do not specify ICMP type 8 and no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, there is no evidence of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The connections are marked as OTH (other), with no payload or flags suggesting a different known attack pattern.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payload sizes.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules that specifically flag high-rate ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods early.
