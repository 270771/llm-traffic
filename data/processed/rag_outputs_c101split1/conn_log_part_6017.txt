Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows traffic from 202.250.197.25 to 203.78.143.78 with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, this does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP entry has missing type information ("-"), so it cannot be confirmed as an echo request either.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another attack type.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the observed ICMP type 3 traffic typically indicates network diagnostics or error messages, not an attack.  
- The OTH (other) connection state flags suggest irregular or incomplete connections but do not confirm flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 202.250.197.25 for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior due to repeated ICMP type 3 messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) or high packet rates that could indicate future ping flood attempts.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and rate data to improve detection accuracy.
