Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP connection with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 54.236.220.60 to destination 163.45.71.81, with a single recorded connection and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic often relates to traceroute or network path issues, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from 54.236.220.60 to 163.45.71.81 for any sudden spikes. Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages from 203.78.140.213 and 133.227.58.122 indicate network misconfigurations or routing loops.
