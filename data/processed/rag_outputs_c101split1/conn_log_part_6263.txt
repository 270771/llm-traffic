Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further logs for sustained or repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to a target to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that may indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service activities.
