Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have an ICMP type field value of 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The ICMP traffic observed appears to be either Echo Replies (type 0) or other ICMP message types, which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to confirm their purpose (e.g., legitimate Echo Replies or other control messages). Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
