Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 11 and 8. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the legitimate ping request type. However, the presence of a single or very few ICMP type 8 packets does not indicate a flood. The other ICMP types (11) correspond to "Time Exceeded" messages, which are unrelated to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP echo request flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 103.42.57.68 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 133.251.146.97 to ensure it is legitimate traffic.  
- Correlate with other logs or network metrics to detect any unusual ICMP traffic spikes.
