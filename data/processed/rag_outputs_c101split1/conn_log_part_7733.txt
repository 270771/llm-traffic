Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `133.243.6.38` to `138.56.105.252` with a single packet and no signs of flooding (only 1 packet, no high frequency or volume).  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0, 1, 3, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one or more sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP `133.243.6.38` for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate ICMP scanning.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types that could indicate reconnaissance or other attacks.
