Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 157.79.162.189 to 163.45.128.78, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP abuse or volumetric attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at a high rate.  
- Investigate if 157.79.162.189 sends multiple echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential volumetric ICMP abuse.
