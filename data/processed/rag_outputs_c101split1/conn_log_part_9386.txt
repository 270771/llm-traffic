Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 1, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. The ICMP types observed correspond to Time Exceeded (type 11) and Echo Reply (type 1), which may indicate normal network diagnostic traffic or other ICMP activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or patterns in other logs, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
