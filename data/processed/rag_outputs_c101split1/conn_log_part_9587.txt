Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~milliseconds). This pattern matches the classic ping flood behavior where an attacker overwhelms targets with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source" and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.197.94; multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range. ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming echo requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.254.197.94 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for collateral impact on internal hosts in the 163.45.x.x subnet.
  3. Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 54.254.197.94 to assess if it is a known malicious actor.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
  5. Notify network operations to investigate potential upstream sources or compromised hosts enabling this attack.
