Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3`, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues.  
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network or host unreachable errors.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP behavior:

- ICMP type 11 and 3 traffic is typically diagnostic or error-related, not indicative of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
