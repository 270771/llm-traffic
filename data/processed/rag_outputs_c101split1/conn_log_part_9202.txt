Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP type 11 messages in a short time frame that could indicate a different network issue such as routing loops or traceroute activity, but this is not indicative of a ping flood.
