Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy related to ping floods or ICMP anomalies are available or triggered here.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high number of TCP connection attempts with S0 (SYN sent, no response) states, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity. Focus on source IPs such as 89.247.66.138 and 104.243.12.8 for potential port scanning or other TCP-based attacks. Further analysis of TCP flags and connection patterns is recommended.
