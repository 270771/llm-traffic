Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs, as the connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, or reviewing other logs that include ICMP type fields to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks. Also, monitor for unusual volumes of SYN packets that might indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activity.
