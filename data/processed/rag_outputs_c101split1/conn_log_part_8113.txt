Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record (first line) from 203.78.143.78 to 199.186.206.249, but it does not show characteristics of flooding such as high frequency or volume. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for rate-based alerts on ICMP traffic.
