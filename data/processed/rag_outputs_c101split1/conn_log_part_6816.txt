Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field value `1` (the 7th field after source IP and port), which corresponds to ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 1 traffic typically indicates network errors or unreachable hosts rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to identify potential network misconfigurations or routing issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
