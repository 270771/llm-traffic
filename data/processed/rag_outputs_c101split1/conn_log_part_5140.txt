Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The connections show mostly SYN scans or failed TCP handshakes (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or reconnaissance activity, not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without heuristic context, the best classification for these entries is likely "TCP SYN scan" or "reconnaissance," which typically corresponds to heuristics detecting scanning behavior and taxonomy class "Network Scanning."

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN failures (S0) for potential scanning or probing activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs involved in these TCP connection attempts.
