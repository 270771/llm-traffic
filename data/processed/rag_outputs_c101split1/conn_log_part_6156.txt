Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries have types 13, 0, and 1 respectively, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without type 8 ICMP traffic, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or related ICMP echo-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 13 (Timestamp Request), 0 (Echo Reply), and 1 (Destination Unreachable) in this traffic to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic volume from these IPs.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high-volume ICMP Echo Requests for future detection.
