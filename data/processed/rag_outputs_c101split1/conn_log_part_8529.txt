Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid succession and volume of these echo requests to different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.254.197.94  
- Target IPs: 202.250.216.37, 202.250.216.38, 202.250.217.210, 202.250.217.5, 202.250.217.2, 202.250.216.227  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.254.197.94 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or new ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.  
3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.  
5. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or abuse and coordinate with upstream providers if necessary.
