Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, and no ICMP traffic is detected, no other attack type related to ping floods can be inferred here.

Recommendation:  
Continue monitoring for ICMP traffic, especially type 8 packets, to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future logs containing high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source or multiple sources targeting a single destination.
