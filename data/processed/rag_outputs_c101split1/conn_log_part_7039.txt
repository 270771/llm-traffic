Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.114.27 and destination IP 185.167.249.223 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, especially if multiple such entries appear. Monitor for ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
