Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 13, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 11 and 13 typically indicate network diagnostic or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Time Exceeded and Timestamp messages to rule out routing loops or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
