Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which here is `0`. For an ICMP echo request (ping) used in ping floods, the ICMP type must be `8`. Since the ICMP type is not `8`, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given log entry. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often means the connection did not complete normally, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If further investigation is desired, monitoring for repeated ICMP echo requests (type 8) with high frequency from the source IP (163.45.185.102) to the destination IP (106.15.119.198) would be the next step to detect potential ping floods.
