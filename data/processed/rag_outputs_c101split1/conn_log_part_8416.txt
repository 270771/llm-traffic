Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP echo reply from 133.105.181.243 to 220.254.134.232, not a flood of echo requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is a single echo reply and not a flood of echo requests, it does not match ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if there is a sudden increase in ICMP echo requests or other suspicious ICMP types.
