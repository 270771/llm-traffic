Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but the volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a flood. The first entry shows a single ICMP echo request from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.29.237, and the second from 203.78.143.78 to 103.198.165.6 with a single packet each. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from one source to one destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if this were a ping flood, it would typically fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection and a taxonomy class of Denial of Service (DoS).

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from single sources to single destinations. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks.
