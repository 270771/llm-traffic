Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. There is a single record with ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641013200.154308) from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination IP 202.250.198.235, but it is an isolated event, not a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP Echo Request floods.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review network traffic patterns for other DoS indicators.
