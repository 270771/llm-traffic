Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, the absence of such traffic means no ping flood is detected. The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed TCP SYN attempts could align with a heuristic for reconnaissance or scanning activity (commonly heuristic #1: Port Scanning, taxonomy class: Reconnaissance).

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these attempts are malicious and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious source IPs.
