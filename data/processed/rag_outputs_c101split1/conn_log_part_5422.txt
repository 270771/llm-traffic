Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No explicit heuristics or taxonomy classes related to ping floods or ICMP anomalies are found in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Given the absence of ICMP traffic, no relevant heuristic or taxonomy applies.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or Zeek icmp.log files to detect any potential ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP echo requests or ICMP traffic volume.  
- Review firewall or IDS alerts for ICMP-based anomalies.
