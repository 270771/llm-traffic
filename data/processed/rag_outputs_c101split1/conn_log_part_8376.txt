Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an ICMP message that is not a standard Echo Request or Reply.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between IPs 202.250.230.253 and 64.190.198.207 to determine if it corresponds to another type of ICMP message (e.g., Echo Reply) or a misconfiguration. Monitor for any unusual volume or patterns that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks or network issues.
