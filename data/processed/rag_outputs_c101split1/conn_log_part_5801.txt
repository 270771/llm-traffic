Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.173.172 to destination 114.246.83.155, with a single connection record and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 10, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ICMP Echo Request floods would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to volumetric ICMP abuse.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated, high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. If volume spikes or multiple concurrent connections appear, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify unusual ICMP patterns.
