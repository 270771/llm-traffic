Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type fields are 1, 0, 0, and 10, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood is the presence of numerous ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 10 (Router Advertisement) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic for potential misconfigurations or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Consider enabling detailed ICMP type logging and threshold-based alerts for Echo Requests to detect future ping floods promptly.
