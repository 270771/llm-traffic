Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for potential SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if available, and monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs.
