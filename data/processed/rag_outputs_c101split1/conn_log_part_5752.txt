Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with no type specified (indicated by "-" in the ICMP type field), so it cannot be a ping request (type 8).  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.  
- The OTH (other) connection state and low packet counts further indicate no flooding behavior.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP Echo Replies are present without corresponding Echo Requests in the logs; verify if logs are complete or if other traffic types show suspicious patterns.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
