Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 4th field after source IP is the ICMP type field, here it is 11), which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 messages to determine if there is a routing or network misconfiguration causing excessive Time Exceeded messages, which could indicate a different network issue or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.
