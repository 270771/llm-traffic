Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated in the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood characteristics.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to confirm the absence of ICMP floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Review connection attempts for potential scanning or other DoS attempts given the high number of SYN failures.
