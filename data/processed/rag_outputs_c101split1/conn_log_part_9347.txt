Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are either TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.186.x addresses on port 5060 appears to be SIP signaling attempts or scanning, not ICMP ping floods.
- TCP entries show many SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed TCP SYN scans would typically fall under heuristic categories related to reconnaissance or scanning (commonly heuristic #6 in many taxonomies), and the UDP traffic to SIP ports might be suspicious but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or abuse.
- Monitor TCP SYN scan patterns from IPs like 89.247.69.146 and others for reconnaissance activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts explicitly.
