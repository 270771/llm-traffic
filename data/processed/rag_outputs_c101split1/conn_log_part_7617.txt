Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but the traffic volume and pattern shown in the snippet are minimal (only single entries with no indication of rapid or repeated requests). There is no evidence of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate other ICMP types or connection states if suspicious behavior arises.
