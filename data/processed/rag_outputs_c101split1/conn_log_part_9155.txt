Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field value `0` (the 7th field after source IP and port is `0`), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP type 0 packets (Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of a reflection or amplification attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
