Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port, here "1"), which corresponds to "ICMP Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 3, which is "ICMP Destination Unreachable" as well, not type 8.  
- Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity related to unreachable hosts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.169 and 139.35.90.124) for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.  
- If ICMP unreachable messages are frequent, check for network routing or host availability problems.
