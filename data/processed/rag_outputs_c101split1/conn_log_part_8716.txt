Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, not `8`. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are indicative of ping floods, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between these IPs to ensure it is part of legitimate communication and not a response to an ongoing attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal traffic volume from these hosts.
