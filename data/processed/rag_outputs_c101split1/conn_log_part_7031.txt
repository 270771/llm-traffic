Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single connection with a very short duration and no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that type 8 ICMP alone does not indicate flooding unless accompanied by volume or rate anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (203.78.143.78) to the same destination (88.228.205.2).  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets from 193.96.160.53 to 203.78.143.78 are part of a traceroute or legitimate network diagnostic activity.  
- Apply heuristics for ICMP flood detection when volume thresholds or anomaly patterns emerge.
