Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 3, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the traffic shows type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types observed (0 = Echo Reply, 3 = Destination Unreachable), this traffic may represent normal ICMP error or reply messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or patterns of ICMP error messages that could indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
