Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 216.250.210.151 to 203.78.142.121 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet with a very short duration (0.001905 seconds) and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests that characterize a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks require sustained high-rate ICMP echo requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity.  
- Enable rate limiting or anomaly detection on ICMP traffic to catch potential escalation.
