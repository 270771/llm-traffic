Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 13, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 13 (Timestamp) traffic for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume thresholds to detect future ping flood attempts.
