Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from IPs 203.78.137.65 and 203.78.141.124 to 39.123.87.124, with durations around 9 seconds and packet counts of 560. While these could indicate sustained ICMP echo requests, the volume and rate in this snippet are insufficient to confirm a ping flood attack, which typically involves a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets overwhelming the target. Other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, and 11, which are not relevant to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a higher volume and rate of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources targeting the same destination.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics and alerts for DoS conditions.  
- Investigate the sustained ICMP traffic from 203.78.137.65 and 203.78.141.124 to 39.123.87.124 to rule out scanning or reconnaissance activity.
