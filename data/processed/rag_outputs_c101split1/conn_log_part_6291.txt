Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 13, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

The first entry (ICMP type 11) corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and the second entry (ICMP type 13) corresponds to "Timestamp Request" messages. These types are not typically associated with ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, the presence of ICMP Time Exceeded and Timestamp Request messages could warrant further investigation into network routing issues or reconnaissance activity.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs. If a high volume of type 8 ICMP packets is observed, reassess for potential ping flood. Additionally, review network device logs for routing or timing anomalies related to ICMP types 11 and 13.
