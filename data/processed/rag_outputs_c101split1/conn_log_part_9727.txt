Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed ICMP traffic appears to be normal network control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP errors if network issues are suspected.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or other anomalies.
