Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 163.84.73.84.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests from many distinct source IPs within the same second strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood pattern.
- The consistent packet size (72 bytes) and very low response times (mostly under 0.0015 seconds) further support a high-rate ICMP flood.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP ping flood attacks: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources targeting a single victim.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (ICMP Flood Detection).
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 163.84.73.84 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Attackers: Multiple source IPs including 157.206.211.14, 157.206.103.8, 157.206.115.8, 133.243.121.33, 133.243.99.196, 157.206.150.249, 157.206.119.18, 133.243.87.193, 157.206.115.15, 133.243.156.140, 133.243.123.245, 157.206.88.7, 157.206.171.253, 133.243.87.196, 133.243.95.247, 157.206.167.221, 157.206.23.252, 133.243.107.1, 157.206.72.6, 157.206.127.238, 192.207.220.254, 157.206.245.34.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 163.84.73.84.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from identified attacking source IPs.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve defenses.
