Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections with SYN packets (S0 state) and no ICMP traffic is present. Specifically, there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP SYN attempts shown could indicate scanning or connection attempts but do not match ping flood characteristics.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are being sent in high volume. Also, monitor for SYN flood or scanning heuristics given the numerous SYN attempts in the TCP logs.
