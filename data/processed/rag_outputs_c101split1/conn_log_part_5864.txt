Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP types in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are either 3, 8, 11, or other values, but only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, only one record shows ICMP type 8 (second entry: 203.78.143.78 â†’ 192.82.172.253), but there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid repetition of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded, etc.) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Without multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests or a pattern of overwhelming traffic, this traffic does not match ping flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet for legitimacy but no immediate threat is indicated.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (203.78.143.78) to detect potential escalation.  
- If ICMP type 3 or 11 packets increase significantly, consider investigating for network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy are not applicable here due to lack of anomalies or context.
