Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. For example, the entry with ICMP type 8 is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 159.147.128.250, but it is a single connection with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. Other ICMP types present (3, 11, 13) correspond to destination unreachable, time exceeded, and communication prohibited messages, which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 flood traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 for any unusual ICMP echo request patterns over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate ping scans.  
- Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP unreachable or time exceeded messages that might indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
