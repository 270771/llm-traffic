Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "OTH" (other), which means the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the "OTH" ICMP traffic to determine if it corresponds to another ICMP-based activity or anomaly. Collect additional logs with explicit ICMP type codes to better classify the traffic.
