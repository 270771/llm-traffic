Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types used in network diagnostics and error reporting.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (133.251.128.196 and 133.227.58.122) for any unusual volume or patterns of ICMP error messages or replies that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages could reveal network misconfigurations or scanning attempts.
