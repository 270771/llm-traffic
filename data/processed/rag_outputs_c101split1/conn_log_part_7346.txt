Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, this does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic could be related to network diagnostics or traceroute activity, which is benign.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection states.
