Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.72.129.52) from numerous distinct source IPs within the same timestamp (1641013236). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources flooding one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target." The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP type 8, no ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.243.147.175, 133.243.247.126, 133.243.247.117, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the field is 0.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52.
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts among the source IPs and remediate accordingly.
