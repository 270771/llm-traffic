Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is `3` (destination unreachable), not `8` (echo request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network issues or unreachable hosts rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or network problem causing these unreachable responses. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
