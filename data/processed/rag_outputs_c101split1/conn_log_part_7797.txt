Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 8, 11, and 128. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the single ICMP type 8 record (from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.55) shows only one packet (`- 1` at the end), which does not indicate flooding or high-volume traffic typical of a ping flood attack. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 128 = Echo Reply) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high volume traffic means no ping flood or similar ICMP-based DoS attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 and 128 packets if they appear anomalous in volume or pattern, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
