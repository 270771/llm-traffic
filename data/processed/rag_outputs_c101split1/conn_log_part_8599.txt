Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port: here it is "icmp" protocol, and the ICMP type is indicated by the "1" in the 6th field after source IP, which corresponds to ICMP type 1, i.e., "Destination Unreachable"), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of ICMP type 1 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but they do not represent a ping flood attack.
