Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping flood detection. However, the first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods. The second entry shows a single ICMP Echo Request from 172.23.68.231 to 133.251.157.205, but there is no evidence of high volume or repeated requests indicative of a flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at a high rate to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets are part of a traceroute or other benign network activity.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic volume to differentiate normal from anomalous patterns.
