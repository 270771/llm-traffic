Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an attack initiation.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior here.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.  
- ICMP type 0 is a normal echo reply.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from a single source to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages are part of legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.
