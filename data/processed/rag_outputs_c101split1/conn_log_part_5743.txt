Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the only entry with type 8 is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 181.38.252.249, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks fall under a denial-of-service (DoS) taxonomy and heuristic patterns involving high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. If volume spikes or multiple rapid connections appear, investigate further for potential ICMP flood DoS activity.
