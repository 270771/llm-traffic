Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN scans or connection attempts with no successful handshakes (flags like S0, REJ), which may indicate scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags and no completions for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for actual ICMP echo request floods.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning if available, as these connection patterns may indicate scanning rather than flooding.

Heuristic and taxonomy references cannot be assigned due to lack of data but should focus on TCP scanning heuristics rather than ICMP flooding.
