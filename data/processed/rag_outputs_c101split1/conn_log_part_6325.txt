Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or network path issues, these entries may indicate normal network diagnostic traffic or other non-malicious ICMP activity.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs if unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 persist, as excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages can sometimes indicate network scanning or misconfiguration. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
