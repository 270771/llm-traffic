Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 54.209.24.157.
- All these connections have ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The source IPs are different, sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds), consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to a single target strongly indicate a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests to a single target" typically labeled as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood).
- Taxonomy class: DoS/ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 54.209.24.157 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Source IPs: 133.227.218.11, 133.227.72.137, 133.227.225.149, 133.227.161.48, 133.227.201.8 (plus one unrelated ICMP type 0 from 172.23.68.231 which is not part of the flood).

Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for additional source IPs participating in the flood and update blocking rules accordingly.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle traffic if attack volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers).
- Log and retain all related traffic for forensic analysis and potential legal action.
