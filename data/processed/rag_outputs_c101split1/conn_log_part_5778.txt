Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11, 11, and 3 respectively. Since the ICMP type for an echo request (ping) is 8, none of these entries correspond to ping requests. ICMP type 11 is "Time Exceeded," and type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," which are not indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP behavior, a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based diagnostics or errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for further analysis.
