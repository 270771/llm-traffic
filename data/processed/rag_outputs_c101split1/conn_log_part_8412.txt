Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP types 1 and 13, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 13 = Timestamp Request), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature and frequency of these ICMP messages to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP type 8 packets should continue to detect any emerging ping flood activity.
