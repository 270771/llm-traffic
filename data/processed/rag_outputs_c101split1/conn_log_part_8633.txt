Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the volume and frequency indicated by a single entry with a single packet (count=1) do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high rate of ICMP echo requests overwhelming the target. The second entry has ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection states.  
- If anomalies appear, assign heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 for volumetric ICMP attacks) and taxonomy class "DoS/ DDoS" for denial-of-service attacks.
