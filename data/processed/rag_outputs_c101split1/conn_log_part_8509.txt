Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (3.243.126.119) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations.
- The packets are sent in rapid succession within the same second (timestamp 1641013226), indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV data and heuristic context requires assigning a likely heuristic and taxonomy based on common knowledge: this matches heuristic #1 (High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source) and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 3.243.126.119
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 203.78.129.162, 203.78.146.250, 203.78.131.186, 203.78.129.63, 203.78.135.87, 203.78.132.159, 203.78.141.197, 203.78.132.74
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 3.243.126.119.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Consider blacklisting the source IP at firewall or intrusion prevention systems.
- Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Investigate upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack source if possible.
