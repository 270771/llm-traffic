Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even the single ICMP record (timestamp 1641013250.243044) has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single flow with normal packet counts, not a flood pattern.  
- No high volume or repetitive ICMP type 8 traffic is visible that would indicate a ping flood.  
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents direct referencing, but by standard definition, a ping flood requires sustained, high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), which is not observed here.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Heuristic for ping flood typically involves detection of excessive ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.  
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service" (DoS) attack under ICMP flood category.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by enabling detailed ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with network device logs or IDS alerts for potential volumetric ICMP anomalies.  
- Monitor for other DoS or scanning activities suggested by the many TCP SYN attempts with no completion (S0 state) seen in the logs.
