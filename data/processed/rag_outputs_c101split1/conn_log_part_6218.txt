Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged, no ping flood pattern is detected. The traffic consists mainly of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating connection scans or failed connection attempts rather than ICMP flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood. Typical heuristics for scanning would involve multiple SYN attempts to various ports, which is consistent with the log.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of SYN connection attempts from multiple source IPs to various destination ports, as this may indicate a port scan or probing activity. Deploy network scanning detection heuristics and monitor for potential lateral movement or exploitation attempts following the scans.
