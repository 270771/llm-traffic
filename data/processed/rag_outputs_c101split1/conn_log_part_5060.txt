Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity. Focus on IPs such as 89.247.69.146 and 89.247.69.153 targeting port 8080, which appear frequently. Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or port scanning for further analysis.
