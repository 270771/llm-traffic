Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, no ping flood can be detected.

No anomalies related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to detect any potential ping flood activity. Also, monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from any IPs.
