Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting two main destination IPs: 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223.
- The timestamps are nearly identical (all within the same second), indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.x.x, 133.243.x.x, 130.187.x.x) are sending these requests, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, and the volume and rapid succession strongly indicate a flooding attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP ping flood: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources targeting a single or few destination IPs.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.152.104, 133.243.9.16, 157.206.156.17, 157.206.225.9, 130.187.46.249, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical hosts if not required for legitimate operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential compromised hosts within the source IP ranges and remediate accordingly.
