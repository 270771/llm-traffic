Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (e.g., icmp.log) to check for ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP anomalies.
