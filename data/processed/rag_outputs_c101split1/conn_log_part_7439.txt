Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields, which are both zero (source port 11, destination port 0), and the protocol is ICMP. However, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood. Here, the destination port is 0, which typically corresponds to ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) or other types, but not type 8. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other types of attacks. Without heuristic context or anomaly taxonomy, no further classification can be made confidently.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type codes and frequency. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.105.128.253 to destination 35.52.110.20 to detect potential future ping floods.
