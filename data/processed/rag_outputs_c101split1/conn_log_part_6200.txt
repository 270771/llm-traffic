Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with protocol number 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not Echo Request (ICMP type 8). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the safest assumption is that this is normal ICMP diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Verify the ICMP type field in more detailed packet captures to confirm the nature of ICMP messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the "Time Exceeded" messages are symptomatic of routing loops or network misconfigurations, which can cause excessive ICMP type 11 traffic.
