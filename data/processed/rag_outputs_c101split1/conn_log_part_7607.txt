Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in both entries is `8`, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.226 and 133.105.230.225). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a flood. The connection state is `OTH` (other), and the packet counts are minimal (`1`), which does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by a large number of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from this or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these isolated pings are part of network scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic volume thresholds to detect potential future ping floods.
