Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 1 and 3, but none with ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Specifically:  
- Entry 1: ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable)  
- Entry 2: ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable)  
- Entry 3: ICMP type 3 (Echo Reply or other control message)  

Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 1 and 3 messages often indicate network errors or diagnostic messages rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 and 3 messages, as frequent destination unreachable or other ICMP error messages may indicate network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
