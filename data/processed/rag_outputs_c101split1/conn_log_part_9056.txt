Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `11`, not `8`. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping requests. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP types, this traffic likely represents normal network error or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic with high volume from a single source IP, which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 or 11 messages are unusually frequent, as that could indicate network misconfigurations or other issues worth examining.
