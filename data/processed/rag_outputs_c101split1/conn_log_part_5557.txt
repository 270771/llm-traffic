Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP entries are visible, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicative of scanning or connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential SYN scan or DoS activity. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods. If ICMP traffic is found later, verify ICMP type to detect ping floods.
