Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 packets constitute ping requests, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but without ICMP Echo Requests, it cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of anomalies and the ICMP type mismatch, no immediate attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 68.54.248.134 and 203.78.143.78 to determine if it is part of a different ICMP-based activity or misconfiguration. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets or increased ICMP traffic volume would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
