Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single target IP address (163.84.73.84) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time window (timestamps all around 1641013226.814 to 1641013226.817). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one victim at high frequency. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Victim IP is 163.84.73.84; attacker/source IPs include 133.243.251.241, 133.243.100.254, 157.206.248.18, 157.206.21.9, 157.206.199.197, 157.206.200.250, 133.243.253.246, 157.206.108.232, and many others listed in the snippet. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 163.84.73.84.
  2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from identified attacker IPs if possible.
  4. Monitor the victim host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to broader DoS mitigation services.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet for further threat intelligence.
