Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0 and protocol icmp), which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Echo Replies are being logged without corresponding Echo Requests, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
