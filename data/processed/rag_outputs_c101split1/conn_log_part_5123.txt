Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- The connections show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The observed traffic may warrant investigation for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance due to many SYN attempts without completion.

Next steps:
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts for possible scanning behavior.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning if available, such as heuristic #1 (TCP SYN scan) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance."
