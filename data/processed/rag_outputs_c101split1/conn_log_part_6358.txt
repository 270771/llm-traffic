Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the only explicit ICMP type shown is 3 (Destination Unreachable) in the last entry, and the others have type 0 or missing but not 8. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) traffic for potential network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
