Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are relevant for ping flood detection. However, the entries with ICMP type 8 do not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding. The timestamps and counts do not suggest an overwhelming number of echo requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to link this traffic to known attack patterns. Without evidence of excessive ICMP echo requests or other suspicious behavior, this traffic does not match a ping flood or any other clear attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated connections from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If such patterns emerge, further investigation should focus on rate and volume thresholds to confirm or rule out flooding.
