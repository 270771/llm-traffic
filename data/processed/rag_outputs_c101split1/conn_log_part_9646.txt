Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is necessary for a ping flood. However, the volume and pattern do not indicate floodingâ€”only two Echo Requests are present with normal packet counts (30 packets each) and no rapid repetition or overwhelming volume. The third entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target, which is not observed here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 173.20.80.38 and 157.206.252.137 for any other suspicious activity.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
