Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or brute force activity. Focus on source IPs with repeated failed connections and consider correlating with firewall or IDS logs for further context.
