Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged, no ping flood is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ICMP-based attack heuristics apply here.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to determine if these attempts are part of a broader attack pattern. Monitoring for ICMP traffic should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
