Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column, which is `0` here. For a ping flood, the ICMP type must be `8` (Echo Request). Since the type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed packet-level data to confirm ICMP types and rates. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns that may indicate a different type of ICMP-based attack.
