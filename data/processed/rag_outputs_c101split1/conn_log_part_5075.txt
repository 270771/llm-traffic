Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided.

Next steps: Investigate why there are numerous failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state flags) which may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity. Focus on the source IPs with repeated connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.x and 185.138.73.101) and analyze for potential TCP-based DoS or reconnaissance attacks.
