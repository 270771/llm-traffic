Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 44.198.161.223, from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013226.16xxxx). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is:  
  **Heuristic #1: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single target in a short time frame.**  
- Taxonomy class: **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flooding.**

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 44.198.161.223 (receiving all ICMP Echo Requests)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.171.253, 157.206.100.86, 157.206.73.39, 157.206.172.135, 157.206.172.150, 157.206.237.104, 157.206.237.26, 157.206.237.189, 157.206.112.139, 157.206.75.110, 157.206.75.125, 157.206.51.168, etc.  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.198.161.223.  
2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood if they are internal or known malicious actors.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
4. Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.  
5. Review and harden host and network configurations to limit ICMP traffic exposure.  
6. Alert incident response team to investigate potential compromise of source hosts or botnet involvement.
