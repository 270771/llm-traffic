Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to confirm no ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from any IPs.
- Review firewall or IDS alerts for ICMP-based anomalies.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- Typically, heuristic for ping flood would involve detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class would be “Denial of Service” under ICMP flood attacks.

No ping flood or other attack is evident in the provided data.
