Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have ICMP type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is the 4th column after source IP, and all values are 3, 3, 11, and 3 respectively). Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries are type 8, this traffic does not represent a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connection states are all "OTH" (other), and no anomalies are reported in the anomaly CSV. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages to determine if they are symptomatic of network issues or other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial activities. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets would be prudent to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
