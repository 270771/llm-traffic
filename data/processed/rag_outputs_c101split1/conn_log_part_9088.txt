Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.239.70, 157.206.202.167, 133.243.89.236, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IPs (notably 52.223.127.239 and 18.46.237.125) in a very short time window (all timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests rapidly to a single target IP is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches a classic ICMP flood heuristic:
  - Heuristic: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources targeting a single destination.
  - Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: 133.243.239.70, 157.206.202.167, 133.243.89.236, 133.243.153.231, 133.243.179.250, 133.243.175.253, 157.206.242.129, 157.206.10.99, 133.243.223.213, 133.243.106.186, among others.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 52.223.127.239 and 18.46.237.125.
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required.
7. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
