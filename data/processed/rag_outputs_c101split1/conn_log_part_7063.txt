Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, which may warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 85.125.52.10 and 203.78.132.112 to determine if it is part of another ICMP-based anomaly or misconfiguration. Monitoring for increased volume or other ICMP types is recommended.
