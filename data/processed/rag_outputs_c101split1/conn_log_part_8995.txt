Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 133.243.206.29 to 104.73.239.5 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping).  
- The second log entry shows ICMP traffic from 133.243.18.106 to 198.158.109.245 with ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, not a ping request.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP echo requests from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The presence of only one echo request and one echo reply, with no anomalies or multiple repeated requests, does not indicate flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. If further investigation is desired, monitoring for a sustained high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP to a target IP should be conducted, as that would be indicative of a ping flood attack.
