Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from source IP 3.241.1.60 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping.
- The traffic is directed at numerous distinct destination IPs within a short time frame, with very short durations (~0.007 to 0.021 seconds) and consistent packet sizes (56 or 112 bytes), indicating rapid, repeated ping requests.
- This pattern of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is characteristic of a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 3.241.1.60
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP protocol, no ports involved (ICMP type 8)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 3.241.1.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional sources exhibiting similar behavior.
3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block or throttle traffic from the offending IP if it is external.
