Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 1, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) and other ICMP types seen here to rule out other reconnaissance or ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.
