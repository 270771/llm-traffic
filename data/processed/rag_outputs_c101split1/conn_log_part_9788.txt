Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from `130.187.200.251` to `3.17.238.136` with a single packet and low volume (112 bytes), which does not indicate flooding.  
- Other ICMP types present (0 and 1) are not Echo Requests and thus not ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of high packet rate, repeated Echo Requests, or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security incident is present. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and frequency for these IPs is recommended to detect any future escalation.
