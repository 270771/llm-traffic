Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field, which is `0` here. For a ping flood, the ICMP type must be `8` (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed ICMP type and code fields over time to identify any potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Also, monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated requests from the source IP 202.250.230.253 to 206.130.113.228.
