Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP connections with no indication of ICMP traffic, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The logs show SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state), typical of TCP SYN scans or connection attempts, not ICMP floods.

Since no ICMP traffic is present, no ping flood or ICMP-based attack is detected.

Heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, but given the TCP SYN failures, this traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a denial-of-service ping flood. This would typically fall under heuristics related to network scanning or probing.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN failures (e.g., 89.247.69.145, 89.247.69.144) for potential scanning behavior. Correlate with IDS alerts or firewall logs to confirm if these are benign or malicious scans. Consider rate-limiting or blocking suspicious IPs if scanning is confirmed.
