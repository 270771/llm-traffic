Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from source IP 119.255.136.125 to destination 163.45.184.134, which is an echo request (ping). The second entry shows ICMP type 0 from 133.227.206.33 to 100.84.99.85, which is an echo reply. However, there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP.  
- Investigate if any IP shows repeated OTH (other) connection states with ICMP type 8.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential flooding patterns.
