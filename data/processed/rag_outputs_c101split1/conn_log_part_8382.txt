Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no explicit ICMP type 8), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomalies, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps: Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (203.78.140.213) to the destination (162.113.225.176) at high frequency, which would be indicative of a ping flood. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP traffic volume anomalies.
