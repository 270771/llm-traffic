Ping flood alert: Analyze potential ICMP ping flood activity in this network log. The log contains 5 ICMP packets between 25 source IPs and 71 destination IPs. Key destination IPs: 163.21.9.30, 163.21.144.224, 133.118.0.248. Determine if this represents a ping flood attack.
Justified by anomaly: No anomaly data found.
â†’ Action: Initiate immediate traffic rate-limiting on ICMP protocol and monitor for sustained high-volume ICMP traffic. Consider blocking source IPs exhibiting excessive ICMP requests to prevent potential flood escalation.
