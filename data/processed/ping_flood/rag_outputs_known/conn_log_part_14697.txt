Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where an attacker overwhelms targets with numerous echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source in a short interval, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 133.251.127.243, 203.78.181.188, 163.252.29.247, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on internal or external hosts targeted by these pings.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify network operations and security teams to coordinate mitigation and remediation.
