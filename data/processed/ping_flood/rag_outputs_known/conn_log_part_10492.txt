Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" is appropriate here given the pattern.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.129.254, 163.252.1.199, 163.252.7.153, 163.252.194.208, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
3. Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 54.183.69.91 to assess if it is a known malicious actor.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential upstream sources or compromised hosts.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place to prevent recurrence.
