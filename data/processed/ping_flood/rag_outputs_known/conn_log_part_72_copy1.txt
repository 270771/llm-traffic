Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have a type field of 0 (as indicated by the zero in the relevant field), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 6 ICMP connection entries from the same source IP (203.65.114.222) to different destinations, which is below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these are known suspicious IPs or ports.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The OTH (Other) connection state and lack of anomalies suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail if available to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this source IP.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to better correlate suspicious behavior in future analyses.
