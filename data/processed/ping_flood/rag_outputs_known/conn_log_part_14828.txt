Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests is 8. In the provided logs, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (source IP 13.75.202.220 to destination 163.252.69.82).
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (only one).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 8 in the wrong fields or do not represent multiple repeated ping requests from the same source to the same destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns.
- Investigate any IPs that repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in high volume.
