Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) must be 8. In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (timestamps 1641791196.91292 and 1641791199.314059).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is 2, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- The majority of ICMP traffic shown is type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8, which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability or scanning activity but does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.65.114.222 to any destination.  
- Investigate the cause of frequent ICMP type 3 messages from 203.65.114.222, as this may indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
