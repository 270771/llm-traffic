Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) targeting the IP 18.36.162.241 from numerous distinct source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records or heuristic context means we assign heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) as the most likely heuristic, and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.145.201, 133.247.145.177, 133.247.181.59, 68.104.133.69, 18.76.108.217) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 18.36.162.241. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target IP 18.36.162.241 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
