Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP from multiple sources, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.129.182, 133.247.135.121, 133.247.30.190, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), port fields are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 157.187.159.183.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response for potential DDoS mitigation.
  4. Enable logging and alerting on ICMP traffic spikes to detect recurrence early.
