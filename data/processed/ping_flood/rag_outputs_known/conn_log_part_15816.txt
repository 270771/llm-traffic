Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ICMP type 8 is required for ping floods and at least 10 instances are needed to confirm a flood, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 3 indicates normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or multiple connections from the same source IP could be a next step if suspicious activity arises.
