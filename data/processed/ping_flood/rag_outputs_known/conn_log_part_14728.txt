Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (52.237.221.62) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.237.221.62; Destination IPs include 203.78.176.163, 203.78.148.80, 203.78.189.190, and many others in the 203.78.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.237.221.62 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
5. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
6. Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
