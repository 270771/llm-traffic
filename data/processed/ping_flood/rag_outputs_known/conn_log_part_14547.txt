Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 151.21.243.24 to destination 202.100.174.62 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP Echo Requests, which are absent here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in related logs.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate accordingly.
