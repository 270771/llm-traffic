Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (129.43.86.1) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of a ping flood. The rapid succession and volume of these ICMP type 8 packets indicate an attempt to overwhelm the targets with ICMP echo requests.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood attack. Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly list this source IP, heuristic 20 is the most appropriate classification here.
- The taxonomy class for this attack is "DoS" (Denial of Service), as ping floods are a classic DoS vector.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.86.1 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.114.237.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 129.43.86.1 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs (203.114.237.100-203.114.237.127) and ensure their availability.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify upstream providers if the attack volume is large and persistent to assist in upstream filtering.
