Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from one or more sources targeting a single destination.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.166.183, 133.247.33.116, 133.247.148.27, etc.) flooding destination 54.193.126.151. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used, no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.193.126.151.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the attacking source IPs (133.247.0.0/16 subnet appears heavily involved).
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Engage incident response to investigate potential compromise or botnet involvement of source IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., IDS/IPS signatures, anomaly-based detection) to prevent recurrence.
