Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting primarily the IP 34.44.165.118, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.44.165.118. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges. Additionally, monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes, and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet.
