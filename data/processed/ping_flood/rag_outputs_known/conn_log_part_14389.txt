Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.127.18.10 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.81.6, 133.247.244.48, 133.247.61.188, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.127.18.10 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the target host 35.127.18.10 for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet for longer-term mitigation.
