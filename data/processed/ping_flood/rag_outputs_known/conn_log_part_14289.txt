Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood). Instead, they show anomalies related to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters on TCP ports.  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are observed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) noted in the anomaly CSV, as these indicate potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if any network devices or IDS sensors are filtering or not logging ICMP traffic properly, as absence of ICMP logs may indicate blind spots.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is present; the current anomalies align with SYN-based attacks (heuristic 10), which warrant further investigation.
