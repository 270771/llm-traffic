Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks, as the volume and distribution of ICMP type 8 packets indicate an attempt to saturate the target.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.104.227, 157.17.189.34, 157.17.64.246, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (52.236.221.123) for performance degradation and potential service impact.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet, and update firewall rules accordingly.
