Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances targeting a single host.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.206.3, 157.17.203.71, 157.17.159.34, etc.) flooding destination IP 16.161.126.169. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood at firewall or intrusion prevention systems.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response for potential DDoS mitigation services.
  4. Conduct further investigation to determine if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet, and coordinate with upstream providers for source mitigation.
