Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances (over 20) of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the single source IP 124.121.97.181 targeting multiple destination IPs.
- The rapid succession and volume of these echo requests indicate an attempt to overwhelm the targets with ICMP traffic, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from a source to multiple destinations indicate a ping flood (heuristic 20 by inference).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IP: 124.121.97.181
- Destination IPs: Multiple (e.g., 163.21.114.46, 163.21.24.20, 203.65.121.246, 133.250.64.2, etc.)
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Review and update incident response procedures for ICMP-based DoS attacks.
