Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different source IP (89.3.89.164) and port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, but no such heuristic or matching anomaly is found here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) further, as it indicates suspicious TCP SYN traffic possibly related to a SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by abnormal SYN packets or ports.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' suggests partial or temporary anomalies, not a confirmed ping flood.
