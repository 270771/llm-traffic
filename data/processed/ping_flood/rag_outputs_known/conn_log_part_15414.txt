Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for all relevant entries targeting 54.193.88.34 is type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.
- However, there are only 5 distinct ICMP type 8 connection entries from different source IPs to the same destination IP (54.193.88.34), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.
- Other ICMP types present (type 1 and 13) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the destination IP 54.193.88.34.
- Investigate if the source IPs (210.122.60.185, 210.122.61.85, 210.122.62.33, 210.122.63.105, 210.122.60.131) have any prior history of suspicious activity.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
