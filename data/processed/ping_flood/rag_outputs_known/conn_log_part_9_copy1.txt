Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies.
- The heuristics present (e.g., 999, 10, 504) relate to other types of suspicious TCP traffic, such as SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and HTTPS anomalies (heuristic 504).
- The TCP flags in the logs show typical connection attempts and rejections, but no flooding pattern consistent with ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 in anomaly_177, as it suggests possible TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if the source IPs involved in anomalies (e.g., 107.81.9.228, 163.21.64.150) are known malicious actors or require blocking.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Taxonomy 'mptmp' indicates multi-port/multi-target suspicious traffic, not related to ICMP ping floods.
