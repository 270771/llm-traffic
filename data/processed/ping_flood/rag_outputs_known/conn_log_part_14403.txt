Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11 and 0, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the basis for ping floods.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.  
- ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 0 is Echo Reply, which do not indicate a ping flood.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 to confirm or rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other network logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
