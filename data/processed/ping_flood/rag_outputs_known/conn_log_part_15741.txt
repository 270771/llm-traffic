Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.22.191.77 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. Specifically, there are at least 11 instances of ICMP type 8 packets directed at 3.22.191.77, exceeding the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most relevant heuristic is heuristic 20 (based on the instructions), which relates to known anomalous IPs or ping flood detection. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.165.155, 133.247.165.217, 133.247.107.202, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 3.22.191.77 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
