Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP types present are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and the count of ICMP packets is very low (only one packet per entry).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 and 13 messages are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
