Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which corresponds to SYN flood behavior, not ping flood.
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by many SYN packets causing resource exhaustion.
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or anomalies matching heuristic 20 (ping flood) is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by analyzing SYN packet rates and connection attempts from 89.3.89.164.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or new anomalies that might indicate a ping flood in the future.
- Confirm if firewall or IDS rules are properly detecting and mitigating SYN floods.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomaly relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10), which is a TCP-based DoS vector, not ICMP-based.
