Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 13 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP 34.44.165.118 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 35.127.34.186) targeting destination IP 34.44.165.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16 and others) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 34.44.165.118 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to coordinate filtering.
