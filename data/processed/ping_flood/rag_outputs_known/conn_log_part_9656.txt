Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.26.217, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one source IP 61.1.51.193, all targeting destination IP 44.61.26.217 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor the target host 44.61.26.217 for service degradation and consider temporarily isolating it from the network if the attack persists.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
