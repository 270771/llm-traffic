Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 50.239.214.145, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to a single destination IP within a very short time frame strongly indicates an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source IP 112.227.248.70 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 50.239.214.145. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 50.239.214.145.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the affected host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic if it originates externally.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP echo responses on the target host if operationally feasible to mitigate impact.
