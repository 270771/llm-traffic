Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags suspicious source IPs sending multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class is likely "Denial of Service (DoS)" given the nature of ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; Destination IPs include 163.21.223.31, 163.21.213.13, 203.65.114.249, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts receiving these pings.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate blocking at higher network layers.
