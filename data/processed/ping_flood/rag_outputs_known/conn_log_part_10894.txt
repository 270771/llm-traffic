Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 18.76.108.217 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.76.108.217; Destination IPs include 202.194.15.184, 202.194.15.186, 202.194.15.190, 202.194.17.37, 202.194.17.38, 202.194.55.36, 202.194.13.41, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.17.63, 202.194.13.54, 202.194.63.1, 202.194.55.136, 202.194.55.22, 202.194.63.8, 202.194.63.3, 202.194.13.96.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 18.76.108.217 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
