Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are very sparse and isolated: one from 157.161.40.85 to 34.58.63.244, and one from 54.248.150.12 to 203.65.103.15.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in total, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.
- Most ICMP traffic shown is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not indicative of ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.
- Investigate the source IPs sending multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if network issues are suspected.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
