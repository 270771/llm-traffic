Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The source IPs are numerous and mostly from the 133.247.x.x subnet, targeting two main destination IPs: 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs (54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x range that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers and coordinate for possible blackholing or traffic scrubbing if the attack volume escalates.
