Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping floods.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the volume of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs (52.42.116.124) for any other suspicious activity or alerts in other logs.
