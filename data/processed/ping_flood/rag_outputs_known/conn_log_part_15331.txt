Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 130.197.144.160 to 123.64.161.243, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Echo Reply), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate if any other protocols or ports show suspicious activity.
