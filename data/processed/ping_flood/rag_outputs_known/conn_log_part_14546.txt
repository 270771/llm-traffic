Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8 respectively. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.48.182 for unusual ICMP activity if it persists or escalates.
