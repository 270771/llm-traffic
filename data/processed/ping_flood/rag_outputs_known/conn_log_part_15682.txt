Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies.
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The taxonomy classes shown are 'ptmp' and 'heavy_hitter', which correspond to TCP SYN flood or volumetric anomalies, not ICMP floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood anomalies (heuristic 10) detected on ports 8080 and 1433, as these may indicate TCP SYN flood attacks.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are generating excessive SYN packets or other suspicious TCP flags.

Heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic, and 'ptmp' taxonomy indicates partial TCP message patterns consistent with SYN flood attempts.
