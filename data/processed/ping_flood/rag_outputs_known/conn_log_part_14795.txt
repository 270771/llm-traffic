Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 35.119.5.36 to destination 163.252.71.140, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 35.119.5.36 or destination 163.252.71.140 appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
