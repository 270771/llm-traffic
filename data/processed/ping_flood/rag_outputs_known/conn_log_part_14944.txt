Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given as type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, these packets do not qualify as ping requests.  
- Only two ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information from the logs to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any unusual traffic patterns or alerts from other monitoring tools that might correlate with these IPs.
