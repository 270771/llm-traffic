Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 ICMP connections from source IP 44.53.133.97 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided. By default, this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ping floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.53.133.97; Destination IPs include 163.252.21.156, 163.252.247.181, 163.252.189.196, 163.252.192.71, 163.252.192.69, 163.252.247.142, 163.252.251.10, 163.252.125.212, 163.252.251.176, 163.252.100.254, 163.252.212.33, 163.252.98.6, 163.252.101.198, 163.252.247.162, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.102.48, 163.252.45.95.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 44.53.133.97 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
2. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., intrusion prevention systems with DoS protection).
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
