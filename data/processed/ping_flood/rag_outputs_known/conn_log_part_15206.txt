Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 1 (ICMP type field in Zeek conn.log is the 4th field after source IP and port, here showing "1"), which corresponds to ICMP Echo Reply or other types, but not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping flood detection.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and none are present in the snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by collecting more extended logs to check for ICMP type 8 packets and volume patterns.  
- Enable heuristic detection for ICMP Echo Request floods (heuristic 20 if available) once context is provided.  
- Monitor the involved IPs (133.247.106.1, 167.190.186.68, 170.222.23.129, 178.47.18.244) for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
