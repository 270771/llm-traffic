Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 traffic spikes abnormally, as it may indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
