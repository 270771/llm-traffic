Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate blocking at higher network layers.
