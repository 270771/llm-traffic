Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7, originating from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: ICMP type must be 8, and at least 10 such instances must be present targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.239.146, 157.17.138.38, 157.17.51.248, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the network perimeter or firewall.
2. Monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or mitigate the flood traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
5. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
6. Consider applying ICMP traffic shaping or disabling ICMP echo replies on the target host if appropriate.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting 54.179.180.7, matching the known heuristic for ping flood detection.
