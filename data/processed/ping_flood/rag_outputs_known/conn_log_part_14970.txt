Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 3 and 8 respectively. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The first entry (ICMP type 3) is a "Destination Unreachable" message, which is not related to ping floods.  
- The second entry (ICMP type 8) is a single echo request, which is normal network behavior.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential volumetric ICMP anomalies.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination 203.78.173.243 appear repeatedly with ICMP echo requests.
