Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- The heuristics present relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), none of which indicate ping flood activity.
- The heuristic 20 specifically stands for ping flood, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are observed here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN failures (S0 state) seen in the logs, which may indicate SYN flood or scanning activity (heuristic 10).
- Correlate with IDS/IPS logs for SYN flood detection.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes in other logs to rule out ping floods.

No ping flood attack is detected at this time.
