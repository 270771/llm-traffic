Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they mostly indicate SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters on TCP ports.  
- Heuristic 20 specifically relates to ping floods, which require ICMP type 8 packets in quantity (â‰¥10) or matching anomalous IPs flagged under heuristic 20, none of which appear here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) indicated by anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012, as these suggest potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts involved in anomalies are exhibiting unusual network behavior or resource exhaustion.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP connection attempts with SYN flags.  
- The taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior.
