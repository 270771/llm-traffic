Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (3.83.92.175) within a very short time window, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this pattern aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.83.92.175.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block the attacking source IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from identified source IPs if the attack persists.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the target host is vulnerable or misconfigured to better withstand future ICMP floods.
