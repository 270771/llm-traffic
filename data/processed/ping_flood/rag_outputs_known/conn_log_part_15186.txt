Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
