Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection is from a different source IP within the 157.17.x.x range, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests, consistent with a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 157.17.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP: 16.161.126.169; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs in the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet if they are internal or compromised hosts.
3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to identify possible botnet or compromised hosts.
4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or escalation.
5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature specifically tuned to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
