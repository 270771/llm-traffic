Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175. This exceeds the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and categorizes the anomaly as 'ntscICecrqICecrprp'â€”a label consistent with NetworkScanICMP and DoS-related anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.235.151, 133.240.40.122, 133.240.178.17, etc.) all targeting destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 54.239.183.175.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 133.240.0.0/16 subnet that may be participating in the attack.
  4. Notify the upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Monitor for any escalation or changes in attack vectors and update firewall and IDS/IPS signatures accordingly.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the taxonomy class "NetworkScanICMP" indicating a distributed ICMP-based denial of service attempt.
