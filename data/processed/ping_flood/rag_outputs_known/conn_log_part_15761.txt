Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and unknown port anomalies, not ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 is categorized as "Other" for unknown port anomalies.
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or ping flood heuristics (20) is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood indicated by heuristic 10 (anomaly_782) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if the unknown port anomaly (anomaly_1442) on destination IP 45.136.197.42 port 46280 requires further network or host-based investigation.
