Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 128, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (source IP 82.26.149.149 to destination 202.194.9.210). This single occurrence does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (128 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The single ICMP Echo Request could be normal network activity or a benign ping.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made. However, to ensure no stealthy or low-rate ping flood is occurring, it is recommended to:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP over a short time window.  
- Correlate with other logs or network telemetry for volume spikes or related anomalies.
