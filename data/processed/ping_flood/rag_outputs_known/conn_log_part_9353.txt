Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.254.250.38) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack. By default, this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) if such were present, but here the volume threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is clearly exceeded.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38 is flooding multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on the targeted destination IPs.
- Conduct a threat intelligence check on 54.254.250.38 to determine if it is a known malicious actor.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to stop the attack closer to the source.
