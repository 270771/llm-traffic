Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations within a short time frame.
- The involved IP address is 3.80.126.221 (source) targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 3.80.126.221 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any signs of service degradation or network congestion on affected destination IPs.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify affected parties and update incident response teams for coordinated mitigation.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack consistent with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Flood."
