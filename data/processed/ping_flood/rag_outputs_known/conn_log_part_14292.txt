Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. A ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomalies or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded packet. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
