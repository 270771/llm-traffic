Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is met here.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 157.17.18.137, 157.17.101.7, 157.17.158.175, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.179.180.7.
- Monitor the affected host and network for signs of service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if the attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
