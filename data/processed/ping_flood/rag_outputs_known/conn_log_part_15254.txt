Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 90.154.7.119 to destination 203.78.187.167, but there is only one instance of this type.
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
- Collect more anomaly data or heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
