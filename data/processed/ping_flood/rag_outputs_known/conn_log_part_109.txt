Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the destination IP 54.239.183.175 from multiple source IPs in the 210.148.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies destination IP 54.239.183.175 as involved in an anomaly categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class from the anomaly record is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which aligns with NetworkScanICMP, supporting the detection of an ICMP-based flooding attack.
- Involved IPs include multiple sources: 210.148.127.206, 210.148.126.169, 210.148.127.225, 210.148.127.46, 210.148.125.146, 210.148.124.221, 210.148.126.239, 210.148.126.171, 210.148.124.226, 210.148.125.181 targeting 54.239.183.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.239.183.175 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 210.148.124.0/24 to 210.148.127.255 until the attack subsides.
3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other network logs to detect potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
4. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
5. Consider deploying an ICMP flood-specific mitigation appliance or service if attacks persist.

This detection is supported by heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy class, confirming a classic ICMP Echo Request flood attack.
