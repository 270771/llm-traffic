Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries show ICMP type 8 (timestamps 1641790878.3019 and 1641790878.706645), both targeting 203.65.103.15.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is only 2, which is below the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, or are unspecified, which do not match the ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP activity or unrelated ICMP messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs, especially 203.65.114.222 and 54.212.218.127, as they appear multiple times in the logs.  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) messages seen, as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
