Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.20.63.105 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many hosts send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a "Ping flood" attack, and categorizes the anomaly as 'ntscICecrqICecrprp' under the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy class. This confirms the detection aligns with known ping flood heuristics.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.77.6, 133.240.31.141, 133.240.85.89, etc.) are flooding ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.20.63.105. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.20.63.105.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood (133.240.77.6, 133.240.31.141, etc.) to prevent further attack traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or secondary attacks.
  4. Notify the affected system owner of 3.20.63.105 to prepare for potential service disruption and apply host-based protections such as firewall rules.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature tuned to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, requiring immediate mitigation to protect the targeted host.
