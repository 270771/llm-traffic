Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8 except one entry with type 10, which is not relevant to the ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.63.254, 157.17.107.30, 157.17.107.211, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs temporarily.
- Monitor the target host 16.161.126.169 for service degradation or outages.
- Investigate upstream network devices for possible ingress filtering to prevent spoofed ICMP floods.
- Alert the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation or broader attack patterns.
