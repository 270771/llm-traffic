Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 11, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP connections total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) suggest normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages, which could indicate other network issues.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to improve detection accuracy.
