Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 1, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP entries are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 and 1 traffic if unusual patterns emerge.
