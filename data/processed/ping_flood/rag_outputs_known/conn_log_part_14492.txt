Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 1, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 1 (Destination Unreachable) are typically error messages, not indicative of flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate ICMP error messages, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.
