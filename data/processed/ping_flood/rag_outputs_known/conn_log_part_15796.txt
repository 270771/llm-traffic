Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP echo request traffic from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.194.193, 163.252.158.35, 163.252.179.237, 163.252.45.181, and many others as listed.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
