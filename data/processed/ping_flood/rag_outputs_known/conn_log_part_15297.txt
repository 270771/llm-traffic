Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 16.160.152.89 and 202.100.175.250. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 and 10, which do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The OTH (other) state and low packet counts do not indicate a volumetric or scanning attack.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, which may indicate early-stage reconnaissance or flooding.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
