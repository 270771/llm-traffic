Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 54.220.233.141 to multiple destination IPs. If the count exceeds 10 or if anomaly data emerges, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, consider correlating with network performance metrics or IDS alerts to detect potential volumetric attacks.
