Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries, the total count of such packets is exactly 9, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override this threshold. The other ICMP traffic (type 3) is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the pattern does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse source IPs to the destination 54.186.100.117, as this could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume or other suspicious behavior.
