Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation such as blackholing or sinkholing if attack volume escalates.
