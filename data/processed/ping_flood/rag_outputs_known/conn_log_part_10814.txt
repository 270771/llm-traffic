Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating predominantly from IP 54.200.201.221 targeting numerous destination IPs (e.g., 203.78.188.123, 203.78.178.89, 203.78.181.175, etc.). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8 (echo request), which matches the known requirement for ping flood detection.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.200.201.221 flooding multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range; other sources like 130.197.x.x and 133.247.x.x are present but less active.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type and code fields confirm echo requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.200.201.221 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP 54.200.201.221 to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
4. Implement network-level anomaly detection rules to alert on similar ICMP flooding patterns in the future.
5. Notify upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and persistent in attack behavior.
