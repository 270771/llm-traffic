Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.230.228.52 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16.
  2. Engage upstream providers to filter or block traffic from these sources if possible.
  3. Monitor the target host 52.230.228.52 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Conduct further investigation to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
  5. Deploy intrusion prevention systems (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attacks.
