Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.220.233.141) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching this attack.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle traffic from the offending IP if attack volume escalates.
