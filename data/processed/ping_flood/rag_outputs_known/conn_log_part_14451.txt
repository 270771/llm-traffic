Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 157.17.55.172 to destination 3.115.224.159, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.
- The other ICMP entries are type 0 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets is normal in network traffic.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in high volume over time.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
