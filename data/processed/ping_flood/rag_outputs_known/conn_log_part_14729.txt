Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.237.221.62) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is typically "Denial of Service" (DoS).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.237.221.62; Destination IPs include 203.78.180.42, 203.78.189.184, 203.78.181.138, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.237.221.62 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Notify affected network segments and prepare mitigation strategies such as ICMP filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacker.
- Update IDS/IPS signatures to detect similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
