Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.
- All connections show TCP flags consistent with SYN scans or failed TCP handshakes (S0), not ICMP traffic.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic explicitly or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood or scan).
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks (ICMP Echo Request floods).

No ping flood is detected here; the current anomalies relate to TCP SYN activity, which should be monitored separately.
