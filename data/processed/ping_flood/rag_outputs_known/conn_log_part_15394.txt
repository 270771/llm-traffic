Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP instances total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-volume or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious behavior in other protocols or logs.
