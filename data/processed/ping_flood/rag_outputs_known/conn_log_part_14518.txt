Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly present is anomaly_782, related to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, indicating a possible SYN flood or SYN-based attack, not a ping flood.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve abnormal SYN packets to exhaust resources.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 likely refers to partial or temporary anomalies related to TCP port misuse or SYN flood attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or other TCP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Verify if other logs (e.g., ICMP logs) are available to confirm absence of ping flood activity.
