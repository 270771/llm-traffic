Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The anomalies found relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and an unknown heuristic 999, neither of which indicate ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks, which require ICMP type 8 traffic.
- The anomalies present correspond to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (other), indicating different attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Confirm if ICMP logging is enabled and functioning correctly to ensure visibility into ICMP-based attacks.
