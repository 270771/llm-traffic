Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 3 instances are observed targeting 16.160.152.89 (from IPs 133.228.177.251, 133.228.240.104, and 133.228.218.6). This is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood attack. The other ICMP packets (type 13 and 3) do not correspond to ping requests and thus are irrelevant for ping flood detection.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. Given the low volume and lack of supporting data, no attack is currently indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other sources. Investigate if any of these IPs have prior suspicious activity or match heuristic 20 once context is available.
