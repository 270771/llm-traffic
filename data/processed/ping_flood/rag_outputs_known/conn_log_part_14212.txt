Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting two distinct destination IPs: 3.121.216.42 and 52.158.11.176.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood or ICMP flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.

Involved IP addresses:
- Destinations: 3.121.216.42, 52.158.11.176
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet

Ports:
- ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting the affected destination IPs.
- Block or throttle traffic from suspicious source IPs if they continue to send excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor network devices and hosts 3.121.216.42 and 52.158.11.176 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader attack vectors.
