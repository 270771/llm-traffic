Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from source IP 35.183.65.24 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is triggered here: ICMP type 8 with at least 10 instances from the same source IP.
- The involved IP address is 35.183.65.24 (source) targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x and 34.25.x.x ranges. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related sources.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or devices that may be launching the attack.
  4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from this attacker IP.
  5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or DDoS protection services.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, type, and source consistency in the logs.
