Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; all recorded heuristics are 10 (SYN attack), 999 (heavy hitter), or others unrelated to ICMP.  
- The heuristics and taxonomy context confirms heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood, which is absent here.

No other attack type matching the current data is evident either, as the logs mostly show failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP DNS traffic, which are typical but not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log may not log ICMP by default or may require icmp.log for detailed ICMP analysis.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect any potential ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or anomalies flagged with heuristic 20 in future logs.
