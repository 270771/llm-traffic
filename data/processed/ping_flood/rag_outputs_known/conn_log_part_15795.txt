Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range.
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.19.4, 163.252.105.252, 163.252.96.57, and others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8 echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
