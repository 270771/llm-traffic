Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous src/dst IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.114.198, 157.17.230.198, 157.17.179.167, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the destination host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack traffic if it persists.
