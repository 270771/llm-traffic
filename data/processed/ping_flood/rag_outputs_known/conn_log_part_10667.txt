Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61). This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to the same destination IPs is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IPs 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate given the volume and nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify affected network owners and coordinate to trace back and block malicious sources upstream if possible.
- Monitor network performance and logs closely for signs of continued or escalated attack activity.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if business impact is severe.
