Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood.
- The count of ICMP type 8 instances exceeds the threshold of 10, confirming the volume needed to classify this as a ping flood.
- No known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present in the snippet, so the volume threshold applies.
- Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly reference this traffic or heuristic 20, the observed behavior aligns with a classic ping flood attack pattern. Assign heuristic number 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/ DDoS" as the most likely classification.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Destination IP: 52.237.221.62 (target of the flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.17.9.61 through 157.17.227.115 (various hosts)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.237.221.62.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious subnets.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.
