Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not explicitly stated as 8 (echo request), and only one packet is present. There are no multiple ICMP type 8 packets (minimum 10 required) to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. Collect more data to identify potential volumetric ICMP attacks or other anomalies.
