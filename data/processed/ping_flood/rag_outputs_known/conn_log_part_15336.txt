Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the snippet are mostly type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable - Host Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one entry shows ICMP type 8, and it appears only once, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 and 1 messages are normal network error messages, not indicative of flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated error messages that could indicate network issues or other attack types.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to identify potential threats.
