Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.109.186, 133.247.153.68, 133.247.44.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 3.116.11.97 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
