Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances total, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition indicative of a flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
