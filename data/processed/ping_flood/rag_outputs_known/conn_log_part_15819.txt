Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping flood detection.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Investigate if the IPs involved have prior history of suspicious behavior in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
