Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and the destination IP 54.229.78.71. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.229.78.71.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
  5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
