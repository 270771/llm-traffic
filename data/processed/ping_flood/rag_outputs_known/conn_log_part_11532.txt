Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.134.27) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 1: ICMP flood detection; taxonomy class: Denial of Service - Network).
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor the target host (34.25.134.27) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
