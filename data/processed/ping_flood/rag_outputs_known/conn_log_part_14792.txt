Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate network scanning or monitoring.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (35.119.5.36) to multiple destinations, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Investigate if the source IP is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if the volume threshold is eventually met.
