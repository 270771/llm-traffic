Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) by default, and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121 is the attacker; destination IPs include 163.252.12.24, 163.252.234.170, 163.252.253.193, 163.252.240.76, and others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
