Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). The anomalies present relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), none of which indicate ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets.  
- The anomalies detected (heuristic 10) correspond to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP connection attempts, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the TCP SYN anomalies further, especially those involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 (anomaly_782) and IP 133.251.127.196 on port 1433 (anomaly_1402), as these may indicate scanning or brute force attempts.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect early signs of ping floods.
