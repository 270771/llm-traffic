Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; Destination IPs include 163.252.200.201, 163.252.200.81, 163.252.27.91, 163.252.67.98, and many others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.221.141.21 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if the attack volume threatens network stability.
