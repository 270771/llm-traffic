Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, but the total count of such instances is fewer than 10 (only about 10 lines total, some with type 8, some with other types).  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found).  
- The traffic does not show a clear pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source flooding a target, but rather multiple distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination (52.238.213.5), which could be normal network scanning or benign activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) seen in one record is a normal ICMP message and not indicative of an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency from single sources to single destinations.  
- Investigate if 52.238.213.5 is experiencing unusual network load or latency.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
