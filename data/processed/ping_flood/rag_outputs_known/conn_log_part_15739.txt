Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.22.191.77 within a very short time window (~0.005 seconds). This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to a single target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.132.206, 133.247.80.11, 133.247.187.208, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels given the attack pattern.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) targeting 3.22.191.77.
2. Monitor the target host 3.22.191.77 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
3. Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation service to filter or absorb the flood traffic.
4. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
