Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The majority of these originate from source IP 143.224.94.6 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 133.26.144.x subnet, indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests sent rapidly to many hosts, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Additionally, source IP 133.16.14.149 also sends multiple ICMP type 8 packets to various destinations.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to "Ping flood" in the heuristic context.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with abnormal ICMP traffic patterns typical in ping flood attacks.

**Involved IP addresses and ports:**
- Source IPs: 143.224.94.6 (primary attacker), 133.16.14.149 (also suspicious)
- Destination IPs: Multiple in 133.26.144.42â€“63 range, plus others like 23.213.191.3, 2.214.106.3, 104.121.90.6
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the log shows port fields as 0 or unknown, which is expected.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 143.224.94.6 and 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Block or throttle ICMP traffic from these IPs to prevent network degradation.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential distributed attacks.
4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the suspicious traffic for potential upstream filtering.
6. Review and update ICMP handling policies to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error," confirming a classic ICMP Echo Request flood attack.
