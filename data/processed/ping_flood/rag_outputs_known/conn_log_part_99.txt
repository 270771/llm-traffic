Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The majority of ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one entry shows ICMP type 8, and it is a single instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages suggests normal network error reporting rather than an attack.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity patterns if it continues to generate many ICMP messages.
