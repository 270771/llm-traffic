Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IPs such as 35.71.8.235, 52.190.42.37, and 133.16.14.149 targeting multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.210.183.6, 163.210.170.22, 163.210.36.249, 23.218.171.251). This pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.

- The anomaly CSV identifies heuristic 20 as "Ping flood" and associates it with the anomaly record for source IP 133.16.14.149 (anomaly_314) categorized as 'icmp_error' under heuristic 20. This confirms that at least one source IP involved is flagged under the ping flood heuristic.

- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 35.71.8.235, 52.190.42.37, 133.16.14.149
  - Destination IPs: 163.210.183.6, 163.210.170.22, 163.210.36.249, 23.218.171.251, among others
  - Ports are not relevant for ICMP but are consistently marked as 0 or unknown.

- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (35.71.8.235, 52.190.42.37, 133.16.14.149) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Block or throttle ICMP traffic from these sources to prevent network saturation.
  3. Conduct further investigation on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Monitor network traffic for any escalation or spread of the attack.
  5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic originates externally to coordinate mitigation.
  6. Review and update ICMP handling policies to balance legitimate diagnostic use and security.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class 'icmp_error' indicating a denial-of-service attempt via ICMP Echo Requests.
