Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to TCP port 8080, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood detection, but no such heuristic or taxonomy is triggered here.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the anomaly_782 further as it indicates a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080, which could be a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect ICMP-specific logs or enable ICMP monitoring to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
