Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this and related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or malicious activity on the source host.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., IDS/IPS signatures, rate limiting).
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
