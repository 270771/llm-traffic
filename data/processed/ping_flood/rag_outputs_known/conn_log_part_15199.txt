Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping flood attacks.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters on TCP ports, not ICMP.
- The heuristic 20 specifically stands for ping flood, which is absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) related to suspicious TCP traffic on port 8080 and 1433, as these may indicate scanning or other TCP-based attacks.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high ICMP traffic outside this snippet.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on TCP SYN anomalies per heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heavy hitter heuristic 999.
