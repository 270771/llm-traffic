Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.  

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets.  
- The anomalies here are categorized under heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), indicating different attack types.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as multiple SYN flags with no completion (S0 state) suggest possible SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to capture ICMP traffic explicitly for future detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs to detect potential ping floods early.
