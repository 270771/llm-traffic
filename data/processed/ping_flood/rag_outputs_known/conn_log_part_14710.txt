Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 13.86.188.134, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.
- All ICMP types are 8 except one entry with type 10, which is not relevant to ping flood detection.
- The count of ICMP type 8 instances exceeds the threshold of 10, confirming the attack without needing anomaly exceptions.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 13.86.188.134 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no source or destination ports (ICMP does not use ports).

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target IP 13.86.188.134 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy network-based anomaly detection to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders if attack volume escalates.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
