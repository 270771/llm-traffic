Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic volume and frequency do not indicate a flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ping floods.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
