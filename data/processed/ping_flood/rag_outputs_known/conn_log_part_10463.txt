Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single record with no count of repeated requests (only 1 instance).  
- The other ICMP record has type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this threshold.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no taxonomy or heuristic can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the involved IPs (202.194.17.63, 167.190.186.79, 157.17.228.46, 44.61.16.153).  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data indicate suspicious activity related to these IPs.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
