Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting two main destination IPs: 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235. The volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs to the same destination IPs strongly match the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- According to the given criteria, the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets without any known heuristic 20 anomalous IPs confirms a ping flood.
- Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly reference these IPs or ICMP traffic, the lack of heuristic context means we assign heuristic number 20 (common for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/ DDoS" as the most likely classification.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges.
  - Destinations: 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Notify affected network owners (157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235) to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Monitor for any escalation or lateral movement attempts following the ICMP flood.
5. Consider blacklisting persistent attacking source IPs at firewall level and investigate upstream providers for source IP mitigation.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on volume, ICMP type, and target concentration.
