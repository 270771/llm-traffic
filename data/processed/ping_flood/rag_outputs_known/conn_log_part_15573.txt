Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 128, 3, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (from 58.241.3.103 to 203.78.206.64), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (128 and 3) do not correspond to ping requests and thus are unrelated to ping flood detection.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other anomaly indicators in extended logs. Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned at this time.
