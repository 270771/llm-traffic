Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 133.16.14.149 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for ping flood detection.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is flooding multiple destination IPs (e.g., 104.96.224.4, 23.87.109.252, 23.213.201.250, 23.182.210.7, etc.) on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- The pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to many destinations is a classic ping flood behavior, overwhelming targets with ICMP traffic.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on internal or external hosts targeted by this IP.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 133.16.14.149 to identify compromise or misuse.
4. Implement network-level ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and persistent.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error."
