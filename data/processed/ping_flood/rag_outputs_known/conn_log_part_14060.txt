Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo requests) is 8. The log shows three entries with ICMP type 8, but only one instance per source IP, totaling fewer than 10 instances. This does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- One entry shows ICMP type 13 (timestamp request), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and unrelated ICMP types.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or match known threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or distributed ICMP-based attacks.
