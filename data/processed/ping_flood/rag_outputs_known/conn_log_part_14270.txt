Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.34.186) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs triggering exceptions) not being present, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is met and exceeded.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of the ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.123.106, 133.247.152.198, 133.247.162.193, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.127.34.186 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (35.127.34.186) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP echo responses on the target host to reduce attack surface.
