Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.158.38.252. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern matches a classic ping flood: multiple source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one victim IP, overwhelming it with ping traffic.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a "Ping flood" attack, and the taxonomy label "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP anomalies, consistent with ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.158.30, 157.161.244.31, 157.161.244.123, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 18.158.38.252 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 18.158.38.252.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the victim host and network for signs of degradation or service impact.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a confirmed ICMP ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy class.
