Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.176.79, 157.17.176.205, 157.17.232.1, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the victim IP.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for further escalation or lateral movement.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or outside the expected network.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.
