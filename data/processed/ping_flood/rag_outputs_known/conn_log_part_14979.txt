Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance of type 8 is present (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.237). The other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, only one ICMP type 8 packet is logged, and no anomaly data or heuristics are provided.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 11 may indicate normal network diagnostic or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify any emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.
