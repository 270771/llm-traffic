Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with ICMP echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.183.198, 163.252.91.217, 163.252.90.251, 163.252.202.62, 163.252.132.9, 203.78.176.185, 163.252.46.1, 163.252.115.211, 163.252.91.203, 133.251.127.197, and others. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Specific security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on affected destination IPs.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
  5. Notify affected network owners of destination IPs to prepare for potential collateral impact.
