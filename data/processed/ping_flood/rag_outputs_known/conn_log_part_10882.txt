Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"Network Denial of Service (DoS)"** due to the nature of the attack.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IP: 52.42.116.124 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple 163.252.x.x addresses (targets)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block or throttle traffic from the attacker IP.
6. Review and update incident response procedures to handle volumetric ICMP attacks efficiently.
