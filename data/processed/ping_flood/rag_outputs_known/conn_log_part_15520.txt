Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries, each with a single instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) may be part of normal network diagnostics or traceroute activity, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating unusual ICMP error messages (types 3, 11) that could indicate misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
