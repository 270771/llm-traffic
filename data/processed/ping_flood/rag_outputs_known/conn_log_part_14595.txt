Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (line with src IP 54.253.0.94 to dst IP 202.100.174.62).  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8 or missing type information.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in related network segments.
