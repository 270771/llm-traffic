Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175, all within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, with the anomaly category code "ntscICecrqICecrprp" indicating NetworkScanICMP-related anomalous traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.239.183.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 54.239.183.175 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  4. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume escalates to coordinate filtering.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP) based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic targeting a single host.
