Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the destination IP 3.115.224.159 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources including 157.17.171.130, 157.17.157.2, 157.17.232.124, 157.17.196.57, 157.17.17.210, 157.17.50.10, 157.17.171.200, 157.17.170.237, 157.17.20.1, 157.17.49.249, 157.17.3.189 targeting destination 3.115.224.159 on ICMP (port 0).
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host 3.115.224.159 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Update firewall rules to drop ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious sources while allowing legitimate network diagnostics.
