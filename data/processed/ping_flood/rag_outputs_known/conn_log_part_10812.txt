Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.183.65.24. This high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection based on volume and type) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (e.g., 130.197.150.62, 54.200.201.221) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.183.65.24. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules.
  4. Investigate upstream providers or contact source IP owners if possible to stop the attack.
  5. Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service if the attack persists or escalates.
