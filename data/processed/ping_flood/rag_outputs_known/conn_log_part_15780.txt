Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type 8 (echo request) from 38.99.23.132 to 163.252.12.59, but only one instance is present. The threshold for a ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection entry. Further investigation should include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential flooding. Additionally, gathering more connection logs over time will help identify if a pattern of excessive ICMP echo requests emerges.
