Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from source IP 129.43.87.6 to multiple destination IPs within the 163.210.95.x subnet. There are more than 10 such instances (over 20 entries), satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern matches heuristic 20, which specifically identifies ping flood attacks based on high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests.
- The anomaly taxonomy class is "icmp_error," consistent with the anomaly CSV record describing suspicious ICMP traffic under heuristic 20.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 129.43.87.6; Destination IPs range from 163.210.95.98 through 163.210.95.114 and others in that subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.87.6 at the network perimeter firewall to mitigate the flood.
2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 129.43.87.6 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
3. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability in the 163.210.95.0/24 subnet.
4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules in IDS/IPS systems to alert on similar future events.
5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include rapid containment of ICMP-based DoS attacks per heuristic 20 guidelines.
