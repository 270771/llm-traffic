Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.61.16.153) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.248.19, 157.17.168.29, 157.17.64.190, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP protocol (port field is 0 as expected for ICMP).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the target host (44.61.16.153) for performance degradation or service impact.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
