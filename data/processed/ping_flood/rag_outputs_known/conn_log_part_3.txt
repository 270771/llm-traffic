Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time window. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to various targets matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to multiple destination IPs such as 104.92.234.2, 23.232.217.252, 23.91.143.2, 2.214.243.252, and others. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
  2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error."
