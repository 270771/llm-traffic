Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type field as "0" or "11" (seen in the 4th column after source IP), none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic appears to be ICMP error messages (type 11 = Time Exceeded) or other ICMP types, which do not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP error messages may be normal or symptomatic of other network issues but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP error message generation if network performance issues are observed.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify ICMP anomalies in the future.
