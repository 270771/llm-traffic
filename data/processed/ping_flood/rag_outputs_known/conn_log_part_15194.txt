Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no explicit ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) present. Only one ICMP instance is logged, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to identify a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single OTH (other) connection state entry. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs or checking other logs for related anomalies.
