Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs (many S0 states indicating SYN sent but no response).  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets (heuristic 10) for potential SYN flood or port scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Verify if the source IP 89.3.89.164 (from anomaly_782) is generating suspicious TCP SYN traffic on port 8080 and consider blocking or rate-limiting it.
