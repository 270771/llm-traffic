Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries present. Since the ICMP type is not 8 and there is only one instance, it does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack, which requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP traffic (type 11) is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No further investigation is required for ping flood, but monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types is recommended.
