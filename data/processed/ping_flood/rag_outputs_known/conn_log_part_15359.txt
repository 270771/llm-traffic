Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 1, which corresponds to "ICMP Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with type 1, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP error messages, which can be normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 packets to rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
