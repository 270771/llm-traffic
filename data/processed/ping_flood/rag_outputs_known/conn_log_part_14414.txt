Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.115.224.159, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied (e.g., 157.17.x.x range and 52.158.11.176), indicating a distributed or spoofed source pattern typical of ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack type.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16 and 52.158.11.176).
- Deploy network-level filtering or firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets destined for 3.115.224.159.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and consider blackholing or upstream filtering if attack volume escalates.
- Alert incident response team to investigate potential source compromise or spoofing and prepare mitigation for service availability impact.
