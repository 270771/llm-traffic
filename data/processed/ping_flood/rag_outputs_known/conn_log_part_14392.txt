Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type present in the snippet is 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request) appears only once (from 122.218.135.69 to 133.251.209.130).  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 entry is normal for traceroute or TTL expiration and does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.  
- Investigate if heuristic 20 or other heuristics become relevant once anomaly data is available.
