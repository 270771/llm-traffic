Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.173.100.241) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.173.100.241.
  2. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
  3. Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet for further mitigation.
