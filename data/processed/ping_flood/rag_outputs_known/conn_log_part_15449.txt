Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target. The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood in absence of known anomalous IPs.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Assign heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection based on volume and type).  
- Taxonomy class: "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood".

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple distinct IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.106.37, 157.17.67.158, 157.17.179.252, etc.)  
- Destination IP: 16.161.126.169  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor the target host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.  
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet, and coordinate with upstream providers for source mitigation if possible.  
5. Alert incident response teams to investigate and contain the attack, including potential blackholing or sinkholing of malicious traffic.
