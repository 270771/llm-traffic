Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.220.233.141 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; Destination IPs include 163.252.244.81, 163.252.136.214, 163.252.170.185, 163.252.147.29, 163.252.147.59, 163.252.115.79, 163.252.255.236, 163.252.238.126, 163.252.103.141, 163.252.103.224, 163.252.115.93, 163.252.180.207, 163.252.237.235, 163.252.3.11, 163.252.182.249, 163.252.19.100, 163.252.3.62, 163.252.103.130.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
