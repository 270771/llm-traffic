Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply) from 133.228.204.255 to 188.41.60.58. Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.3, but there is only one instance of this type, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, neither of which are present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out low-rate ICMP scanning or reconnaissance activity.
