Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records appear in the snippet.  
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) related to port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 further, as SYN floods can cause denial of service.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances from the same source or to the same destination IPs.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomaly relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10), which involves abnormal SYN packets potentially causing connection exhaustion.
