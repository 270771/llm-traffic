Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log snippet. The ICMP type 11 message typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

No further investigation is required based on this data alone. If additional ICMP traffic or anomalies appear, especially with multiple ICMP type 8 packets, re-evaluation would be warranted.
