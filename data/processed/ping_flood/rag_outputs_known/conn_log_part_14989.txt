Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 1, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types seen (1 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply, 13 = Timestamp) do not match typical flood or scanning patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate if additional logs show ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from any source IP.
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
