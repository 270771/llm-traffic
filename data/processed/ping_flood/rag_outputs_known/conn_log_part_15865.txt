Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.228.4.24) within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP, indicating a coordinated flood rather than a single host, consistent with a volumetric ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (known anomalous src/dst IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" in standard anomaly taxonomies.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct network traffic filtering to drop ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16).
  3. Monitor for further anomalous ICMP traffic and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying upstream DDoS mitigation services if traffic volume escalates.
