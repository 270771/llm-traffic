Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 133.228.170.168 to 52.236.221.123 and from 133.247.49.34 to 23.58.6.4). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests beyond the threshold.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
