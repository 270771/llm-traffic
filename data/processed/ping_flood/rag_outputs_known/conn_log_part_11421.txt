Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (18.22.226.126) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.22.226.126; Destination IPs include 163.252.7.94, 163.252.136.146, 163.252.115.15, 163.252.179.73, and many others in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.22.226.126 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Investigate the source IP for possible compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
