Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting 52.236.221.123, the total count of such packets in this snippet is 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override this count requirement.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears to be normal echo requests without excessive volume or other suspicious flags.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Further investigation could include monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window or checking for other signs of network scanning or reconnaissance.
