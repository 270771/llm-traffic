Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.173.100.241) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria specify at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 from the same source IP, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs related to ping floods), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Monitor for any additional ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact on targeted hosts.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
