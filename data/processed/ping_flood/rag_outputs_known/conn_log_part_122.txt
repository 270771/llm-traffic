Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP type values in the snippet are either 3 or 11, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 5 ICMP entries total, fewer than the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 sending multiple ICMP type 11 messages to different destinations, as this could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Obtain heuristic and anomaly context to better classify such traffic in the future.
