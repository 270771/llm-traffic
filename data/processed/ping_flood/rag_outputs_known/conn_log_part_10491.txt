Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting multiple destinations.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.150.70, 163.252.1.157, 163.252.164.1, 163.252.103.150, and many others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP floods or related anomalies from this or other IPs.
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP to assist in mitigation.
4. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Conduct a broader network scan to ensure no internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.
