Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 69.8.91.205 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are excluded.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20 explicitly, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class related to this heuristic is "NetworkScanICMP" (prefix "ntscIC"), consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 69.8.91.205 with ICMP Echo Requests (port fields are not applicable for ICMP).
  
**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
- Monitor the destination host 69.8.91.205 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other hosts receiving similar ICMP floods.
- Engage with upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if the attack volume is large.
- Update IDS/IPS signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns using heuristic 20.
- Consider deploying anomaly-based detection tools to identify future ICMP floods early.
