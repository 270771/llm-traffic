Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
