Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, which are used in ping floods.
- Although the count is just under 10, the rapid succession and multiple unique sources targeting the same destination strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard detection heuristics for ping floods, this matches heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: 157.17.1.122, 157.17.165.150, 157.17.98.37, 157.17.139.189, 157.17.61.6, 157.17.1.254, 157.17.165.144, 157.17.115.170, 157.17.44.46
- Destination: 52.236.221.123
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.236.221.123.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
