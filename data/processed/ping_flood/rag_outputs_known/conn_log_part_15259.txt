Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to TCP ports and other heuristics (10, 999).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are observed here.

Other potential attacks:  
- Several SYN scan or connection attempts are visible (heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attack).  
- Anomalies labeled as 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' with heuristic 10 and 999 indicate suspicious TCP connection patterns, but not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the suspicious TCP connection attempts flagged under heuristics 10 and 999 for possible scanning or brute force activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are generating excessive TCP SYN packets that could indicate a SYN flood attack (heuristic 10).

In summary, no ping flood attack is detected; the heuristics and taxonomy indicate suspicious TCP connection anomalies, not ICMP flooding.
