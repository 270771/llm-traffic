Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the minimum threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomalies are indicated, no immediate attack is present. Further investigation could include monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or checking other logs for suspicious activity.
