Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 139.179.133.57 and 203.78.177.156).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (1, 11, 13) do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not indicative of ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP types 1 (destination unreachable), 11 (time exceeded), and 13 (timestamp request) may warrant routine monitoring but do not constitute an attack here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated ICMP error messages that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, correlate with IPs in this log for deeper analysis.
