Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).
- No ICMP types other than 8 are involved in these repeated requests, confirming the nature as ping flood rather than other ICMP activity.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.93.2) all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs (157.17.2.196, 157.17.195.108, 157.17.103.1, 157.17.205.48, 157.17.191.0, 157.17.191.19, 157.17.18.186, 133.247.93.2, 157.17.205.63, 157.17.3.189, 157.17.205.57, 157.17.141.124, 157.17.2.197) to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor for additional ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying an ICMP flood detection and mitigation tool.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
- Review and update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns proactively.
