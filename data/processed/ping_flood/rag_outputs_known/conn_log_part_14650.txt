Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP message types.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting distributed ICMP floods) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x range and one from 203.78.184.2 (though that one is ICMP type 3, not type 8, so not part of the flood), all targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the conn.log shows ICMP protocol with type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.237.221.62.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare to isolate it from the network if the attack escalates.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet for further mitigation.
