Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show ICMP types 0 and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not exhibit the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs (192.179.222.9 and 139.179.133.57) for any other suspicious activity.
