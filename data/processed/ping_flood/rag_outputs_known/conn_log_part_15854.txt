Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or corroborating anomalies, this traffic appears to be a normal single ping request.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP or checking for other anomaly logs indicating suspicious behavior.
