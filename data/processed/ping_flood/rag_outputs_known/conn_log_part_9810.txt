Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The source IPs are numerous and mostly from the 133.247.x.x subnet, targeting two main destination IPs: 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- All connections are ICMP type 8, confirming these are ping requests, and no other ICMP types are present, which aligns with the known ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

**Involved IP addresses and ports:**
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.1.212 through 133.247.255.54 (various hosts in the 133.247.0.0/16 range)
- Destination IPs: 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are 0 or irrelevant.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns targeting the destination IPs.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Monitor affected hosts for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential denial of service impact.
