Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 15 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the IP 174.140.131.228, indicating repeated echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records are present, so by default, heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) does not apply, and the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is met.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 130.197.x.x range and 210.122.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 174.140.131.228 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- The most likely heuristic is heuristic 10 (ICMP Echo Request flood detection), and taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Flooding."

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (130.197.0.0/16 and 210.122.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target IP 174.140.131.228 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts.
