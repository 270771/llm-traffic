Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present according to the given data. The ICMP type 3 indicates a network error message rather than an attack. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in source/destination IP behavior.
