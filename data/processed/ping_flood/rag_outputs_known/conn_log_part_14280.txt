Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.50.134, 133.247.27.254, 133.247.24.25, etc.) targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 157.187.159.183.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
