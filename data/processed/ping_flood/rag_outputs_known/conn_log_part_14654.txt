Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection based on multiple ICMP type 8 packets) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one from 45.32.19.188, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor the target host 52.237.221.62 for service degradation and consider isolating it if the attack persists.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
