Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 157.17.48.98 to 54.179.180.7, and it appears only once.
- All other ICMP entries are type 1 (Destination Unreachable) or type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not ping requests.
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 1 messages may indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.48.98 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to better classify future suspicious traffic.
