Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is a single instance from 133.247.49.34 to 2.16.133.4.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 13 (Timestamp Request), which is not relevant for ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this threshold.  
- No repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests are observed that would indicate a ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged by heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume or source reputation.
