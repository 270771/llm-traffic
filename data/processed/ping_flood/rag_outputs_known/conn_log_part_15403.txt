Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 118.118.175.193 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are types 3, 11, and 0, which do not correspond to ping requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) may indicate normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any unusual spikes in ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) if they persist or correlate with other suspicious activity.  
- Obtain or define heuristic and taxonomy context to improve detection accuracy.
