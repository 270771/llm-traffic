Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows 15 distinct ICMP connections all targeting the same destination IP 3.22.191.77 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). This matches the known ping flood pattern where multiple ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target. The count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8, confirming the attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is **Heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection.  
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"Network Denial of Service" (DoS)** due to the nature of the traffic.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.238.238, 133.247.107.193, 133.247.54.154, etc.)  
- Destination IP: 3.22.191.77  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 3.22.191.77.  
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.  
4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider upstream filtering or blackholing if these IPs are confirmed malicious.  
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged for future incidents.
