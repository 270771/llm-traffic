Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries have types 11 and 8 respectively. Only the second entry (type 8) is an echo request (ping).  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The first entry (type 11) is a Time Exceeded message, which is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without further evidence or anomaly heuristics, no attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or bursts of ICMP echo requests.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination 203.78.173.124 have prior suspicious activity in other logs.
