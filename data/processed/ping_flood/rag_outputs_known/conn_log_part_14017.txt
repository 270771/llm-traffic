Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.173.100.241 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one IP) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (e.g., 157.17.65.56), all targeting destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.173.100.241.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further mitigation.

This is a confirmed ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
