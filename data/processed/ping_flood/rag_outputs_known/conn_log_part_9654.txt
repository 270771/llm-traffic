Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 44.61.26.217. This pattern of multiple sources targeting one destination with ICMP type 8 packets is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets exceeds the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 133.247.255.56, 133.247.131.202, 133.247.34.172, etc., targeting destination 44.61.26.217. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 44.61.26.217 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  5. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
