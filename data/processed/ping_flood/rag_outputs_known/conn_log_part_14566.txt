Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence from 133.247.187.209 to 163.171.172.30. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the snippet, no immediate security incident is indicated.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 packet if it recurs frequently, as it may indicate network routing issues or traceroute activity, but it is not an attack by itself.  
- Establish heuristics and anomaly taxonomy for better detection in future analyses.
