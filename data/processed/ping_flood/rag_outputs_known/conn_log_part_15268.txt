Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs flagged by heuristics, this traffic appears benign or normal ICMP probing.

No immediate security response is required, but monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from 36.94.72.106 to 202.194.18.188 is recommended to detect any escalation toward a ping flood.
