Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections where the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of excessive ICMP echo requests causing network disruption.
- Involved IP addresses include source IP 133.16.14.149 sending multiple ICMP type 8 packets to various destination IPs such as 23.248.27.164, 202.19.83.8, 182.129.119.14, 104.100.73.253, 184.165.72.250, and 104.102.141.254. Ports are not relevant for ICMP but are consistently marked as 0 or unknown.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for additional ICMP flood activity from other IPs to detect potential distributed attacks.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error" as per the provided anomaly and heuristic context.
