Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request). All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP packets are logged here.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 anomalies are present, which is not the case here.  
- The only anomaly record references a suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42 on port 46280, categorized under heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp', which does not relate to ICMP or ping floods.  

No other attack type clearly matches the current data. The anomaly with heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp' likely indicates a multi-protocol or multi-target pattern but is unrelated to ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42 further, focusing on the nature of the traffic and whether it represents scanning or exploitation attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp' have specific definitions in your environment to better understand the anomaly.
