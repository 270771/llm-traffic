Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.83.92.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x and 202.202.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.83.92.175.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying anti-DoS mitigation tools.
