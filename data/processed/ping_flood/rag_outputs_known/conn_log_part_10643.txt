Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.237.185.15 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) typically classified under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.232.1, 157.17.75.164, 157.17.1.117, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.237.185.15.
2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or amplification attempts.
4. Notify incident response team to prepare for potential DoS mitigation and ensure critical services on 54.237.185.15 remain operational.
5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
