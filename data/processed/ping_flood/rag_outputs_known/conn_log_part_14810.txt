Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from IPs 139.179.133.57 and 45.32.19.188). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume and mixed ICMP types suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
