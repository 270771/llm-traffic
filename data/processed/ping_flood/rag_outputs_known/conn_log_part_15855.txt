Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different source IP (89.3.89.164) and port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood detection, is not triggered or referenced in the provided data.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or alerts to identify potential ping floods.
- Monitor the source IPs for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN flood attacks, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.
- Heuristic 20 is specifically for ping flood attacks, requiring multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- Since no ICMP traffic is present, no ping flood heuristic applies here.
