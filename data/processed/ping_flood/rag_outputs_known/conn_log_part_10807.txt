Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from diverse sources to a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.247.127.57, 133.247.163.204, 133.247.255.102, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or outages.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse, as the distributed nature suggests a botnet or coordinated attack.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or trace back the attack traffic if it persists.
