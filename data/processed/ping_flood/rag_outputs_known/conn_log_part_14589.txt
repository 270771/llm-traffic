Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific attack classification can be assigned.

No immediate attack is detected; however, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or multiple ICMP flows from the same source IP is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
