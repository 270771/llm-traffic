Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), but none reference heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which aligns with the presence of many TCP connections with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, but not ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets (heuristic 10) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor source IP 89.3.89.164 (anomalous per anomaly_782) for further suspicious activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack patterns (TCP SYN floods).
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on TCP SYN anomalies and gathering ICMP data for comprehensive analysis.
