Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 157.17.105.97 to 139.174.78.33 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack pattern is evident from the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors (type 3) that might indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
