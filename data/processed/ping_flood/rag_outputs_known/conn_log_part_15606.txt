Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries total, well below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly flags, this traffic appears normal or unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any future entries with repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.
