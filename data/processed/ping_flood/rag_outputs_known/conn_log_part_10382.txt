Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.22.151.10 within a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 133.228.x.x ranges are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.22.151.10. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 18.22.151.10 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack traffic.
