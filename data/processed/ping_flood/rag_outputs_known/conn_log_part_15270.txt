Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code 11 (field 4 = 11), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 anomalies are present, which are not found here.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No attack is present. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or checking for other anomalies in related logs.
