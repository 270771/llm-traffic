Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) and the concentration on one destination IP strongly indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 16.161.126.169; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 16.161.126.169.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services hosted on 16.161.126.169.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
