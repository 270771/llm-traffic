Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from two main source IPs: 34.25.134.27 and 35.183.65.24, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP echo requests to many different targets strongly match the pattern of a distributed ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from the same source(s) to multiple destinations.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Heuristic number: Assign heuristic 20 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection in absence of explicit data).

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: 34.25.134.27, 35.183.65.24
- Destinations: Multiple IPs in 163.252.x.x subnet (e.g., 163.252.77.1, 163.252.21.198, 163.252.241.67, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs (34.25.134.27 and 35.183.65.24).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify affected network owners of the targeted IP ranges (163.252.x.x) to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IPs if they are not legitimate.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
