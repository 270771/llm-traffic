Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 6 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to the destination IP 3.20.63.105 within a very short time frame. Specifically, there are 5 entries with ICMP type 8 targeting 3.20.63.105 from different sources (157.161.195.212, 157.161.195.230, 157.161.43.175, 157.161.207.153, 157.161.207.7). This meets the threshold of multiple ICMP type 8 packets indicating a potential ping flood. Additionally, anomaly_57 explicitly flags traffic to 3.20.63.105 with heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack in the heuristic context.

- The anomaly taxonomy class is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which aligns with NetworkScanICMP, consistent with ping flood behavior.

- Involved IP addresses:
  - Destination: 3.20.63.105 (target of the ping flood)
  - Sources: 157.161.195.212, 157.161.195.230, 157.161.43.175, 157.161.207.153, 157.161.207.7

- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (echo request), confirming ping flood traffic.

- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests targeting 3.20.63.105.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or blocking these IPs if confirmed malicious.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect distributed attack patterns.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and apply host-based ICMP rate limiting.
  5. Review and update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.

This analysis is supported by heuristic 20 (ping flood) and the anomaly taxonomy indicating NetworkScanICMP, confirming a coordinated ICMP echo request flood attack on 3.20.63.105.
