Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The anomalies present relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), not ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the anomalies involving suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the suspicious TCP SYN anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as they may indicate SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to detect any potential ping flood attacks in the future.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from or to suspicious IPs.
