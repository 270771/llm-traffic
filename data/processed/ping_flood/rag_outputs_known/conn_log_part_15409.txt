Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP entries have a "0" in the port fields, which is typical for ICMP but does not confirm type 8.  
- Only two ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP traffic without volume or pattern consistent with flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP type codes explicitly to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or heuristic matches once available.
