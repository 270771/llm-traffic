Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 3 and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages or could indicate other network issues but not a ping flood.

No heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood or other attacks can be assigned due to lack of data.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
