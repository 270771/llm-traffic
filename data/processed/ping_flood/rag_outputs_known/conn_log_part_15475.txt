Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the conn.log entries show only single or very few ICMP packets (counts of 1 or 0 in relevant fields), far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the packet count rule.  
- The traffic pattern does not show repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP echo request counts from any single source IP.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP type fields explicitly to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly records.
