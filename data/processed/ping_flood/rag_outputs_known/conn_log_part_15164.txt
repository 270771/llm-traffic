Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.127.34.186) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from one source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.127.34.186; Destination IPs include 163.252.116.237, 163.252.99.227, 163.252.139.119, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.127.34.186 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Review and update incident response procedures to handle volumetric ICMP attacks.
