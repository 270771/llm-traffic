Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are echo requests, the hallmark of ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and one in 202.100.x.x (though that one is ICMP type 11, not type 8), all targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 and volume indicate a coordinated flood.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests to 68.104.133.69 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.228.0.0/16) temporarily.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the source.
- Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary ICMP blocking if service impact is severe.
