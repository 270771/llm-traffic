Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied (e.g., 133.247.126.15, 133.247.129.140, 133.247.243.59, etc.), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182), consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches were found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this fits the general heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting the same destination(s).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP Ping Flood.

**Involved IP addresses and ports:**
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.x.x range and others like 203.78.179.82, 163.252.9.202
- Destination IPs: Primarily 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting persistent attacking source IPs at firewall or router level.
- Engage with upstream ISP to trace and mitigate the attack closer to the source.
- Review and harden network devices to ignore or deprioritize ICMP traffic during attack periods to maintain availability of critical services.
