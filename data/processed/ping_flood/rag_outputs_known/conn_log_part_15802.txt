Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 7 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 from this source, indicating repeated echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations strongly suggest a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from one source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.192.102, 163.252.221.162, 163.252.189.254, 163.252.221.62, 163.252.247.184, 163.252.94.1, 163.252.1.38.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for further ICMP echo request spikes from this or other IPs.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for potential compromise.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
