Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 69.47.68.33, from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this fits heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 157.17.101.212, 157.17.76.236, 157.17.101.255, etc., all targeting 69.47.68.33 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host 69.47.68.33 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
