Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641099637.18xxxx). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 44.61.16.153 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack consistent with heuristic 20 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Flood."
