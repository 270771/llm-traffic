Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.116.11.97) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources: 133.247.75.115, 133.247.149.55, 133.247.74.240, 133.247.149.1, 133.247.106.198, 133.247.187.212, 133.247.187.214, 133.247.37.157, 133.247.184.111, 133.247.176.57, 133.247.175.11, 133.247.74.103, 133.247.74.189 all targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Alert network operations and incident response teams to monitor the target host (3.116.11.97) for service degradation or outages.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse; consider blacklisting or blocking at upstream routers/firewalls.
4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, allowing only legitimate diagnostic pings from trusted sources.
