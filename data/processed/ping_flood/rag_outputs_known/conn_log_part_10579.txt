Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.183.65.24 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source 35.183.65.24 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 35.183.65.24 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this source or others.
- Investigate the source host 35.183.65.24 for compromise or misuse.
- Notify network operations and consider blackholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
