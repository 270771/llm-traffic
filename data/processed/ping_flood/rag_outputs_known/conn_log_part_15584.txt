Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a host.
- All ICMP types in these entries are 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs mostly in the 133.228.x.x range, targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 16.160.152.89.
- Monitor the victim host for performance degradation and consider temporarily isolating it from the network if service impact is severe.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
