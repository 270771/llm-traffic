Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, not 8, which means this is not an echo request (ping) packet. Since ping flood attacks require multiple ICMP type 8 packets, this single ICMP type 0 packet does not match the known ping flood pattern. Additionally, there are only 4 packets total in this connection, which is below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 0 typically indicates an echo reply, which is normal response traffic.

No immediate attack is detected, but further monitoring of ICMP type 8 traffic volume and source IP behavior is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
