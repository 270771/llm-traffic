Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
