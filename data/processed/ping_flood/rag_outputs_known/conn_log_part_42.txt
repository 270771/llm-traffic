Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 133.16.14.149 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for a ping flood detection.
- The traffic pattern is consistent with a ping flood: a single source IP (133.16.14.149) sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in rapid succession.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding attacks.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IP: 133.16.14.149 (port 0, as ICMP does not use ports)
- Multiple destination IPs including 104.93.186.6, 104.115.153.248, 200.140.56.149, 193.37.175.255, 23.86.123.252, 104.120.235.250, 204.171.81.30, 23.90.239.5, 23.68.103.3, 69.35.3.246, 104.117.191.3, 61.76.4.5, 23.81.109.8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Block or throttle ICMP traffic from this IP to prevent network degradation.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the host associated with 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Monitor for further anomalous ICMP traffic and correlate with other network logs to detect lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
