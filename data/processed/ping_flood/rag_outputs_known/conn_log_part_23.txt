Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.174.6 to multiple destination IPs in the 202.252.225.x range, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). This matches the known ping flood pattern of a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests targeting multiple hosts rapidly.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood attack, which aligns with the observed traffic pattern.
- The anomaly taxonomy class relevant here is "icmp_error" under the "Other" category, consistent with ICMP-based anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.174.6; Destination IPs 202.252.225.69 through 202.252.225.91 (multiple targets).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 129.43.174.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability on the targeted destination IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 129.43.174.6 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events early.
5. Review and update ICMP handling policies to balance legitimate diagnostic use with attack mitigation.
