Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 13.208.10.201 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests").
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.208.10.201 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.208.10.201 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 13.208.10.201 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Notify upstream providers if the attack traffic is originating externally or if mitigation requires coordination.
