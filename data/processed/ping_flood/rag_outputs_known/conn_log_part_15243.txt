Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.193.88.34 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests").
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.193.88.34; Destination IPs include 202.194.15.190, 202.194.17.37, 202.194.63.1, 202.194.63.2, 202.194.63.8, 202.194.17.63, 202.194.55.170, 202.194.13.55, 202.194.13.98, 202.194.48.54, 202.194.13.96, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.48.62, 202.194.15.188, 202.194.36.13.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.193.88.34 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or denial of service.
- Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS systems.
- Consider deploying network-level ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies to mitigate future attacks.
