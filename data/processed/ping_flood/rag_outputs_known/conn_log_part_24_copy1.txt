Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.239.183.175. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern matches a classic ping flood: multiple source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests rapidly to one destination IP, overwhelming it.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a "Ping flood" attack, and the taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP anomalies, consistent with ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.250.253, 157.161.58.149, 157.161.157.76, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP (port 0).
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the log shows port 0 as expected for ICMP.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor the destination host 54.239.183.175 for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential mitigation such as blackholing or scrubbing services.
4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream ISPs for source mitigation.
5. Update firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests and alert on spikes in ICMP traffic matching heuristic 20.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, requiring urgent mitigation to prevent denial of service.
