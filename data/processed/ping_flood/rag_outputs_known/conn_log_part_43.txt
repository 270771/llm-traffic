Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time frame, matching the threshold for ping flood detection.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious with an anomaly categorized as 'icmp_error' under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The traffic pattern matches known ping flood behavior: a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly from a single source IP to multiple destinations, overwhelming the network or hosts.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 (attacker), multiple destination IPs including 185.221.202.113, 23.219.66.247, 23.68.63.3, 2.210.23.251, 23.232.121.251, 23.94.152.246, 23.247.208.252, 23.235.57.249, 23.221.11.5, 104.78.76.247, 200.169.88.26, 104.71.215.4, 23.222.198.250.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP anomalies or other suspicious activity from this or related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures to prevent recurrence.

Heuristic 20 and taxonomy class 'icmp_error' clearly identify this as a ping flood attack, confirming the diagnosis and guiding the response.
