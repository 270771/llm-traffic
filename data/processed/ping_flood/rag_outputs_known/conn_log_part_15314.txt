Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, these appear to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other threat intelligence feeds or anomaly reports.
