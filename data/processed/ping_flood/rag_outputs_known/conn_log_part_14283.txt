Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 69.46.227.121 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard taxonomy, this matches a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs related to ping floods), and the taxonomy class is "DoS - ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 130.197.61.72, 130.197.190.209, 133.247.173.120, 130.197.147.253, 130.197.60.180, 130.197.60.125, 130.197.62.99, 130.197.144.68, 130.197.24.129, 130.197.144.134, 130.197.144.193, 130.197.19.7, 130.197.190.210
- Destination IP: 69.46.227.121
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 69.46.227.121.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and identify if the source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if ping functionality is not critical.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the targeted host to assess impact and ensure no further compromise.
