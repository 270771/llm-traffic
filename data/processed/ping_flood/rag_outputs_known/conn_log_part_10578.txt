Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.183.65.24 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is typically "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
