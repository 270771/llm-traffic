Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (13.86.188.134) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- All ICMP types are 8, which matches the requirement for ping flood detection.
- The volume and distribution of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood pattern aimed at overwhelming the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP ping flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.1.249 through 133.247.243.55 (at least 20 unique sources)
- Destination IP: 13.86.188.134
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (13.86.188.134) for resource exhaustion and service degradation.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporary blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from a known malicious region.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet for future mitigation.
