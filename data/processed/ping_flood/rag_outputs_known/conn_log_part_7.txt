Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~2 seconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to various targets matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a "Ping flood" attack.
- The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 104.88.25.3, 23.179.127.251, 66.150.190.17, 23.70.136.252, 23.70.252.253, 104.115.54.4, 64.86.9.78, 23.238.214.1, 104.127.116.5, 96.198.124.247, 23.213.188.6, 2.209.31.3, 2.214.105.251, 104.113.22.2, 104.127.206.5).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or malware causing the ping flood.
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error."
