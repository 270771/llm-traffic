Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.229.78.71) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (133.247.191.1, 133.247.157.88, 133.247.39.21, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the Echo Request.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor the target host (54.229.78.71) for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential DoS impact.
5. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
