Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source without known exceptions.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or other IPs.
3. Investigate the source host 16.172.102.121 for compromise or misuse.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
