Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.158.38.252) within a very short time frame. This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and categorizes the anomaly as 'ntscICecrqICecrprp', indicating a NetworkScanICMP class consistent with ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.29.213, 157.161.45.89, 157.161.29.223, etc.) all targeting destination IP 18.158.38.252 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 18.158.38.252.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for potential collateral impact and consider blackholing or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from a known malicious region.
4. Conduct a forensic analysis on the targeted host (18.158.38.252) to assess any service degradation or compromise.
5. Update firewall and IDS signatures to include heuristic 20-based detection for future automated mitigation.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy class.
