Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many hosts send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this meets the threshold of 10+ ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one destination.
- Most likely heuristic: 20 (ICMP flood detection by volume and type).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.14.4, 157.17.100.216, 157.17.167.129, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 161.67.57.135.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests from multiple sources.
- Monitor the target host for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP echo replies on the target host if not required for legitimate operations.
