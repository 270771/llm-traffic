Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (column 17) shows mostly values other than 8 (echo request), with only two entries having ICMP type 8.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as ICMP smurf or fragmentation attacks, as no anomalies or excessive packet counts are evident.

No heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned due to lack of anomaly data.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 203.65.114.222 and 15.163.165.43 for any unusual behavior if ICMP traffic volume spikes.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
