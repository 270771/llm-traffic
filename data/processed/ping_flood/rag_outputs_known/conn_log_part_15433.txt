Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 16.160.194.189 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so the heuristic and taxonomy must be assigned based on standard knowledge: this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from the 130.197.x.x subnet (e.g., 130.197.63.49, 130.197.63.158, 130.197.157.16, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 16.160.194.189 with ICMP Echo Requests (port 8).
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host 16.160.194.189 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required.
