Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 161.67.57.135.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16 or more specific subnets based on further analysis).
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
