Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the same source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 1** (excessive ICMP Echo Requests), and the taxonomy class is **"ICMP Flood"** under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 163.252.44.194, 163.252.195.249, 163.252.29.193, 133.102.68.12, and others. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misconfiguration.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
