Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV shows anomalies related to TCP ports (e.g., 8080 with heuristic 10 for SYN attack) but no anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here. The anomalies present are categorized as 'ptmp' (heuristic 10, SYN attack) and 'mptmp' (heuristic 999, other), indicating other types of suspicious TCP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm if any ICMP traffic is filtered or logged elsewhere, as its absence here precludes ping flood detection.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack patterns (high SYN packets or suspicious TCP flags).  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' relates to partial TCP message patterns, consistent with SYN flood or scanning attempts.  

No ping flood attack is detected in the provided data.
