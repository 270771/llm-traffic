Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly 3, 8, or 11. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the legitimate ping request type.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the entire snippet (only one clear instance at timestamp 1641790826.463823).  
- The majority of ICMP traffic is type 3 (destination unreachable) or type 11 (time exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the 10-instance threshold.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly evident from the data, no immediate alert is warranted. However, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages could indicate network issues or scanning activity, which should be investigated further.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (203.65.114.222) to multiple destinations, which could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Investigate the cause of the numerous ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns for these IPs to detect anomalies more effectively.
