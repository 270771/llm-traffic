Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is indicated by the 11th column (ICMP type/code). The first entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply), and the second entry shows ICMP type 84, which is not type 8 (echo request).
- Since neither entry contains ICMP type 8, the fundamental condition for a ping flood (which requires ICMP echo requests) is not met.
- Additionally, there are only two ICMP connection entries, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other type of attack.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be confidently made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-volume or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP echo requests or related heuristics once data is available.
