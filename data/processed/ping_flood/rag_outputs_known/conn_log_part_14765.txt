Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries have types 3 and 8 respectively. Only the second entry (type 8) is an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- However, there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not indicated here).  
- The first entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

Anomaly and heuristic context:  
- The anomaly record references a suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42 but does not relate to ICMP type 8 or ping floods. It is categorized under heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp', which is unrelated to ping flood detection.  
- No heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics for ping flood are present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.153.194 sending ICMP type 3 messages to 45.136.197.42 for potential network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP to detect possible future ping flood attempts.  
- Review anomaly heuristic 999 for its relevance to other suspicious activities.

No ping flood attack is detected at this time.
