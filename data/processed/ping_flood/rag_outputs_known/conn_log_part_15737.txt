Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.22.191.77 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources targeting one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.7.70, 133.247.255.46, 133.247.131.209, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.22.191.77. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP 3.22.191.77 at the perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  3. Enable ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response if service degradation is observed.
