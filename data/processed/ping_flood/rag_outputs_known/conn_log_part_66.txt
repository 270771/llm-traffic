Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~3 seconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to various targets matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based flooding anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; Destination IPs include 23.209.11.5, 23.79.34.0, 198.76.129.7, 69.214.138.101, 60.83.213.247, 23.65.51.252, 23.71.168.4, 184.206.185.9, 2.209.216.252, 23.179.215.0, 23.230.134.4, 23.70.187.253, 23.241.65.253, 104.101.151.2, 104.115.54.4. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
  2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance caused by the flood.
  3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misconfiguration that may be causing the attack.
  4. Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to coordinate containment and remediation.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error."
