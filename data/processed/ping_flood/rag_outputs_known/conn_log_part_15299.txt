Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.
- The only anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic, not ICMP or ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks involving ICMP type 8 packets.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets and are unrelated to ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if any ICMP traffic is being filtered or logged elsewhere, as its absence here precludes ping flood detection.
