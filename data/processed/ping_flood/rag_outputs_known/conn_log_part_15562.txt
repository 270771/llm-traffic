Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and in fact, none are present in the snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes and investigate if future logs show repeated Echo Requests from the same source IPs.
