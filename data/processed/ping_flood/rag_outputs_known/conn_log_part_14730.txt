Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a volume or frequency indicative of flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from the source IP 52.237.221.62 to multiple destinations.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if the volume crosses the threshold or if heuristic 20 (if known) applies.  
- Investigate the source IP reputation and network behavior for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.
