Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the log entries are 0, 13, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP packets of types unrelated to ping floods (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 13 = Timestamp Request, type 1 = Destination Unreachable).

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if more extensive logs show repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
