Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8 and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classifications can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts to rule out emerging threats.
