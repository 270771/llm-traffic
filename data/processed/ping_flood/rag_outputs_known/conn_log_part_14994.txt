Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the snippet, there are only 3 instances where ICMP type 8 is present with the same destination IP (18.100.239.147), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (e.g., type 3 and 13) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 13 (timestamp request) is normal network behavior and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 192.179.223.249, 192.179.222.10, and 192.179.223.210 for any unusual activity if the volume of ICMP echo requests rises.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics if available.
