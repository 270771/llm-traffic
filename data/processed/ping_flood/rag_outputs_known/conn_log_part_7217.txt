Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 50.239.214.145 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood: numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly from many sources to a single target, overwhelming it.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is triggered by at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.166.49, 157.17.224.198, 157.17.196.149, etc.) flooding the destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 50.239.214.145.
- Monitor the target host for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
