Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3.
- Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- ICMP types 11 (time exceeded) and 3 (destination unreachable) are not related to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomalies are indicated, no immediate attack is present. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
