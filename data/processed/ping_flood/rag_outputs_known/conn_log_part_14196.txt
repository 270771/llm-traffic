Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.173.100.241) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any internal hosts are affected.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
