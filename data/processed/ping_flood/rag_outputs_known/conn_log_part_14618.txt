Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135 with ICMP Echo Requests on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent use of ICMP type 8 is critical.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.
