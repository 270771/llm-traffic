Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.1.80, 157.17.212.98, 157.17.172.177, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" as the most likely labels.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for service degradation or outages.
3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or spoofed IPs.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
5. Alert incident response team to investigate potential compromise or botnet involvement in the source IPs.
