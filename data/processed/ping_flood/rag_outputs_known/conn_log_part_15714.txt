Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total only 6 instances targeting 52.236.221.123, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No ICMP type other than 8 is involved in a suspicious volume, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known malicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The single ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) entry is unrelated to ping floods and does not indicate an attack.

Since no anomaly or heuristic data is available, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP to detect escalation.  
- Correlating with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.

No immediate security response is required based on this data alone.
