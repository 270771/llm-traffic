Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 13, 1, and 0. None of these are type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (in fact, none).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.
- ICMP type 13 is timestamp request, type 1 is destination unreachable, and type 0 is echo reply, none of which indicate a ping flood.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. The lack of ICMP echo requests (type 8) means this traffic does not match ping flood heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity, especially the ICMP unreachable and timestamp packets, which may indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.
- Collect more comprehensive logs including ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Apply heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume and type distribution once heuristic context is available.
