Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. Counting these entries, there are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a short time frame, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The presence of anomaly_314 in the anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious with an 'icmp_error' classification linked to heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to ping flood detection.
- The traffic pattern matches known ping flood behavior: a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly from a single source IP to multiple destinations, aiming to overwhelm network resources.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; multiple destination IPs including 195.53.157.135, 23.227.191.250, 72.248.66.0, 23.84.50.6, 104.67.159.4, 23.222.91.253, 23.81.105.252, 104.124.49.248, 104.65.154.2, 196.41.81.120.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here (type 8).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host associated with 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
3. Monitor network traffic for similar patterns from other IPs to detect potential distributed attacks.
4. Update IDS/IPS signatures to alert on excessive ICMP type 8 traffic matching heuristic 20.
5. Notify network operations and security teams to prepare for potential collateral impact and coordinate incident response.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and classified under the 'icmp_error' taxonomy class.
