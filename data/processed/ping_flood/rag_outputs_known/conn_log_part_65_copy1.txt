Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 4, 1, 0, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be miscellaneous ICMP messages (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 3 = Source Quench, type 4 = Redirect), which are normal network control messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP behavior or other suspicious activity in broader logs.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or volume spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood attempts.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
