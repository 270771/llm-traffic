Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP SYN traffic on port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs.
- Therefore, the traffic pattern aligns with a SYN flood or similar TCP-based attack, not an ICMP ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 flagged under heuristic 10 for SYN attack activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic separately to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if the SYN flood is causing service degradation and apply SYN flood mitigation techniques such as rate limiting or SYN cookies.

Heuristic and taxonomy summary:
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack (TCP SYN flood)
- Heuristic 20: Ping flood (ICMP Echo Request flood)
- Current anomalies match heuristic 10, not 20, so no ping flood is detected.
