Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic if unusual patterns emerge.
