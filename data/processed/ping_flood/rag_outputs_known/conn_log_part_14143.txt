Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.231.100.178) within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.44.18, 133.247.170.55, 133.247.72.65, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 3.231.100.178.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
