Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from diverse sources to a single destination.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs are multiple (e.g., 157.17.44.80, 157.17.235.180, 157.17.137.140, etc.), destination IP is 52.236.221.123, ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), port fields are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar floods.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
