Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in all entries is 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping), but there are only 3 instancesâ€”well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other sources to detect potential escalation. Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.
