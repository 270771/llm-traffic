Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.8.91.205) within a very short time window (~0.005 seconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs targeting one destination IP in rapid succession.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.67.185, 157.161.254.52, 157.161.91.215, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 69.8.91.205. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 69.8.91.205.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP floods or other volumetric attacks.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
  5. Ensure the target host has appropriate ICMP flood mitigation configured (e.g., ICMP rate limiting, firewall rules).

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, ICMP type, and distribution of source IPs targeting a single victim IP.
