Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 54.23.202.254 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. Specifically, there are at least 12 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting 54.23.202.254, satisfying the threshold of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets for ping flood detection.
- The pattern of many sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to one destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the heuristic of "multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination" indicating a ping flood. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.150.35, 157.17.158.161, 157.17.2.198, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.23.202.254 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.23.202.254.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for possible coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
