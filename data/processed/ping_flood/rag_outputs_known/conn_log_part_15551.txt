Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP SYN traffic on port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs.
- The taxonomy class for heuristic 10 is "ptmp" (partial TCP message pattern), indicating SYN flood or similar TCP-based DoS attempts.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged by anomaly_782 for potential SYN flood activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.
- Confirm if the SYN flood is causing service degradation and apply SYN flood mitigation techniques if needed (e.g., rate limiting, SYN cookies).

No ping flood is detected; the current anomaly aligns with a SYN flood attack (heuristic 10, taxonomy "ptmp").
