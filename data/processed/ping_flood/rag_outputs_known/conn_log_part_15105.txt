Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 13.86.47.233 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP from multiple sources.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 13.86.47.233; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP but logged as 0.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 13.86.47.233 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy network-based anomaly detection to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking sources if they are confirmed malicious.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the flood upstream if attack volume escalates.
