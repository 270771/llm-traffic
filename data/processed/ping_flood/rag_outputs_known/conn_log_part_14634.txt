Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in any anomaly records.  
- The anomalies present relate to TCP traffic on suspicious ports (heuristics 10 and 999), indicating SYN flood or other TCP-based anomalies, not ICMP-based attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).  
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to other or unknown anomalies on unusual ports.  
- The anomalies labeled as 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' relate to partial or multiple partial TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the suspicious TCP SYN anomalies further, especially those involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 and destination IP 45.136.197.42 on port 46280, as these may indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible ping floods.
