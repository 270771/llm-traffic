Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries; the ICMP type field is not explicitly listed, but the presence of ICMP traffic alone is insufficient without type 8.  
- The number of ICMP connections is very low (1, 58, and 1 packets respectively), and none meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the packet count rule.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connection states are OTH (other), and no unusual port or protocol behavior is evident.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic further by extracting ICMP type fields explicitly from packet captures or logs to confirm the absence of type 8 packets.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or volume spikes from these IPs.  
- If heuristic context becomes available, cross-reference IPs for known suspicious behavior.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
