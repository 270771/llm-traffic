Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 8th field after the timestamp and UID, which corresponds to the ICMP type. The entries show ICMP types 11 and 3, not 8.  
- ICMP type 8 is Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood. Since none of the entries have ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or scanning activity.
