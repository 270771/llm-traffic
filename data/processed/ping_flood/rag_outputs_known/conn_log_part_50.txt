Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 143.224.65.254 to multiple destination IPs in the 163.210.95.x range, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping floods, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are explicitly listed in the anomaly CSV, but heuristic 20 is defined as "Ping flood" in the heuristic context.
- The anomaly taxonomy class relevant here is "icmp_error" under the "Other" category, consistent with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.65.254; Destination IPs 163.210.95.92 through 163.210.95.127 (multiple hosts).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 143.224.65.254 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor the affected destination IP range 163.210.95.92-163.210.95.127 for service degradation or packet loss.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if 143.224.65.254 is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS for early detection of similar attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.

Heuristic assigned: 20 (Ping flood)  
Taxonomy class: "icmp_error" (Other category)
