Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 and 0, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies or heuristic matches.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in volume.
