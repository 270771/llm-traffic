Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomalies or heuristic matches are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination to detect potential escalation into a ping flood. Collect more connection logs to identify patterns over time.
