Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.238.213.5, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where many ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches are explicitly provided, but by default, this fits heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniform ICMP type.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.238.213.5. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.238.213.5. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.228.0.0/16. Conduct further network forensics to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists.
