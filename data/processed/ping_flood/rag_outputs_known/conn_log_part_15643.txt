Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker sends numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify network operations to prepare for potential collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected network segments.
