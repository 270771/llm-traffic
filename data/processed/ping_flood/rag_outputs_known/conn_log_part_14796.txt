Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if a pattern emerges that meets the ping flood criteria.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.
