Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values of 3 or 11, except two entries with type 3 and one with type 11. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood, is not present in any of the log entries.  
- The rule states that if ICMP type is not 8, it is not a ping flood. Here, no ICMP type 8 packets are observed.  
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context provided to suggest otherwise or indicate known suspicious IPs related to heuristic 20.  
- The traffic appears to be ICMP error messages (type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded), which are normal network control messages and not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP error messages could be investigated further if they appear in unusual volumes or patterns, but based on the current snippet, no attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the volume of ICMP error messages (type 3 and 11) is abnormally high over a longer period, which could indicate network issues or other anomalies.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to identify any suspicious activity.
