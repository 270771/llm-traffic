Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is logged here.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic context states that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 must be present unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies are detected. No such anomalies or matching IPs are found in the anomaly CSV.  
- The only anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by monitoring source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Collect ICMP traffic logs to verify if any ping flood attempts occur later.  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect any future ping flood attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' indicates partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood behavior.  

No ping flood is detected in the current data.
