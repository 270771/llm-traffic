Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (68.104.133.69), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to classify this as a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate pings or low-volume scanning.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume from these or other sources to the same destination IP. Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity or if the destination IP is critical infrastructure that should not receive unsolicited pings. If anomaly data or heuristics become available, re-evaluate accordingly.
