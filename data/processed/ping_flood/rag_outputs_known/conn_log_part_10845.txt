Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating no established or ongoing flood pattern.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs flagged by heuristics, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.247.49.34) to the destination (202.87.55.201). If counts rise above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
