Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP: Source 13.242.241.56, Destinations include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses, all using ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the Echo Request.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if they are legitimate hosts.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS systems.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack at source.
