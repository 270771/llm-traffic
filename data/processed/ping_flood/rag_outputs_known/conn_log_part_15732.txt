Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 95.182.58.120 to destination 202.194.9.13, but there is only 1 instance recorded, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IP 95.182.58.120 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests at higher volumes.
