Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.90).
- The other entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack pattern is evident from the data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any new anomaly records appear related to these IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern emerges.
