Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. Since the ICMP type is not 8 and there are fewer than 10 instances, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or repeated ICMP traffic from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future attacks.
