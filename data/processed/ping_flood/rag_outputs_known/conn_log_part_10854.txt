Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 128, 8, and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only two instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP types 128 (Echo Reply) and 0 (Echo Reply in some ICMP versions) does not imply flooding or other attacks here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
