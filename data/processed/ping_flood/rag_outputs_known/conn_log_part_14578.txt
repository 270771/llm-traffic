Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. Since the ICMP type is not 8 and fewer than 10 instances exist, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network operations.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or repeated ICMP traffic from this or other IPs could be prudent to detect future ping flood attempts.
