Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly provided as type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved (none are found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail if available, to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
