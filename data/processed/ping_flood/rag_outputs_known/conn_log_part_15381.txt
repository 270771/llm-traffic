Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection. However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic visible, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP type present is 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The lack of anomaly records and heuristic context means no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 further if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests, as it appears multiple times here.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out a ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
