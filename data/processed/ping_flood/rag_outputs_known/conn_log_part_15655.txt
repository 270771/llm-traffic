Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 35.169.51.96 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here. The taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.54.214, 157.17.185.2, 157.17.61.58, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. If possible, temporarily block or blacklist the identified source IPs until the attack subsides.
