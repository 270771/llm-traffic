Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection by volume and type) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.228.4.24. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.228.4.24.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services hosted on 54.228.4.24.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
  5. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation or further attack vectors.
