Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from source IP 133.16.14.149 targeting multiple destination IPs. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a high volume of ping requests consistent with a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies heuristic 20 as "Ping flood" and associates it with the anomaly record for source IP 133.16.14.149 categorized as 'icmp_error'. This matches the observed traffic pattern.
- The involved IP addresses are mainly source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to various destination IPs such as 23.245.14.3, 23.71.177.254, 23.231.225.248, 23.225.105.250, 184.206.168.2, 2.209.217.252, 23.179.213.252, 165.1.164.80, 23.189.103.253, 184.165.33.3, 104.115.104.91, and 104.68.134.4.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic and the OTH (other) state flags confirm non-standard connection behavior typical of flooding.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance caused by the flood.
3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misconfiguration that may be causing the ping flood.
4. Correlate with other logs and alerts to detect if this is part of a larger distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and falls under the "icmp_error" taxonomy class, indicating anomalous ICMP traffic consistent with denial-of-service behavior.
