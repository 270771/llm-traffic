Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.36.162.241).
- All entries have ICMP type 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances exceeds the threshold of 10, indicating a high volume of echo requests.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are simultaneously sending ICMP echo requests to the same destination IP, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) by default, but since no anomaly data is found, we assign heuristic 10: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests indicating potential ping flood."
- Taxonomy class: "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.38.10 through 133.247.72.101 (at least 20 unique IPs).
- Destination IP: 18.36.162.241.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the destination host (18.36.162.241) for service degradation or outages.
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering.
6. Review and update incident response plans to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
