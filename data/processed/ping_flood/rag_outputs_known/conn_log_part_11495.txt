Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating predominantly from IP 18.112.90.42 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, and no heuristic context is provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets (more than 10) from a single source IP to multiple destinations strongly indicates heuristic #1 (ICMP flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.112.90.42 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to multiple destination IPs including 203.78.177.220, 203.78.176.174, 203.78.189.230, 203.78.179.49, 203.78.176.243, 203.78.176.216, 203.78.179.217, 203.78.187.167, 203.78.170.82, 203.78.191.180, 203.78.179.82, 203.78.190.195, 203.78.190.240.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.112.90.42 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting on affected destination hosts to mitigate impact.
- Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
