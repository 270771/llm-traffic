Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 35.127.34.186 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.37.158, 133.247.180.158, 133.247.37.220, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.127.34.186 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor the target host 35.127.34.186 for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.
4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are known malicious.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential botnet involvement and coordinate remediation.
