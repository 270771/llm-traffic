Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 is "Timestamp Request," which do not match typical flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related connection logs for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
