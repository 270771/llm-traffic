Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.184.243.206) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.134.146, 133.247.134.51, 133.247.110.20, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.184.243.206. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  3. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation such as blackholing or scrubbing services.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or botnet involvement and initiate incident response procedures.
