Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.61.16.153) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.98.102, 157.17.105.10, 157.17.196.150) all targeting destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 44.61.16.153.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and affected stakeholders to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
