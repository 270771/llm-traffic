Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (the 10th column in Zeek conn.log) shows mostly 0 or 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping). Since none of the entries have ICMP type 8, these are not ping requests.  
- There are no at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to one or multiple destinations).  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack type can be confidently identified. The ICMP types 0 and 3 correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable, respectively, which may be normal or related to other network conditions but not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity or other protocols if suspicious behavior continues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other anomalies.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
