Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of either 0, 3, or 11 (as indicated in the 8th field), but none show ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request (ping) packets.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would override this.  
- The traffic appears to be miscellaneous ICMP messages (e.g., type 3 = destination unreachable, type 11 = time exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP traffic may be normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity patterns or volume over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
