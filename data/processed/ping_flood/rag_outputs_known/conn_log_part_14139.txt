Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.231.100.178, which matches the requirement of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied within the 133.247.x.x range, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches a classic ICMP Echo Request flood (heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP floods).
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.253.176, 133.247.163.213, 133.247.231.178, etc.) targeting destination 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the victim host (3.231.100.178) for service degradation or availability issues.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking sources if mitigation at the firewall is insufficient.
- Notify upstream providers if attack volume escalates to coordinate broader mitigation.
