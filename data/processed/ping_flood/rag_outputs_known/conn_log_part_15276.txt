Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  

No further action specific to ping flood is needed. However, ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) can indicate network issues or other conditions worth monitoring. Investigate the cause of these ICMP messages if unusual volumes or patterns emerge.
