Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other suspicious multi-port traffic, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 is an unspecified or other anomaly.
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or ping flood heuristic 20 is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood indicated by heuristic 10 anomaly_782 (source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080).
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if the suspicious SYN traffic is causing service degradation or denial of service.

No ping flood attack is detected at this time.
