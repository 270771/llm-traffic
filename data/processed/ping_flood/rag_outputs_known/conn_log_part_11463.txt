Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.181.17.215.
- There are at least 15 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and destination IP 52.181.17.215. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 52.181.17.215.
  4. Consider blacklisting persistent attacking IPs and investigate upstream providers for possible mitigation.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
