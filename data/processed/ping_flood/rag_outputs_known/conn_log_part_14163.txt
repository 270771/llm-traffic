Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.220.233.141 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time frame, targeting many different destination IPs, matches known ping flood patterns where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; Destination IPs include 163.252.50.1, 163.252.50.2, 163.252.145.254, 163.252.38.198, 163.252.239.41, 163.252.239.175, 163.252.239.179, 163.252.50.30, 163.252.247.142, 163.252.77.1, 163.252.180.92.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
