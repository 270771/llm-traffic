Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward the same destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "ICMP Echo Request flood detected").
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.124.3, 133.228.78.57, 133.228.151.167, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 3.83.92.175 for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Engage upstream providers or internal network teams to trace and mitigate the source of the flood.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Consider temporary blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are external and non-critical.
- Conduct a post-incident review to update firewall and network policies to prevent recurrence.
