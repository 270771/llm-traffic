Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 11, not 8. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, which are typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 messages could be considered if network issues arise.
