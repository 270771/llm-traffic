Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 3, 8, and other types, but only two instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) are observed, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid repetition of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 packets (destination unreachable) may indicate normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
