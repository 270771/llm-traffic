Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly noted (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, which is a TCP SYN flood pattern, not ICMP ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets on well-known or suspicious ports.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN flood anomaly further by analyzing TCP SYN packet rates and source IP behavior for potential DoS mitigation.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks, as current data lacks ICMP traffic.
