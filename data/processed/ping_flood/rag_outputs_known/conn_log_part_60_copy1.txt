Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 3, 8, 10, and 11. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641790964.978696), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood.
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found.
- The majority of ICMP traffic is type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood but could relate to network scanning or routing issues.

Since no ping flood is detected and no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to determine if there is a network misconfiguration or another form of reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempt.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that might indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
