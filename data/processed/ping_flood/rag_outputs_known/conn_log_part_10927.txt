Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which typically corresponds to heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.80.126.221 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 8 (ICMP type) in the log.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.80.126.221 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
