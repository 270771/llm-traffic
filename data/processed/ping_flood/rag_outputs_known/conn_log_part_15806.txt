Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests distributed across different destination IPs, without signs of overwhelming volume or repeated targeting.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 52.236.221.123.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if the pattern escalates to a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.  
- Investigate the source IP if it continues to send multiple ICMP requests to various destinations in a short time frame.
