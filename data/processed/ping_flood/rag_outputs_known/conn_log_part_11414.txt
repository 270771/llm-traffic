Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.76.138 to multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the flooding nature.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; Destination IPs include 163.252.182.249, 163.252.24.224, 163.252.101.198, 163.252.24.211, 163.252.165.1, 163.252.187.72, 163.252.143.249, 163.252.187.253, 163.252.186.109, 163.252.143.181, 163.252.159.95, 163.252.186.86, 163.252.186.3, 163.252.159.94, 163.252.8.185, 163.252.8.175, 163.252.204.185, 163.252.100.254, 163.252.5.203.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources of similar ICMP floods.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
6. Review and update incident response playbooks to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
