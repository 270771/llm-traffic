Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 messages could indicate network issues or misconfigurations worth monitoring.
