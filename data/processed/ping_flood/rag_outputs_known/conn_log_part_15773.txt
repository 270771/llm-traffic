Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.169.51.96 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources including 133.247.142.68, 133.247.49.41, 133.247.142.212, 133.247.142.70, 133.247.49.28, 133.247.95.236, 133.247.95.233, all targeting destination 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to detect possible coordinated attacks.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts among the source IPs.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to automatically block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  5. If possible, temporarily disable ICMP echo replies on the target host to mitigate impact.
