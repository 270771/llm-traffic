Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 or multiple repeated requests, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 0 packets correspond to legitimate responses or other network activity.
