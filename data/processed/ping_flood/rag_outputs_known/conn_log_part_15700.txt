Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (indicated by the ICMP code field "3" in the log), which is not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods require multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10 instances) and no such packets are present, this does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 3 typically indicates a destination unreachable message, which is normal network behavior rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP could be a next step if suspicious activity increases.
