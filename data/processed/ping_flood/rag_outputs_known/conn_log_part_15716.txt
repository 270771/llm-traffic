Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- The source IPs are multiple and varied (e.g., 133.228.187.193, 133.228.164.219, 133.228.147.255, etc.), indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests flooding a target) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.236.221.123.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases.
