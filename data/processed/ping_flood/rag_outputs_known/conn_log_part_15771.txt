Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099675.5). This matches the classic pattern of a ping flood where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.177.202, 133.247.180.3, 133.247.106.36, etc.) are flooding ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (35.169.51.96) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking IPs.
  4. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly.
  5. Prepare incident response to mitigate impact and collect forensic data for potential attribution.
