Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the IP 50.239.214.145 from many different source IPs, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood: numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly from multiple sources to a single destination IP.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources such as 133.228.168.106, 133.228.243.193, 52.230.228.52, and others targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the instruction referencing heuristic 20 for known anomalous IPs), which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 50.239.214.145.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs generating excessive ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
