Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets, not ICMP echo requests.  
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or repeated ICMP type 8 packets reaching the threshold of 10 instances is found.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 further, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP echo requests outside this snippet.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected; the current anomaly relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10), which targets TCP connection establishment rather than ICMP.
