Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries, the total count of such instances is fewer than 10 (only 8 entries with type 8 are present). Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are identified, and no anomaly records are found in the provided CSV. The presence of other ICMP types (e.g., type 3) further indicates normal ICMP traffic rather than a focused ping flood.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests exceeding the threshold of 10 within a short time frame, and correlate with any anomaly records or heuristic matches if they become available. Investigate the source IPs sending repeated ICMP echo requests if their volume rises or if network performance issues are observed.
