Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.229.78.71.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
  3. Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
