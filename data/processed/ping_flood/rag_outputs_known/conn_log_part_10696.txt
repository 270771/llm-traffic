Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although there are multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request), the total count of such packets is exactly 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the provided CSV.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made at this time.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume, especially if it reaches or exceeds 10 packets from the same or multiple sources targeting a single destination. Investigate the source IPs (157.17.x.x range) sending ICMP Echo Requests to 54.206.231.130 for any unusual behavior or correlation with other alerts.
