Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 22 ICMP connections from source IP 163.76.120.97 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood attack, which fits this scenario perfectly.
- No anomalies in the provided anomaly CSV match these IPs or ports, but the heuristic 20 is the most appropriate classification here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.76.120.97 is the attacker; multiple destination IPs include 203.65.116.190, 203.65.118.82, 163.21.190.223, 203.65.116.65, 163.21.220.3, 202.44.240.8, and others.
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or other sources.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy class: Ping Flood).
