Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.34.186) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple unique source IPs (e.g., 133.247.136.207, 133.247.34.244, 133.247.35.138, etc.) are sending these requests, indicating a distributed or coordinated flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the consistent use of ICMP type 8 is critical.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle excessive ICMP traffic targeting 35.127.34.186.
- Identify and block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood (e.g., 133.247.136.207, 133.247.34.244, etc.) using access control lists (ACLs).
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential escalation.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume increases.
