Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to overwhelming ICMP Echo Requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.104.200, 157.17.166.11, 157.17.28.205, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) targeting 44.61.16.153.
  2. Deploy network-level filtering (e.g., firewall rules or intrusion prevention system signatures) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood traffic.
  3. Monitor the affected host and network for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
