Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 13. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present (from 133.247.23.85 to 3.116.11.97).  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = destination unreachable, 13 = timestamp request) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect heuristic 20 or similar patterns.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
