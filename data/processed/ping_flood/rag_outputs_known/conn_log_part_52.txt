Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.16.14.149 and others, with at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets observed, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based flooding attacks.
- Involved IP addresses include source IP 133.16.14.149 targeting multiple destination IPs (e.g., 23.212.208.7, 204.108.95.7, 23.208.170.5, 104.75.142.4, 23.95.233.248, etc.) on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic and the anomaly heuristic 20 confirm the ping flood.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for additional ICMP flood traffic from other IPs such as 143.224.65.254 and 161.250.198.224, which also show multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other hosts generating excessive ICMP Echo Requests to prevent lateral spread.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misuse.
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error," confirming a classic ICMP Echo Request flood aimed at overwhelming target hosts.
