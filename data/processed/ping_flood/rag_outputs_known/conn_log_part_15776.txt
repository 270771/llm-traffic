Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; all anomalies are related to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter).
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets, absent here.

Other attack types:
- The anomalies detected correspond to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999).
- SYN attacks (heuristic 10) indicate TCP SYN flood attempts, consistent with many S0 (SYN sent, no response) TCP flags in the logs.
- Heavy hitter (heuristic 999) indicates high-volume suspicious traffic on unknown ports.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs flagged under heuristic 10 (e.g., 89.3.89.164 on port 8080) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is present; the current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (10) and heavy hitter behavior (999). Further investigation should focus on TCP SYN flood mitigation and traffic volume analysis.
