Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from source IP 35.183.65.24 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, consistent with a high volume of echo requests typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets without known exceptions.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily source 35.183.65.24 and destination IPs including 163.252.192.70, 163.252.244.124, 163.252.237.219, and others in the 163.252.x.x subnet. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if attack volume increases.
