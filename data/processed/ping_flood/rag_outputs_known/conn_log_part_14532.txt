Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries targeting 69.47.68.48 are present but only 7 instances are visible in the snippet (from IPs 133.247.148.22, 133.247.136.197, 133.247.137.238, 133.247.82.175, 133.247.35.69, 133.247.107.195, and one more).
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- Other ICMP types (1 and 3) are present but do not indicate ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports.
- The traffic pattern does not match a volumetric ping flood attack but could be normal ICMP echo requests or scanning activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet volume to the same destination IP.
- Investigate if 69.47.68.48 is a critical asset and if these ICMP requests are expected.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data for heuristic 20 or other known attack signatures.
