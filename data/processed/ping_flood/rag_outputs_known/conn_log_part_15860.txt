Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs (all in the 157.17.x.x range) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.228.4.24 within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts overwhelm a target with echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.17.0.0/16) to 54.228.4.24.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated DDoS activity.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify affected parties and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or outage.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 54.228.4.24, consistent with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
