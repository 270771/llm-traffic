Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.75.118 to destination 35.127.18.10, but there is only one such instance in the snippet, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 133.228.62.234 to 143.9.245.2) has ICMP type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type or suspicious behavior.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
