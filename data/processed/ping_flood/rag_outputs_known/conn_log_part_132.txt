Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume of ICMP type 8 packets exceeds the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the pattern of a ping flood.
- No anomalies from the anomaly CSV directly reference this source IP or destination IPs with heuristic 20, so the count threshold applies.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood attack, which matches this traffic pattern.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs including 163.21.223.32, 163.21.10.217, 203.65.126.49, 163.21.24.1, and others.
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on affected destination IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential collateral impact.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy class: Ping flood).
