Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here). No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 13 is typically benign and used for time synchronization.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP echo requests or if anomaly data becomes available.
