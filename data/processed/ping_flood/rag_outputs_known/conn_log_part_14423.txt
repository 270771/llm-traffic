Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign or normal ICMP probing.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (52.158.11.176) to the destination (163.252.70.146). If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time window, re-evaluate for ping flood activity. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
