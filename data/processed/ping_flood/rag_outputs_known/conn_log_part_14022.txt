Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry has type 11, which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The second ICMP entry has type 8, but there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if repeated echo requests occur in bursts indicative of a ping flood.
