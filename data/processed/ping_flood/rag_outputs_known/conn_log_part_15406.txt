Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 1 (indicated by the "1" in the 4th and 6th fields for ICMP type/code), which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if any other unusual traffic patterns emerge involving these IPs.
