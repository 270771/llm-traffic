Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, which is a prerequisite for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.88.59, 133.228.160.250, 133.228.214.62, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block the attack traffic closer to the source.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and remediate accordingly.
