Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and no unusual flags or volume are evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without additional evidence or anomalies, this traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in future anomaly records or if heuristic 20 (if known) applies once context is available.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
