Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.158.38.252. This satisfies the condition of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a flood of ping requests.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_53) involving destination IP 18.158.38.252 categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class for this anomaly is 'ntscICecrqICecrprp', which falls under the NetworkScanICMP category, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic and heuristic 20 confirm the ping flood classification.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.158.38.252.
2. Investigate the source IPs (157.161.x.x range) for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
3. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability of 18.158.38.252.
4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
5. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps, including blackholing traffic if necessary.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy.
