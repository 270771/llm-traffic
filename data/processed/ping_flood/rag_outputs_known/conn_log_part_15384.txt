Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is represented by the 7th column ("icmp") and the ICMP code/type is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The entries show ICMP traffic, but none indicate ICMP type 8. For example, the 4th and 10th columns (which often represent ICMP type and code) show values like 3, 13, 0, and 0, none of which correspond to ICMP type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are present to override this threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP messages such as destination unreachable (type 3) or timestamp requests (type 13), which are common in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and volume spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
