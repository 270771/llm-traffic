Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have a count of 1 or 0 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request). Specifically, the last field in Zeek conn.log typically indicates ICMP type or count; here, the values are 1, 58, and 1, but without explicit ICMP type 8 confirmation or multiple repeated echo requests from the same source, this does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.
- The traffic shows isolated ICMP packets with no evidence of flooding or repeated echo requests.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) state and flags do not suggest a TCP/UDP flood or other protocol misuse.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.
- Investigate the IP 200.205.147.145 and 193.58.96.249 if they repeatedly appear in ICMP traffic to rule out reconnaissance or scanning activity.
