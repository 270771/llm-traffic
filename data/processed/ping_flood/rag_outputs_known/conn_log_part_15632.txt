Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connection attempts from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.79.221, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.79.254, 163.252.233.40, and others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
