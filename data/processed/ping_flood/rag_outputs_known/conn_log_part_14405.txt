Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the conn.log snippet does not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods.  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic but with no type 8 indicated, and only 1 instance is logged.  
- The second entry shows 58 ICMP packets but no explicit ICMP type 8, and the connection state is OTH (other), which does not confirm a ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.  
- Without at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or matching heuristics, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The OTH state and ICMP traffic could be normal or benign network activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail if available to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data or heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
