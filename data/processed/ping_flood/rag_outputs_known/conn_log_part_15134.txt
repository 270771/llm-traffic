Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve abnormal SYN packets, not ICMP traffic.  
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or repeated ICMP type 8 packets reaching the threshold of 10 instances is found.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm if any other logs capture ICMP packets to rule out ping flood attempts.

Conclusion: No ping flood attack is present; the current anomaly relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10, taxonomy class "SYN attack").
