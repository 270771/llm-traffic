Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 20 ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods. These requests originate predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 targeting multiple destination IPs, indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 (attacker), multiple destination IPs including 2.209.107.248, 104.67.117.253, 184.167.74.1, 104.109.226.5, 23.245.2.3, and others. Ports are ICMP (no port numbers).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential amplification or distributed attacks.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host and isolate it if necessary.
  4. Implement ICMP rate limiting on critical infrastructure to mitigate impact.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar ICMP flood attacks in the future.

This detection is confident due to the volume of ICMP type 8 packets and the direct match to heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") with taxonomy "icmp_error."
