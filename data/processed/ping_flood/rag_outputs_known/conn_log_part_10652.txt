Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.116.11.97) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks, as ICMP ping floods aim to exhaust network resources.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 61.1.51.193, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host (3.116.11.97) for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting persistent attacking IPs and investigate upstream providers for source IP remediation.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to drop excessive ICMP traffic and prevent amplification.
