Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099665.16). This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.30.111, 133.247.50.189, 133.247.180.5, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting the victim IP.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet or spoofed addresses.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 157.187.159.183 and prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IP ranges if the attack volume persists.
