Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags suspicious ICMP echo request floods.
- The involved IP addresses are source IP 35.183.65.24 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP for potential wider mitigation.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting in IDS/IPS systems to catch similar future events.
  5. Review internal network devices for any signs of impact or compromise due to this flood.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, type, and pattern of traffic observed.
