Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), so this traffic could be ping-related.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified in the data.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and the flags do not indicate abnormal flooding behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other security systems or threat intelligence feeds.
