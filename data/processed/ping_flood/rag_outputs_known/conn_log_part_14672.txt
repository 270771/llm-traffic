Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 210.122.60.24 to destination 69.47.68.48, with a single instance recorded.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 0 (Echo Reply) from 62.115.4.145 to 133.251.232.10.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential volumetric ICMP floods.  
- Investigate any IPs that repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.
