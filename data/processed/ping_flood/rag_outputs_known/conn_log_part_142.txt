Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 13.248.91.214 to destination 203.65.103.15, and there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet.
- All other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not indicate ping flood activity.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 anomalies are present, which are not found here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports are flagged.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network scanning or routing issues but not a flooding attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.
- Investigate the cause of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to rule out misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
