Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of either 0, 3, or 11, but none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs that would override the type 8 requirement.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from 203.65.114.222 or other sources.
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correspond to legitimate network issues or misconfigurations.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
