Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 and a few from 157.78.x.x addresses, targeting multiple destination IPs. This volume and pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets matches the known ping flood pattern, where an attacker sends numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Source IP: 133.16.14.149 (primary attacker)
  - Other sources: 157.78.69.33, 157.78.78.187, 133.16.64.249 (also sending ICMP type 8 or type 1)
  - Multiple destination IPs across different networks, indicating a broad scanning or flooding attempt.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor for similar ICMP traffic from other suspicious IPs in the 157.78.x.x and 133.16.x.x ranges.
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules on network devices to prevent service degradation.
4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the compromised host at 133.16.14.149 to identify infection or misuse.
5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attacks.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and classified under the "icmp_error" taxonomy.
