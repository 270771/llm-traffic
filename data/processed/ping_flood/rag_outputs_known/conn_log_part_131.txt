Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack. Assigning heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate based on standard cybersecurity taxonomies.
- Involved IP: Source IP 124.121.97.181 is the attacker; multiple destination IPs (e.g., 203.65.100.58, 163.21.220.30, 203.65.113.96, etc.) are potential victims. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected parties and update incident response documentation accordingly.
