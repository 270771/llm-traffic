Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs, notably 54.229.78.71 and 52.239.218.32, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.247.28.176, 133.247.242.216, 192.179.223.212) are sending these echo requests, suggesting a distributed pattern typical of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.247.28.176, 133.247.242.216, 192.179.223.212, 192.179.222.33, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 54.229.78.71 and 52.239.218.32
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting persistent offending source IPs at firewall or router level.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases.
