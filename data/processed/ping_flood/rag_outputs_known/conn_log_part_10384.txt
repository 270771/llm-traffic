Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.22.151.10, consistent with a ping flood pattern where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.67.57, 133.247.229.48, 133.247.65.28, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.22.151.10 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor and log further ICMP traffic to detect escalation or new source IPs.
- Consider blacklisting persistent attacking IPs and alert network operations for potential upstream mitigation.
- Verify the target host 18.22.151.10 for service availability and readiness to handle DoS conditions.
