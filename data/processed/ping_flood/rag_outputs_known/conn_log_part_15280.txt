Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.130.188.37 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.130.188.37; Destination IPs include 203.78.186.195, 203.78.178.104, 203.78.184.33, 203.78.148.101, 203.78.148.105, 203.78.178.242, 203.78.170.82, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.171.214, 203.78.179.90, 203.78.184.1, 203.78.184.183, 203.78.187.176.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.130.188.37 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of service degradation or outages caused by this traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with DoS protection.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential impact or coordinate mitigation.
