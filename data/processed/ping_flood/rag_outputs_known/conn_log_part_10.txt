Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 and also from 129.43.86.1, targeting multiple destination IPs. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a high volume of ping requests consistent with a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 129.43.86.1
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 3.107.14.9, 173.41.184.0, 23.65.238.3, 184.203.165.9, 184.206.107.251, 185.221.201.206, 2.208.22.4, 203.114.237.248-255 range, among others.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic and the volume confirm the attack pattern.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 and 129.43.86.1 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Block or throttle ICMP traffic from these IPs to prevent network resource exhaustion.
3. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attacks.
6. Update IDS/IPS signatures to detect similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the taxonomy class "icmp_error," confirming a classic ICMP Echo Request flood DoS attack.
