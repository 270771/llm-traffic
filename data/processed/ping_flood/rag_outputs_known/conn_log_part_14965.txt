Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8, but only two instances are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which does not qualify as a ping flood packet type.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only one instance is present, insufficient to confirm flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more connection logs to identify if the volume of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.181.114.142 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests without replies, as it may indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity.
