Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the given data, no immediate security response is required. However, further monitoring of ICMP traffic for type 8 packets and volume spikes is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
