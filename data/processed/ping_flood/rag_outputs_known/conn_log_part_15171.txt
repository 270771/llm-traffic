Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.44.165.118 within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641099670.68x). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP without known exceptions. This log clearly exceeds that threshold.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.44.165.118 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 34.44.165.118 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and consider upstream provider coordination to block malicious traffic.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
