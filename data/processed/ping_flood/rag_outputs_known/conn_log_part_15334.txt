Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type 3 (code 1) message, which is a "Destination Unreachable" response, not an ICMP Echo Request (type 8) used in ping floods. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
