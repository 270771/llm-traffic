Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 44.61.26.217 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.61.26.217. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.61.26.217.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block the attacking source IP ranges if possible.
  3. Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
