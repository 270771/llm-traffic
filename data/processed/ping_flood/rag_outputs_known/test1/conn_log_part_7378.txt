Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 50.239.214.145. This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic, which typically corresponds to heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) in common anomaly taxonomies.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.127.253, 133.228.214.254, 133.228.23.166, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 50.239.214.145.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other network logs for signs of coordinated attack.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation escalation if the attack persists.
