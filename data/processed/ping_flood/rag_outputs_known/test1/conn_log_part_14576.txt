Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only two ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entries are type 0 or other types, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries appear to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a volumetric flood.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the involved IPs (192.178.71.64, 157.17.48.98) to the respective destinations. If the count exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity or known threat intelligence.
