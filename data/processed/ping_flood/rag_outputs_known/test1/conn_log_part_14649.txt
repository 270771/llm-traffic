Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 157.17.0.0/16 range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 157.17.0.0/16.
  2. Monitor the target host 52.237.221.62 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
