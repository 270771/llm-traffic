Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one outlier 203.78.180.228 (which is ICMP type 0, not relevant here), all targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.237.221.62.
- Monitor the target host for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the most aggressive source IPs if the attack persists.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
