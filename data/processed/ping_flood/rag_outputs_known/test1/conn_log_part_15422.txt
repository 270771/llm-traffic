Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.193.126.151 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume (â‰¥10 instances) meets the threshold for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source 54.193.126.151 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 133.251.x.x range, all on ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.
- Recommended response: Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.193.126.151 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood. Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic. Conduct further investigation on the source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent. Consider alerting upstream providers if attack persists.
