Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the 11th column (ICMP type/code). Here, the values are 84 and "-" (missing) which do not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP traffic with no flood pattern or known anomaly.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any future entries with ICMP type 8 counts exceeding 10 or matching known suspicious IP heuristics.
