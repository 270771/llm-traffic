Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection by volume and type) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.228.4.24. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.228.4.24. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to block or throttle excessive ICMP type 8 traffic. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate. Monitor for collateral impact and prepare to escalate to upstream providers if attack volume increases.
