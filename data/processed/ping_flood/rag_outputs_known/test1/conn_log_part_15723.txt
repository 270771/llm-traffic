Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 133.228.160.250 and 133.228.79.184). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present are 0 and 11, which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply an attack here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity once anomaly data or heuristics become available.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
