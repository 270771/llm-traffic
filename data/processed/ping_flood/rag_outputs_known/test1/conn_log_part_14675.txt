Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs per heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log may not log ICMP by default.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or use packet capture tools to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for other anomalies or suspicious traffic patterns in other logs or network sensors.
