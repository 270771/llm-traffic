Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.30.218.60 from multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (known anomalous src/dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.143.232, 133.240.243.19, 133.240.179.31, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the target host 3.30.218.60 for service degradation and consider temporary isolation if impact is severe.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
