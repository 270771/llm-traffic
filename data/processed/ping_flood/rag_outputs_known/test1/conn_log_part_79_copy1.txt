Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97; Destination IPs include 163.21.208.46, 163.21.210.57, 203.65.116.167, and many others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation on destination IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IP is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate and contain the source of the attack.
