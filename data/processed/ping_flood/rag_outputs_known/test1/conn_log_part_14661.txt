Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the same destination IP 52.237.221.62 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 1: ICMP Echo Request flood) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 133.228.62.233 targeting destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential upstream sources and prepare for mitigation.
- Deploy or tune existing DoS protection mechanisms to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
