Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries; all records are TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious IPs or known ping flood heuristics.
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the logs, as most connections show typical TCP SYN attempts with no successful sessions or ICMP activity.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP echo request traffic and count occurrences to detect potential ping floods.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP type 8 or repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.
- Enable logging or alerts specifically for ICMP traffic to improve detection capability.
