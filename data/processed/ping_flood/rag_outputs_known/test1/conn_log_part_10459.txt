Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 157.17.231.174 to 44.61.16.153, but it appears only once.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.
