Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 128, 3, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 58.241.3.103 to 203.78.206.64). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The other ICMP types (128 = echo reply, 3 = destination unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 128 is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP echo request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- If anomalies appear, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
