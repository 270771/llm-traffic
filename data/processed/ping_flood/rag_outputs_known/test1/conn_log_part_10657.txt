Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present here. The ICMP type 3 message typically indicates normal network error reporting rather than an attack. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate investigation is warranted for ping flood or related ICMP attacks.
