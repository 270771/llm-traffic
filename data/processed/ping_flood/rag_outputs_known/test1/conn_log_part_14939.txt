Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x and 203.78.x.x ranges; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
