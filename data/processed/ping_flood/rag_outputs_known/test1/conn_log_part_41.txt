Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) from several source IPs, notably 13.22.70.201 and 133.16.14.149, sending repeated ICMP Echo Requests to various destination IPs within a very short time frame.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood detection.
- The pattern matches known ping flood behavior: rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming target hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs include sources: 13.22.70.201, 133.16.14.149, and destinations such as 163.210.170.22, 163.210.183.6, 23.91.142.4, among others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from identified source IPs (e.g., 13.22.70.201, 133.16.14.149) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
- Notify network operations to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misconfiguration.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
- Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
