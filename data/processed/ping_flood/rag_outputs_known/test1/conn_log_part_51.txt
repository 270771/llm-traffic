Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (143.224.65.254) sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where a host overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to identify ping floods. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the flooding nature of the traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.65.254 is the attacker; destination IPs range across 163.210.95.194 to 163.210.95.215. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 143.224.65.254 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
  3. Investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch recurrence early.
