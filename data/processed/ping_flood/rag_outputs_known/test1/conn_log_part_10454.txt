Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 within a very short time frame (~0 seconds difference in timestamps). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.51.248, 157.17.18.152, 157.17.160.103, etc.) all targeting destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.61.16.153.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood (the 157.17.x.x addresses).
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate incident response.
