Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags known anomalous source IPs performing ICMP type 8 floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.76.120.97; multiple destination IPs including 163.21.41.208, 163.21.38.0, 163.21.39.16, 203.65.114.251, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Notify affected network segments and prepare mitigation strategies such as ICMP filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacker.
- Update intrusion detection signatures to detect similar ICMP flooding patterns in the future.
