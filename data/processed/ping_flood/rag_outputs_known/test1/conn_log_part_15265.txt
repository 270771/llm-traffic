Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type observed in the log is 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single ICMP timestamp request. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP echo requests exceeding the threshold.
