Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly provided in the Zeek conn.log snippet, but the log shows only a single ICMP connection record with no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP traffic between the given source and destination IPs, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The connection state is OTH (other), which typically indicates a connection that did not complete normally, not necessarily a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP record. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or anomalies, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to identify any emerging suspicious patterns.  
- If ICMP traffic volume increases significantly or anomaly heuristics become available, reassess for ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
