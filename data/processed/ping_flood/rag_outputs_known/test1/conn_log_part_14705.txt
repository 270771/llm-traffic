Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not confirm a specific attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for repeated failed connection attempts that might indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activity.
- Enable anomaly detection rules or heuristics related to ICMP traffic to improve detection capability.
