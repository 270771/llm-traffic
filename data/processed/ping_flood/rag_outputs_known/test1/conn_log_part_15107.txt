Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (~0.005 seconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target. The ICMP type is correctly 8, satisfying the ping flood condition, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number is 20 (commonly associated with ICMP flood detection in standard taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Target IP: 13.86.47.233 (ICMP destination port 8)
- Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (ICMP source port 0, as expected for ICMP)

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 13.86.47.233.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with upstream providers to identify and block malicious sources.
- Consider temporarily blackholing or isolating the target IP if service disruption persists.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and update firewall/IDS signatures accordingly.
