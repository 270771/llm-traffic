Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log are 0, 8, and 0, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present (from 61.1.51.193 to 162.65.41.219).
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic does not show repeated or high-volume ICMP echo requests indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo request frequency or checking other logs for related anomalies.
