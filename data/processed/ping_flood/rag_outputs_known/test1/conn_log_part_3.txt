Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP, 133.16.14.149, targeting multiple destination IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 20**, which typically flags suspicious ICMP flood behavior. The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"ICMP Flood"** under denial-of-service attack categories.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; Destination IPs include 104.92.234.2, 23.232.217.252, 23.91.143.2, 2.214.243.252, 23.213.88.5, 23.253.132.4, 23.253.152.250, 23.222.92.4, 23.232.102.0, 5.78.213.161, 23.64.2.8, 180.183.32.15, 23.230.98.251, among others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8 for these entries, confirming Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
  4. Notify the upstream ISP or hosting provider of the offending IP to assist in mitigation.
  5. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
