Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.23.202.254 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. There are at least 11 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs including 157.17.195.110, 157.17.190.23, 157.17.168.23, 157.17.190.36, 157.17.191.61, 157.17.39.137, 157.17.195.108, 157.17.224.163, 157.17.190.91, 157.17.163.0 targeting destination IP 54.23.202.254 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor the target IP 54.23.202.254 for service degradation or outages.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP ranges that may be participating in the attack.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required for operations.
