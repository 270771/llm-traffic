Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet; the ICMP type column is marked as "-" which indicates no type 8 packets are confirmed.  
- Only 2 ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP packet types and counts to confirm if type 8 packets are present in higher volume.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious behavior.
