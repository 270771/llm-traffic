Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 7, 5, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types correspond to Redirect (type 5), Echo Reply (type 0), and an uncommon type 7, which do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity, especially the IP 203.65.114.222 which appears multiple times.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
