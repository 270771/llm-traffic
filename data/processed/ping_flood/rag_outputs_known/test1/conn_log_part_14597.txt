Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 5th field after IPs is the ICMP type; here it is "11"), which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messages (Time Exceeded), which are common in network diagnostics or routing issues.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Investigate if these ICMP Time Exceeded messages correlate with network routing problems or traceroute activity.
- Collect more detailed heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
