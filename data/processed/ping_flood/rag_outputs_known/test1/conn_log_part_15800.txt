Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request flood detected").
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
