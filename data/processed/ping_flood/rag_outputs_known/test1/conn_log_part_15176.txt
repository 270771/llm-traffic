Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet and some from 157.17.x.x, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP port 8.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
  5. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPs to determine if they are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
