Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 3 instances are observed targeting 43.202.248.60 from different source IPs (133.247.15.62, 133.247.54.18, 157.17.63.51). This count is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP type 0 packet (Echo Reply) from 202.100.171.214 to 178.222.47.148 does not match ping flood criteria.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request volume or repeated patterns from the same source IPs, which could indicate an emerging ping flood or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
