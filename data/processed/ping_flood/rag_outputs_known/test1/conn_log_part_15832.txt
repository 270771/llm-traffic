Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to overwhelming ICMP Echo Requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.93.2) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target IP 52.236.221.123 for service availability and performance degradation.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
