Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 130.197.147.188 to 52.237.221.62, and there is only 1 occurrence.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 13 (Timestamp Request), which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types over time to detect emerging patterns.
