Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 9 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack in the absence of known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are suspicious or part of a known attack pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests distributed across multiple destination IPs, which could be legitimate network scanning or monitoring activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume from source IP 54.249.10.152 to these or other destinations.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs later match heuristic 20 or other suspicious behavior.  
- Investigate the source IP 54.249.10.152 for any unusual activity or reputation issues.
