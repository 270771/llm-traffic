Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 36.40.66.127 to 163.252.46.96, and there is only one instance of it. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 36.40.66.127 or destination IP 163.252.46.96 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.
