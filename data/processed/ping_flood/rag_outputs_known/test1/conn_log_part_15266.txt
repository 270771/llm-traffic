Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (159.109.173.90) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic, which typically corresponds to heuristic number 20 in common taxonomies (ICMP flood detection).
- The involved IP address is the source 159.109.173.90 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 203.78.182.77, 203.78.180.20, 202.194.63.1, 163.252.194.208, 133.251.113.64, etc.). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but are logged as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 159.109.173.90 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to prevent amplification or further attack propagation.
