Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (here >10), which is clearly met.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in 133.247.17.116 through 133.247.243.59 range; destination IP: 52.230.228.52; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host (52.230.228.52) for performance degradation or service disruption.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking sources if the flood volume escalates.
4. Deploy or tune anomaly detection systems to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
5. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for remediation.
