Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the fundamental condition for a ping flood (multiple ICMP type 8 packets) is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood or other specific attack patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to ensure visibility into ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics once anomaly data is available to correlate suspicious IPs.
