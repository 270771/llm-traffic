Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) within a very short time window, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances exceeds the threshold of 10, confirming the volume needed to classify this as a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard network security heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.16.67.79, 133.16.13.186, 133.16.165.245, etc.)
- Destination IP: 52.190.120.127
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.190.120.127.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic before it reaches the network.
- Ensure that critical services on 52.190.120.127 have redundancy or failover to minimize impact.
