Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.18.10) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) directed at a single host, indicating a volumetric ICMP flood attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.81.6, 133.247.244.48, 133.247.61.188, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.127.18.10 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.127.18.10.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Engage incident response to investigate potential compromise or botnet involvement of source IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., DDoS protection appliances or cloud-based scrubbing).
