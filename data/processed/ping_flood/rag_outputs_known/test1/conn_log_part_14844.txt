Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs per heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to identify any echo request floods.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity given the high number of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or other reconnaissance but not ping flooding.
