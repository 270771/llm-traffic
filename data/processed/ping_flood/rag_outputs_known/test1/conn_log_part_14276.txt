Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time window (~1 second). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.50.133, 133.247.182.41, 133.247.50.190, etc.) all targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (157.187.159.183) for performance degradation or service impact.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if it originates externally.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on volume, type, and target concentration.
