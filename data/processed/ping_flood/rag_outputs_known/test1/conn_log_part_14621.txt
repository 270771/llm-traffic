Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack, and no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation. Investigate if these ICMP requests are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance activity.
