Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN scans or failed connections (S0 state), which may indicate scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to confirm ping flood attempts.
