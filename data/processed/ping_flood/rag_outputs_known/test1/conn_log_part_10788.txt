Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources to a single destination) typically classified under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.55.124, 220.241.67.135) all targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 54.179.180.7.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs sending excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the owner of 54.179.180.7 to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate mitigation efforts.
- Consider deploying upstream DDoS protection services if the attack volume escalates.
