Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.134.27) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of source IPs (multiple 133.247.x.x addresses) sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range; destination IP 34.25.134.27; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request); ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns targeting 34.25.134.27.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or abuse.
- Consider temporarily blackholing or isolating the victim IP if service disruption persists.
