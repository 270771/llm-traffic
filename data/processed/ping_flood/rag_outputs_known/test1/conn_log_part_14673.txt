Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, the fundamental condition for detecting a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.
- The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state further, as this may indicate a port scan or other reconnaissance activity.
- Apply heuristic 20 if available, which typically relates to known anomalous IPs or ports, to correlate with any suspicious IPs.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
