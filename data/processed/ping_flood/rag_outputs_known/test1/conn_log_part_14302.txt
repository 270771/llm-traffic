Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 3.231.100.178 to multiple destination IPs, which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 4 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 from the same source IP within the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- One entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 157.17.59.190 to 52.175.248.229, which is normal response traffic, not an attack indicator.

No other attack patterns are evident in the snippet. Without anomaly data or heuristics, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to multiple destinations.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count exceeds the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 3.231.100.178 for unusual ICMP activity patterns over time.
