Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is indicated by the 8th field after the protocol (icmp), which appears to be the "icmp_type" or similar. In the provided entries, the ICMP type values are 11, 11, and 3 respectively, none of which is 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators matching heuristic 20 or similar.  
- The traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern which requires multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) suggest normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior or repeated error messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or spikes in ICMP traffic volume.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate for potential threats.
