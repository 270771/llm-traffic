Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 50.239.214.145, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and one source IP 52.230.228.52 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 50.239.214.145.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blackholing traffic if the attack persists.
  5. Notify the affected system owner and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation support.
