Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.116.11.97) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.45.57, 133.247.45.249, 133.247.126.120, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.116.11.97.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse to prevent further participation in the attack.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack as per standard detection heuristics.
