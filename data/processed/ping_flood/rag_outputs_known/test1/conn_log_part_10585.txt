Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.129.153, 163.252.0.62, 163.252.126.5, 163.252.241.45, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
