Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- The source IP 133.16.14.149 alone generates numerous ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs, consistent with a distributed or volumetric ping flood pattern.
- Other IPs such as 54.203.204.55 and 54.135.122.13 also send multiple ICMP type 8 packets to various targets, reinforcing the pattern of a coordinated ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: ICMP type 8 with at least 10 instances.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, heuristic number 1 (common for volumetric ICMP floods).

Involved IP addresses:
- Attackers (sources): 133.16.14.149, 54.203.204.55, 54.135.122.13, 52.194.220.98, 203.114.130.95
- Targets (destinations): Multiple, including 23.250.107.250, 23.229.216.8, 104.98.180.4, 163.210.78.150, 203.54.119.202, etc.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0 or dash.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to reduce the flood volume.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs (133.16.14.149, 54.203.204.55, 54.135.122.13, 52.194.220.98, 203.114.130.95) using firewall or intrusion prevention systems.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources to assist in mitigation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation appliances or cloud-based DDoS protection services if the attack persists.
