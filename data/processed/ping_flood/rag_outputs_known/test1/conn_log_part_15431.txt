Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (16.160.194.189), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to classify this as a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other sources to the same destination IP. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for a potential ping flood. Also, consider correlating with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify any emerging suspicious behavior.
