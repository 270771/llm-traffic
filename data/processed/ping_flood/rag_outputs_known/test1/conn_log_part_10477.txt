Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type (11) corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.105.97 sending ICMP type 8 packets if the volume increases.
