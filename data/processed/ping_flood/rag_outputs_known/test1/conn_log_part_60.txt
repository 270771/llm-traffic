Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time window (~2 seconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to various targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches the heuristic that requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances to confirm a ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the primary attacker sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs such as 23.76.62.0, 104.95.197.250, 23.73.70.4, 104.81.42.0, 23.77.248.4, 104.124.65.250, 184.166.73.253, 104.68.88.3, 23.214.212.4, 23.243.195.9, 184.206.205.252, 104.119.70.5.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other suspicious activity from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic review of the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader DDoS activity.
