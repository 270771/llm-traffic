Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20).  
- The traffic volume and frequency do not indicate a flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, no further immediate action is warranted.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior suspicious activity in other datasets.
