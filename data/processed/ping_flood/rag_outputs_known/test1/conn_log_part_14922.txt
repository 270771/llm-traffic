Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP type is 3 (destination unreachable), which does not correspond to a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.
- The traffic pattern does not match typical ping flood behavior, which involves multiple ICMP echo requests from a source to a destination in rapid succession.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination IP 203.78.173.196 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
