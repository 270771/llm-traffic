Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 3, 10, and 8, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present.
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or checking other logs for related anomalies.
