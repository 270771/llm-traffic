Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 1 is an Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, which are normal ICMP message types and do not alone indicate flooding or attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns over time.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged by heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume or source/destination IP reputation.
