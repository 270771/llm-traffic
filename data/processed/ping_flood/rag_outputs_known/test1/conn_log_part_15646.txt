Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~milliseconds). There are at least 8 distinct connections with ICMP type 8 packets from this source, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the rapid succession and multiple distinct targets strongly suggest a ping flood, especially since no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (e.g., heuristic 20) are present to exempt the threshold.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 1 (common ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121 sending ICMP echo requests (type 8) to destination IPs 163.252.104.16, 163.252.133.254, 163.252.10.242, 163.252.44.244, 163.252.140.92, 163.252.44.245, 163.252.103.141, and 163.252.44.189. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
  4. Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
  5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IP is external and not part of legitimate traffic.
