Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with flooding behavior.
- Multiple source IPs (54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, suggesting a distributed or multi-target ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this pattern aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179).
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential DoS impact.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known malicious or from suspicious regions.

This evidence conclusively indicates an ongoing ICMP ping flood attack.
