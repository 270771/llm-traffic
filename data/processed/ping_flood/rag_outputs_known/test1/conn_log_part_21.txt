Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.174.6 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request flood detected").
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.174.6 is the attacker; destination IPs range across 202.252.225.144 through 202.252.225.191 and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 129.43.174.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 129.43.174.6 to identify compromise or misuse.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack if it persists.
