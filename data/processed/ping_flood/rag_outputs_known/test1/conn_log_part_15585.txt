Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.173.253, 133.228.56.42, 133.228.76.158, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor the target host (16.160.152.89) for service degradation or outages and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing if necessary.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet, and update firewall rules accordingly.
