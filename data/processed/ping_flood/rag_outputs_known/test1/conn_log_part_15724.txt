Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The connection state is OTH (other), and no suspicious port or IP behavior is evident.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
