Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets count toward ping flood detection.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 203.78.177.156 to 208.31.9.44). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume and mixed ICMP types suggest normal or incidental ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.177.156 or destination 208.31.9.44 appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more data to confirm if a pattern emerges that meets ping flood criteria.
