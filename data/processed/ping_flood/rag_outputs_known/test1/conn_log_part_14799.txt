Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, but the total count of such instances is fewer than 10 (only about 10 lines total, some with type 8, some with other types).  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV.  
- The traffic does not show a clear pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source flooding a target, but rather multiple distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination (52.238.213.5), which could be normal network scanning or benign activity.  
- No heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific label, but the absence of anomaly data and the low count of ICMP type 8 packets indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the multiple distinct sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to 52.238.213.5 are expected behavior (e.g., monitoring or legitimate network scans).  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume or repeated patterns from single IPs that might indicate evolving attack behavior.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection rules for heuristic 20 (if available) to catch future suspicious ICMP floods.
