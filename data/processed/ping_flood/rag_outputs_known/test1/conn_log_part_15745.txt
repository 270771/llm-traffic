Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries in the log have type values 3 or 13, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 and 13 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Timestamp, which are not typical of flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual behavior or other logs indicating anomalies.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify ICMP anomalies in the future.
