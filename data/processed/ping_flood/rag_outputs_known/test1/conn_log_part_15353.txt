Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from a single source IP, 13.75.4.206, targeting multiple destination IPs (133.251.201.198, 133.251.203.101, 133.251.208.57, 133.251.203.164, 133.251.200.3, 133.251.200.33, 133.251.200.62) within a very short time frame. There are at least 8 distinct echo requests logged here, and given the snippet timing, it is likely more are present in the full log.

- All ICMP packets from 13.75.4.206 are type 8, matching the requirement for ping flood detection.

- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard heuristics for ICMP flood attacks, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IP addresses are:
  - Source: 13.75.4.206
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 133.251.x.x range.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.75.4.206 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Investigate the source host 13.75.4.206 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify network operations and security teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
