Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.228.4.24) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP, indicating a distributed flood rather than a single host, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (here >10), which is clearly met.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the volume and nature of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP 54.228.4.24; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy network-level filtering to drop excessive ICMP traffic targeting 54.228.4.24.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Investigate upstream providers or contact source networks to mitigate the distributed nature of the attack.
- Consider enabling ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
- Log and alert on continued ICMP flood attempts for further forensic analysis.
