Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.237.185.15, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the general heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one destination indicate a ping flood (heuristic 20 by common convention).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.232.124, 157.17.206.24, 157.17.45.255, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 54.237.185.15 for performance degradation and consider isolating it if service impact is detected.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
