Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.107.202 to destination 35.173.100.241, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 133.228.208.62 to 115.184.127.115) has ICMP type 11, which is not type 8 and therefore not part of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.

Since no heuristics or taxonomy data are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
