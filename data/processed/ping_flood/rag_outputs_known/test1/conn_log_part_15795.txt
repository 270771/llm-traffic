Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.19.4, 163.252.105.252, 163.252.96.57, and multiple others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events.
5. Consider deploying ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies to mitigate such volumetric attacks proactively.
