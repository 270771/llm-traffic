Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.239.183.175) from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.253.222, 133.240.217.64, 133.240.217.255, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 54.239.183.175.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or multi-vector attacks.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
- Consider temporarily blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from an untrusted or unexpected region.
