Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the general heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source indicate a ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.79.221, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.79.254, 163.252.233.40, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or other sources.
- Investigate the source host 16.172.102.121 for compromise or misconfiguration causing the flood.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact.
