Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (50.239.214.145) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.166.49, 157.17.224.198, 157.17.196.149, etc.) all targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (50.239.214.145) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
  4. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
  5. Log and alert on continued ICMP flood attempts for further forensic analysis.
