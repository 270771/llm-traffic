Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is only one instance of type 8 (from 13.74.134.236 to 133.251.222.171) and one instance of type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 11 packet could be part of normal network diagnostics or unrelated issues.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any heuristic 20 or other anomaly heuristics become relevant with additional data.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns over time.
