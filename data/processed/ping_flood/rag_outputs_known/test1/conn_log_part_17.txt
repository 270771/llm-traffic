Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (129.43.79.249) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.79.249; Destination IPs range from 133.141.197.148 through 133.141.197.171.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 129.43.79.249 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
