Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but do not reach the threshold of at least 10 instances from a single source IP to multiple destinations within this snippet, except for IP 133.16.14.149 which sends multiple ICMP type 8 packets. However, these are spread across different destination IPs with no clear indication of flooding a single target. Also, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, and no explicit flooding pattern (high volume of ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single IP) is observed, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply an attack.

Next steps: Monitor the source IP 133.16.14.149 for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single destination IP, which could indicate the start of a ping flood. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related logs.
