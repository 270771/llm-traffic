Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly data or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 3 typically signals network issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of anomaly data.

Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.
