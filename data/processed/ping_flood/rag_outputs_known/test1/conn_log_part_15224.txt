Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the provided conn.log entries is 0, not 8, which means these are not echo request packets used in ping floods. Additionally, there are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of 10 instances required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate further by collecting more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs to check for echo request floods (ICMP type 8) and monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated source IPs. Also, enable anomaly detection tools to capture heuristic matches for more accurate classification.
