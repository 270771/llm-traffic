Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 13.208.10.201 to 203.78.176.185). The other entry is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No attack is present. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo request and reply exchanges, not a flood. Without anomaly or heuristic data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP echo requests exceeding normal thresholds.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
