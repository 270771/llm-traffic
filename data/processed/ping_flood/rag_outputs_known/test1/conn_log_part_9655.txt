Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.61.26.217) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from standard ping flood detection rules) which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one host.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack" due to the volume and nature of ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 44.61.26.217; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.61.26.217.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP range if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare to activate incident response procedures.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates to protect network resources.
