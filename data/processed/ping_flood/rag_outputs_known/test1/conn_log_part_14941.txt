Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP type, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded message. This could be normal network behavior related to traceroute or TTL expiry.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 Echo Requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If multiple such packets appear (â‰¥10), investigate for potential ping flood. Also, collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
