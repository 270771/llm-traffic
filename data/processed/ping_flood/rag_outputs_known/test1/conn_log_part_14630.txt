Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple unique source IPs (e.g., 157.17.142.126, 157.17.21.102, 157.17.66.121, etc.) are sending these requests, indicating a distributed or coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this fits heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP 161.67.57.135; ICMP protocol, no ports (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
