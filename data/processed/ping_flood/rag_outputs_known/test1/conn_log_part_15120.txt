Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-volume or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 10 (Timestamp Request) and 13 (Timestamp Reply) traffic if unusual for the environment.
