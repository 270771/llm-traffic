Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values present are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request), but only one instance of ICMP type 8 is observed (line with src IP 54.205.67.225).
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved; no such anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided.
- The other ICMP types (11) do not correspond to ping flood traffic.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests from the IP 54.205.67.225 could be prudent to detect any escalation.
