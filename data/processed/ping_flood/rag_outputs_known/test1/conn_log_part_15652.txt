Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 35.169.51.96, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 35.169.51.96.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for broader attack patterns.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
