Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. A ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
