Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (such as heuristic 20).  
- The traffic does not show the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, no further immediate action is warranted.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
