Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8, but the only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence (one packet from 54.186.116.19 to 163.252.4.221).  
- The other ICMP entry with type 0 (Echo Reply) is from 133.247.144.248 to 54.229.78.71, which is not an Echo Request and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override this threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo request/reply exchanges.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs show repeated ICMP echo requests exceeding threshold in a larger dataset.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
