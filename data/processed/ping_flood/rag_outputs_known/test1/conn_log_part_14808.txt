Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 3, 10, 8, and 11. Only the entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.17), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = destination unreachable, 10 = router solicitation, 11 = time exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may be normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to apply heuristics and taxonomy for better classification.
