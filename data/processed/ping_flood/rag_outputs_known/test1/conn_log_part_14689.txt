Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (13.211.197.216) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 8 distinct entries with ICMP type 8, and given the snippet timing and volume, this strongly indicates a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10 in this snippet, the consistent ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations, combined with the absence of any known anomalous IPs or heuristic data, supports the conclusion of a ping flood.
- Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20** (commonly associated with ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.211.197.216; Destination IPs include 203.78.188.65, 203.78.176.185, 203.78.188.94, 203.78.188.101, 203.78.176.196, 203.78.148.105, and 203.78.148.101. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.211.197.216 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
  4. Implement ICMP rate limiting and consider deploying anomaly-based detection rules to catch similar future attacks early.
