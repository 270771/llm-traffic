Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but fewer than 10 instances are observed in the snippet (only 5 distinct entries with type 8). Additionally, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the provided CSV. Other ICMP types (such as 3, 0, 11) are also present, which are unrelated to ping floods.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be assigned. No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated requests from the same source IPs. Investigate if any of the IPs involved have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.
