Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs mostly in the 157.17.x.x range and one in 133.247.49.34, all targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or amplification attempts.
  3. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or blackholing to mitigate volumetric impact on the target host.
