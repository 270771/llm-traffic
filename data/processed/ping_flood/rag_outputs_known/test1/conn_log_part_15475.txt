Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3, 11, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and in fact, none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes and investigate if such patterns emerge.
