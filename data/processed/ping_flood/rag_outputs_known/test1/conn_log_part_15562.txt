Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are not related to ping floods but could be indicative of network issues or other types of ICMP activity.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no other attack types can be confidently identified here. The observed ICMP traffic should be monitored for potential network troubleshooting but does not currently indicate an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Investigate the source IPs if repeated ICMP errors persist, as they may indicate misconfigurations or other network problems.
