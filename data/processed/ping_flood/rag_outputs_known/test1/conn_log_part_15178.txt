Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs to one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.169.160, 133.247.47.41, 133.247.253.217, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 54.229.78.71.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify the affected system owner and coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Monitor for any escalation or changes in attack vectors following mitigation steps.
