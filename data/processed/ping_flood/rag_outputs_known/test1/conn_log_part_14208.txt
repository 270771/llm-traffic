Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 18.36.162.241, from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic signature of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a victim with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.  
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an "ICMP Ping Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Destination IP: 18.36.162.241 (target of the ping flood)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.247.253.77, 133.247.82.249, 133.247.214.243, 61.216.156.137, and many others from the 133.247.x.x subnet.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.36.162.241.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IP addresses for potential spoofing or botnet involvement; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential escalation to upstream providers or law enforcement if attack persists.
