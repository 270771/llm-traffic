Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to one or multiple destinations.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source: 13.242.241.56 (attacker)
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 163.252.x.x range
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP 13.242.241.56 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
