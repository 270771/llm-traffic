Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two: from 133.247.170.126 to 54.229.78.71 and from 203.78.187.167 to 69.87.118.89.
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not relevant to ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 conditions, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP traffic, as they may be benign or part of other reconnaissance activities.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
