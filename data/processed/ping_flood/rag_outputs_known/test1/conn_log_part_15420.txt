Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries in the snippet have ICMP types 3, 128, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match a ping flood or related ICMP-based DoS attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and their frequency.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
