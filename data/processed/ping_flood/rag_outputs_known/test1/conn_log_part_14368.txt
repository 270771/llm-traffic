Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from many sources targeting a single victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.30.122, 133.247.24.1, 133.247.50.170, etc.) flooding destination 157.187.159.183. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 157.187.159.183.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood (133.247.30.122, 133.247.24.1, etc.) at firewall or router level.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods.
  4. Engage incident response to assess potential impact on the victim host and ensure availability.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP floods in the future.
