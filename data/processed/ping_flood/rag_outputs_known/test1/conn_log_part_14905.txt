Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly `3` (Destination Unreachable) and `8` only appears once (line with src IP 139.179.133.57 and dst IP 203.78.173.107).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is the required minimum to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (none are found here).  
- The majority of ICMP traffic is type 3, which typically indicates error messages, not echo requests used in ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 traffic could be normal network error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 203.78.173.107 for any unusual behavior.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
