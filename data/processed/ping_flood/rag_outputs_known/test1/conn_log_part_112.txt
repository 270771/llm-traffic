Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 3.30.218.60 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are flooding destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) targeting 3.30.218.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and whitelist trusted management hosts if needed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle the attack traffic closer to the source.
- Implement or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
