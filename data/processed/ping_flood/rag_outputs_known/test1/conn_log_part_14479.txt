Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance recorded, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood, but monitoring ICMP traffic for unusual volumes or types is recommended. If ICMP type 11 messages spike, investigate potential network routing or TTL issues.
