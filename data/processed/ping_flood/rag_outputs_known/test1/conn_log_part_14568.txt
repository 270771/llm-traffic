Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet. Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.  
- Only one ICMP connection record is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise or to indicate related suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the single ICMP OTH (other) connection record. The OTH state means the connection did not complete normally, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps:  
- Collect more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs to verify if multiple ICMP type 8 packets are present.  
- Enable detailed ICMP type logging in Zeek to explicitly capture ICMP types for better analysis.  
- Investigate any repeated ICMP traffic from or to the involved IPs if more data becomes available.
