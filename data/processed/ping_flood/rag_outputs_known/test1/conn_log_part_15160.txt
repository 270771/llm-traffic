Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the volume of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs (192.61.120.67 and 133.228.165.53) for any other suspicious activity or known threat intelligence matches.
