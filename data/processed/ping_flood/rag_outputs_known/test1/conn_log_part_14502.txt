Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Since no ICMP traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present. The observed traffic may warrant investigation for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high number of SYN packets with no completion (S0) for possible scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for ICMP Echo Requests if ping flood is suspected in the future.
