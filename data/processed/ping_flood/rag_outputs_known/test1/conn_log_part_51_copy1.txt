Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded), with only one entry showing ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is not met here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic observed is consistent with various ICMP error messages rather than a flood of echo requests.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages suggests normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual behavior since it appears frequently but is not currently flooding with ping requests.
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
