Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.101.198, 163.252.215.105, 163.252.176.188, 163.252.171.193, 163.252.31.88, 163.252.255.109, 163.252.213.165, 163.252.64.5, 163.252.216.194, 163.252.254.9, 163.252.187.198, 163.252.255.180, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.216.148, 163.252.184.1, 163.252.215.185, 163.252.220.6.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed and take appropriate remediation steps.
