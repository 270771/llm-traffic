Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.178.233.150, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack (multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame).
- No anomalies or heuristic matches are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this fits heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 130.197.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.178.233.150. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the target host 54.178.233.150 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with DoS protection.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers for source filtering.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
