Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (35.119.5.36) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria specify at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to confirm a ping flood, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IP: 35.119.5.36 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple 163.252.x.x addresses (targets)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 35.119.5.36 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or further suspicious ICMP traffic.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DoS protection features on network devices.
