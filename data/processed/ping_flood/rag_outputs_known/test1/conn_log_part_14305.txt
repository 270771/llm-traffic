Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.49.34 to destination 23.206.42.201, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Echo Reply), which does not qualify as a ping flood indicator.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which are not present here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 133.247.49.34 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential reconnaissance or low-rate ICMP scanning.
