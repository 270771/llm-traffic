Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet or compromised hosts within the source subnet.
  3. Engage incident response to investigate the source hosts for compromise and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs if the attack volume escalates beyond local mitigation capabilities.
