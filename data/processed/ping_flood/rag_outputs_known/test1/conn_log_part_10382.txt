Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.22.151.10 within a very short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.83.198, 133.247.144.251, 133.247.15.62, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.22.151.10 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter or on the affected host to mitigate the flood.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP addresses at the firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and intent of the traffic.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services if not already in place.
