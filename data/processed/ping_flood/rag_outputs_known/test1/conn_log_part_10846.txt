Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with a single instance each, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP errors or unusual traffic patterns.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
