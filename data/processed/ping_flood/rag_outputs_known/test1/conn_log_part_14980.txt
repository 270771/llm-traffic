Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are mostly not 8 (Echo Request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (139.179.133.57 â†’ 203.78.173.232), but there is only a single instance of type 8.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here (no anomaly data or heuristic context provided).  
- The other ICMP types (0, 3, 11) correspond to Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal ICMP traffic types and do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to apply heuristics when available.
