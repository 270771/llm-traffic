Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 13 traffic is normal for network time synchronization and does not match common attack patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show increased ICMP echo requests or anomalies related to these IPs.
