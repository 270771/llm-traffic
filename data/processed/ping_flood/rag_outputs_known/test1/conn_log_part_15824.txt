Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one destination in rapid succession.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 133.247.49.34, all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.236.221.123.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16 and 133.247.49.34) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP ranges.
  5. If possible, apply upstream filtering with the ISP to block excessive ICMP traffic before it reaches the network.
