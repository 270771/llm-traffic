Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 35.127.34.186 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets in a short interval targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.37.158, 133.247.180.158, 133.247.37.220, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.127.34.186. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 35.127.34.186 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source IPs and assess if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
