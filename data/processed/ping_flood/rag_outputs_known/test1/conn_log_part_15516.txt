Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries are two distinct connections: from 203.78.177.156 to 186.241.12.62, and from 51.121.111.183 to 133.251.104.182.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 instances is less than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- Other ICMP types (3 and others) are present but are unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) may warrant investigation into network issues or scanning activity but does not constitute a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any suspicious behavior if they persist or increase in volume.
