Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP type field is 11, as indicated by the "11" in the fourth column), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP type, far below the threshold of 10 required for detection unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, which are typically normal network diagnostic traffic.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets or any emerging anomalies is recommended.
