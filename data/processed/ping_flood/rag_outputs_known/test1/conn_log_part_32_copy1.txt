Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.239.183.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.235.151, 133.240.40.122, 133.240.235.176, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.239.183.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 54.239.183.175 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts to prevent recurrence.
