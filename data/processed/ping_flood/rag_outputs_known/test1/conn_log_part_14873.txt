Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are only 4 entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP (18.101.165.68), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP activity or isolated pings.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source(s) to the same destination(s).  
- Investigate the sources 133.247.50.131, 133.247.44.22, 133.247.246.96, and 133.247.135.209 for unusual behavior if the volume grows.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.
