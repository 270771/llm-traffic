Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no explicit ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) present. Only one ICMP instance is logged, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. The ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not a flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data for deeper analysis.
