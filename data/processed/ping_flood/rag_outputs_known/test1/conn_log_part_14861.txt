Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.40.222, 163.252.20.32, 163.252.50.2, and many others. Ports are 0 as expected for ICMP.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., IDS/IPS signatures, rate limiting) to prevent recurrence.
