Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records are found, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range flooding the destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 3.116.11.97 and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the offending sources if the attack persists.
