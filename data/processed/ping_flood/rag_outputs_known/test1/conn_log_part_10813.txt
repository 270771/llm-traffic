Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from IP 54.200.201.221 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range, as well as multiple other source IPs targeting 35.183.65.24.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.200.201.221 (primary attacker), other sources include 133.247.x.x range; Destination IPs include 203.78.x.x and 35.183.65.24; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), port fields irrelevant for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.200.201.221 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor and block other suspicious source IPs sending excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders to protect critical infrastructure.
- Review and update ICMP handling policies to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic.
