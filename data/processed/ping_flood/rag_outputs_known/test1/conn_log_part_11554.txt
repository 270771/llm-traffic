Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178). This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests within a very short timestamp window strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs targeting the same destination IP(s). This matches heuristic 20 (as referenced in the instructions).
- The taxonomy class is likely "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP Echo Requests.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations to monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a forensic review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if the attack volume increases.
