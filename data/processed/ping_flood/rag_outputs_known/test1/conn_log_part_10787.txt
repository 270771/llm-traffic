Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7, originating from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP from multiple sources, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.239.146, 157.17.138.38, 157.17.51.248, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for performance degradation or service impact.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
5. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet and remediate accordingly.
