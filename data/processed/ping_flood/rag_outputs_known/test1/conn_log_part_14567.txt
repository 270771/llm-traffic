Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No further investigation for ping flood is warranted. However, the presence of ICMP type 11 could indicate network issues or traceroute activity, which may be investigated if unusual patterns emerge.
