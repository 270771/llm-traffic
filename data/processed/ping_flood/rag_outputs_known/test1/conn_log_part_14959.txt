Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two: from 51.121.111.183 to 163.252.247.113 and from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.253. This is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The majority of ICMP traffic shown is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods but may indicate other network issues or scanning activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages could warrant further investigation into network reachability or scanning behavior, but it does not meet criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect scanning or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 messages for potential misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity.
