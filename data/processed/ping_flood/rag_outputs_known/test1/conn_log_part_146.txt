Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of either 3 or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal ICMP error messages, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP error message patterns or other suspicious activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other anomalies.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
