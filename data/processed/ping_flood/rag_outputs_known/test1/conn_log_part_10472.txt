Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is represented by the 5th column after the source IP (e.g., the values 3, 10, 0, 0 in the relevant positions), none of which correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- Additionally, there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types present (3, 10, 0) correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., Destination Unreachable, Router Advertisement, Echo Reply), which do not match ping flood behavior.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, the presence of ICMP traffic with types other than 8 should be monitored for potential network issues or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 10 messages to ensure they are legitimate network control messages and not part of a different attack vector.  
- Enable logging and alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts promptly.
