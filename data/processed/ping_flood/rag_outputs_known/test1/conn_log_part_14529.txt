Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.48 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood detection.
- The pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet flooding destination IP 69.47.68.48 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no ports involved (ICMP protocol).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 69.47.68.48.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.247.0.0/16 if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
- Engage incident response to assess potential impact on the target host and prepare mitigation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
