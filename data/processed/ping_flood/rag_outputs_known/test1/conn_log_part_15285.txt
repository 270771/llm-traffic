Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 0, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
