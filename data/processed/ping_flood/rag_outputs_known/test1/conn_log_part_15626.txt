Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.221.141.21 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate broader mitigation.
