Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed source pattern typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records are found, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 161.67.57.135.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or secondary attacks.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and affected system owners to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
