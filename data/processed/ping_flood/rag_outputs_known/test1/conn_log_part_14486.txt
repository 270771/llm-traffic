Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable detailed ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 if it becomes available, which may relate to known anomalous IPs.

No ping flood or related ICMP anomaly is detected in the current data.
