Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, only one instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood attack. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP entry. Without multiple repeated echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 73.221.72.13 to the destination 203.78.187.167. If the count rises above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
