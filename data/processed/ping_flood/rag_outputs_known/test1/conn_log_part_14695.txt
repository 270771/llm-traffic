Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from source IP 133.247.49.34 to destination 23.214.98.253, and there is only 1 such instance in the snippet, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 133.228.62.233 to 180.138.31.121) is type 11, which is not type 8 and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if multiple ICMP echo requests occur in rapid succession.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.49.34 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests, as it could be a precursor to a ping flood.
