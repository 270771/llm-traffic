Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame targeting one host.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.184.11, 133.247.50.144, 133.247.30.24, etc.) flooding destination 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 157.187.159.183.
- Monitor the target host for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible to mitigate impact.
