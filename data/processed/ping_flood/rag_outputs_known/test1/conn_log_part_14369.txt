Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 157.187.159.183, all within a very short time window (timestamps around 1641099664.5). This matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) does not apply. The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is clearly met.
- The most likely heuristic is heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.35.253, 133.247.50.151, 133.247.143.190, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and assess if these IPs are compromised hosts.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
  5. Notify network operations to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
