Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as port scans or floods on other protocols.

No heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned due to lack of anomaly data and context.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect possible denial-of-service symptoms.
