Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20, typically related to volumetric ICMP echo request anomalies).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact on targeted hosts.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts.
5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches internal networks.
