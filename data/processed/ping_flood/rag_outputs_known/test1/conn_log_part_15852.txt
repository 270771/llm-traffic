Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the snippet shows mostly values other than 8 (e.g., 0, 3), and only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 157.17.109.93 and 157.17.226.96).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) indicates normal ICMP traffic or other network diagnostics, not flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs 157.17.109.93 and 157.17.226.96 for unusual behavior if ICMP traffic volume rises.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
