Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 50.239.214.145, which matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP echo requests flooding one target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 50.239.214.145 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
  5. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
