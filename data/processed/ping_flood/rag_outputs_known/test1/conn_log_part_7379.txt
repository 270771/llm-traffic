Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets sent in rapid succession from multiple source IPs (notably 52.230.228.52 and many 133.228.x.x addresses) targeting a single destination IP 50.239.214.145 and others in the 203.78.x.x range.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of many ICMP echo requests with short intervals and no corresponding replies is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Sources include 52.230.228.52 and multiple 133.228.x.x addresses; primary destination is 50.239.214.145.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules on intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- Monitor the affected destination IP 50.239.214.145 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims and sources to contain the attack.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is high to coordinate filtering.
- Consider deploying blackhole routing or scrubbing services if attack persists.
