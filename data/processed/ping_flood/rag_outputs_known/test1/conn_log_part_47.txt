Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (18.98.73.236) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the required type for ping floods.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 130.90.x.x subnet targeting destination IP 18.98.73.236. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor the destination host (18.98.73.236) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if the attack volume escalates.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any source IPs are spoofed and update firewall rules accordingly.
