Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.36.162.241) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs targeting one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.38.10, 133.247.38.76, 133.247.97.126, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 18.36.162.241. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (18.36.162.241) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) with signatures/rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic review to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting 18.36.162.241, consistent with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
