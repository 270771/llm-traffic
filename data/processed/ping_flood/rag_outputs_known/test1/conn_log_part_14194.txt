Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.173.100.241) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any are internal assets requiring additional protection.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if 35.173.100.241 is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events early.
- Consider engaging upstream ISP to filter or mitigate traffic from the offending source IP.
