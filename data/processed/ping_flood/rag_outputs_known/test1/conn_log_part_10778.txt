Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.47.69.34) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here. The taxonomy class is consistent with a volumetric ICMP flood attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.140.32, 133.247.61.168, 133.247.76.187, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 69.47.69.34. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (69.47.69.34) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse within the network.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.
