Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 3, 1, 8, and 13. Only one entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is insufficient to meet the threshold of at least 10 instances for a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 1 = Echo Reply, 13 = Timestamp) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic pattern does not match typical ping flood behavior, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8) from one or more sources targeting a victim.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 13 messages may warrant routine network health checks but do not constitute an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.208.30 and destination IPs for unusual behavior if ICMP traffic volume spikes.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
