Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs, totaling well over 10 instances within a short time frame.
- ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume and rapid succession of these requests from a single source IP to multiple destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 104.93.186.6, 104.115.153.248, 200.140.56.149, 23.86.123.252, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood. Conduct further investigation on the source host for compromise or misconfiguration. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems.
