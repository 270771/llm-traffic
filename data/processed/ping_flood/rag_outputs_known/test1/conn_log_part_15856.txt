Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," which are normal control messages, not flooding behavior.  

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and checking for repeated high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from any source IPs to detect potential ping floods.
