Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet. The ICMP type must be 8 to qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Collect more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs with explicit ICMP type details.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
