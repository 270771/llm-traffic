Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No other attack type is indicated by this data. Since ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, this traffic appears benign.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or if other anomalies emerge.
