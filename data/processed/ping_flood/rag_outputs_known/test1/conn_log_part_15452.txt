Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or internal network teams to trace and mitigate the source of the flood.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Document and alert security operations for ongoing monitoring and incident response.
