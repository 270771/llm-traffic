Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. There are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristics indicating suspicious IPs or behavior.

No attack is present. The ICMP type 3 indicates a standard network error message, not an attack. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further classification applies.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or multiple ICMP errors from the same IPs could be a next step if suspicious activity arises.
