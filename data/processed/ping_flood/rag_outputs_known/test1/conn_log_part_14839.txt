Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 11, 128, and 8. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.69), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 128 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 128 is normal in network operations.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or match heuristic 20 if such context becomes available.
