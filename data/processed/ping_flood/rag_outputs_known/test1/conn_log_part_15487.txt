Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ICMP-based anomalies.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic or at least 10 such instances, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN scans or failed connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for repeated failed connection attempts that may indicate scanning or other reconnaissance heuristics.
