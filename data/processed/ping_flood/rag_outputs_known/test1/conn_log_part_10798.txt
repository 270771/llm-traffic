Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 131.176.198.190 to 129.235.234.57 and from 133.247.49.34 to 104.8.122.4).
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- Other ICMP types present (0, 1, 3, 13) do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) is normal network behavior and not inherently suspicious.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or match known heuristics once available.
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
