Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log typically logs TCP/UDP connections.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log in Zeek) to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known anomaly indicators once anomaly data and heuristic context are available.
