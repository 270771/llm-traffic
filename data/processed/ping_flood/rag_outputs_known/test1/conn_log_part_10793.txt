Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous src/dst IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.1.80, 157.17.212.98, 157.17.172.177, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.179.180.7. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.179.180.7.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact and consider upstream provider coordination to mitigate attack traffic.
  5. Review firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and prevent similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
