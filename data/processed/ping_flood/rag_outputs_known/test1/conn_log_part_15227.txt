Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Without heuristic context or anomaly matches, no further investigation is warranted specifically for ping floods. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs could be a prudent next step.
