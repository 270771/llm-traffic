Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log primarily logs TCP/UDP connections.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for other suspicious TCP anomalies, as many TCP connection attempts show S0 flags (connection attempts without response), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity. This aligns with heuristic 44 (TCP SYN scan) if such heuristics were available.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected in the current data. Further ICMP-focused monitoring is recommended.
