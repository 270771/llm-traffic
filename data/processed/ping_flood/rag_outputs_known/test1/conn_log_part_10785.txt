Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.179.180.7) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources (e.g., 157.17.194.45, 157.17.169.204, 157.17.200.202, etc.) all targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.179.180.7.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse, as they appear to be part of a coordinated flood.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP range if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to monitor for collateral impact and prepare for potential escalation.
