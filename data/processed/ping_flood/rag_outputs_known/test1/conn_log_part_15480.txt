Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if ICMP type 11 packets are part of a traceroute or legitimate network diagnostics.
