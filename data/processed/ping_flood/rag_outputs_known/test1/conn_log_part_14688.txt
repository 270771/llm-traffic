Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 202.47.37.15 to destination 203.78.163.70, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or require separate investigation but do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.47.37.15 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics if available.
