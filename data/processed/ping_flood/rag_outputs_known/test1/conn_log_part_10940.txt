Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.173.100.241) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 11 such instances, exceeding the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.66.234, 157.17.158.183, 157.17.161.227, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the echo request.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (35.173.100.241) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are similarly targeted or involved.
- Consider blackholing or temporarily blocking traffic from the most aggressive source IPs until the attack subsides.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
