Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 8, 3, and others, but there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) in the snippet. Specifically, only two entries have ICMP type 8.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (and no anomaly data is found).  
- The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 0 (echo reply) does not indicate a ping flood.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 IPs, the traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (e.g., 203.78.177.156, 139.179.133.57) show repeated ICMP echo requests over a longer time window.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out low-rate ICMP-based reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse.
