Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, fewer than the minimum 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic or higher volume from these IPs.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.  
- Correlate with other anomaly sources once available to confirm if any heuristic 20 or similar applies.
