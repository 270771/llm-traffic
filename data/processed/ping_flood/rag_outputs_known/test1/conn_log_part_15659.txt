Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are not indicative of ping floods but rather network error or diagnostic messages.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another attack type. Further investigation could focus on the source IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations but no immediate threat is detected.
