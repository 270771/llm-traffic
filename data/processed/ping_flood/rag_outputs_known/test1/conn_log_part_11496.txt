Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating predominantly from source IP 18.112.90.42 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Source IP 18.112.90.42 is the apparent attacker; destination IPs include 203.78.148.101, 203.78.186.200, 203.78.148.102, 203.78.184.230, 203.78.189.189, 203.78.183.227, 203.78.178.99, 203.78.178.92, 203.78.171.216, 203.78.184.232, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.174.99, 203.78.183.157, 203.78.180.45, 203.78.180.59, 203.78.174.114, 203.78.184.64.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.112.90.42 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS and enable alerting on excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- If possible, apply geo-blocking or access control lists to restrict ICMP traffic from suspicious external IP ranges.
