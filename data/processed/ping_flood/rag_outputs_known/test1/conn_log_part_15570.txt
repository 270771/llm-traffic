Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 9 and 1, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP instances total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could focus on the nature of ICMP type 9 (Router Advertisement) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) messages to ensure they are legitimate network traffic and not part of another reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.
