Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.78, and there is only 1 instance of this type.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not available here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 packets may warrant investigation for possible network issues or traceroute activity but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.  
- Investigate the source IPs for unusual behavior if further suspicious activity arises.
