Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the echo request type required for ping floods.
- The volume and concentration of these echo requests from multiple sources to one target strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks, as ping floods are a common DoS vector.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 13.86.47.233 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 13.86.47.233.
- Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
