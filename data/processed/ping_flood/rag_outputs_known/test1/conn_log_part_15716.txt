Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.187.193, 133.228.164.219, 133.228.147.255, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16) targeting 52.236.221.123.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Monitor the target host for signs of resource exhaustion or service degradation.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of similar ICMP floods.
- Notify upstream providers or the source network administrators to remediate the malicious hosts.
