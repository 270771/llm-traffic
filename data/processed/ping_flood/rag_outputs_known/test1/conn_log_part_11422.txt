Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 18.22.226.126 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and all these entries have type 8, confirming the nature of the traffic.
- The source IP 18.22.226.126 is sending multiple ICMP echo requests to various destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection (likely heuristic 1 or 2 in typical taxonomies: ICMP flood or DoS attack).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IPs are:
  - Source: 18.22.226.126
  - Destinations: 163.252.200.198, 163.252.136.162, 163.252.143.181, 163.252.204.186, 163.252.252.235, 163.252.44.38, 163.252.192.71, 163.252.59.96, 163.252.78.244, 163.252.143.180, 163.252.238.74, 163.252.115.78

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 18.22.226.126 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and network performance.
- Conduct a deeper investigation on 18.22.226.126 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS for early warning.
- Consider deploying network-level rate limiting or blackholing for persistent offenders.
