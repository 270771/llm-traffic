Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times from the source IP 54.253.199.134 to different destination IPs (133.102.72.47, 133.102.68.8, 133.102.67.249). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8 or are single occurrences, which do not match the ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears normal or low volume.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in related logs.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
