Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.30.218.60 from multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (here >10) aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.253.210, 133.240.1.240, 133.240.192.221, etc.) flooding destination IP 3.30.218.60. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.30.218.60.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack volume is large to implement upstream filtering or blackholing.
  5. Review and harden the target hostâ€™s ICMP handling policies to reduce impact.
