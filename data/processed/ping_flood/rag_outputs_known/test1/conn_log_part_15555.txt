Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance of it, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 could be related to traceroute or TTL expiry but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in related logs.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these logs for more precise detection.
