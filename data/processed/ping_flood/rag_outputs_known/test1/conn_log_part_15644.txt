Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (here >10).
- The involved IP address is the source 16.172.102.121 sending ICMP echo requests to various destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious hosts.
  3. Investigate the source host 16.172.102.121 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact on the targeted IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
