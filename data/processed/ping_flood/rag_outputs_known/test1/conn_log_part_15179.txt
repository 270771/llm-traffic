Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and a single destination IP 54.229.78.71. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Security response plan: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation and consider blackholing traffic if the attack persists. Additionally, alert network operations and conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
