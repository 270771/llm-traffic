Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets in higher volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP errors or unusual traffic patterns.  
- Obtain heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
