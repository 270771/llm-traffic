Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 69.47.68.29, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and one destination IP 69.47.68.29. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 69.47.68.29. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
