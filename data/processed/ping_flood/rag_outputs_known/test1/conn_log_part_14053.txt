Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows 10 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from different source IPs to a single destination IP strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a target with ICMP Echo Requests) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (133.228.217.204, 133.228.160.134, 133.228.131.197, 133.228.187.193, 133.228.56.41, 133.228.79.235, 133.228.199.252, 133.228.199.254, 133.228.249.62, 133.228.169.82) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 68.104.133.69.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a deeper investigation to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts to prevent future attacks.
