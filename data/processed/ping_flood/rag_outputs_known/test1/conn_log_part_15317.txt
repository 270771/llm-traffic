Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (indicated by the ICMP code field being 0 and no type 8 specified), which is not an echo request (type 8). Additionally, there is only one ICMP connection instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single log entry. Further investigation would require more data showing multiple ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the same source to the same destination to confirm a ping flood.
