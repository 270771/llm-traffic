Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria specify at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 suffice to confirm a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not indicated here).
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121 is the attacker; destination IPs include 163.252.18.127, 163.252.90.233, 163.252.252.126, and others as listed.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic originating from 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 16.172.102.121 to identify compromise or misuse.
- Monitor network for further ICMP anomalies and implement ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS.
- Notify affected destination IP owners if within your administrative domain.
- Consider deploying network-level ICMP flood mitigation tools or services.

Heuristic assignment: Most likely heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
