Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.115.224.159. This high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and 52.158.x.x ranges are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 3.115.224.159 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.115.224.159.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP flood behavior.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature tuned for ICMP flood detection.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service on the targeted host.
