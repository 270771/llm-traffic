Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP without known exceptions. This matches heuristic 20 (common in ping flood detection taxonomies).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack" via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.150.144, 133.247.166.101, 133.247.31.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy network-based anomaly detection to monitor and alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Conduct a forensic review of the affected host 54.229.78.71 to assess impact and ensure no further compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume escalates.
