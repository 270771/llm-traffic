Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.
- There are only two ICMP packets total, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other types of attacks.
- ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which may be normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than attack traffic.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or checking for other anomaly indicators if available.
