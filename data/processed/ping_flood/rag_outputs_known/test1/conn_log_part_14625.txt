Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.9.52, 157.17.0.93, 157.17.196.57, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 161.67.57.135.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse, as they appear to be participating in the flood.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or command-and-control activity.
  5. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service impact on 161.67.57.135.
