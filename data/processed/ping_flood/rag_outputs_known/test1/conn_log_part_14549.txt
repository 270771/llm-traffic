Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance appears once in the snippet (from 133.247.185.196 to 157.187.159.183).  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant for ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or checking for other suspicious traffic patterns.
