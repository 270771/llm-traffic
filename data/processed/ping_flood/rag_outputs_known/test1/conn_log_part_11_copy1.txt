Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic in the log shows multiple entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but the total count of such instances from a single source to a single destination does not reach the threshold of at least 10 repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, except for the cluster of packets targeting 3.30.218.60. However, these packets come from multiple distinct source IPs (133.240.x.x range) rather than a single source flooding one target, which is more indicative of distributed scanning or benign echo requests rather than a classic ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.

Recommendation: Investigate the cluster of ICMP type 8 packets targeting 3.30.218.60 further to determine if this is coordinated scanning or a low-rate distributed ping attempt. Monitor for any increase in volume or repetition from single IPs. If volume spikes or source IPs consolidate, reassess for ping flood conditions.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned at this time.
