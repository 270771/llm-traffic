Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IP 52.175.248.229 from many different source IPs, indicating a high volume of ping requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination without legitimate responses indicate a ping flood (heuristic 20 is referenced in the instructions as relevant to known anomalous IPs, but none are found here).
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.250.88, 157.17.168.130, 130.197.150.36, etc., all targeting destination IP 52.175.248.229 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 52.175.248.229.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP ranges that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host 52.175.248.229 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled to prevent future flooding.
