Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 16.160.152.89 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession to a single target.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.248.8, 133.228.189.248, 133.228.124.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 16.160.152.89 for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Engage upstream providers or internal network teams to trace and mitigate the source of the flood.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider temporary blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious regions.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack requiring immediate mitigation.
