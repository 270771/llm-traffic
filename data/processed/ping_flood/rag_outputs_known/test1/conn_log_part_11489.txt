Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.83.92.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.211.193, 133.228.211.189, 133.228.214.27, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor the target IP 3.83.92.175 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or firewall teams to block or mitigate traffic from the suspicious source IPs.
- Conduct a deeper investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests in real time.
