Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 13.86.188.134 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets without known exceptions. This matches the observed data.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.134.55, 133.247.81.6, 133.247.171.166, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 13.86.188.134 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no source or destination ports (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 13.86.188.134.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified sources if the attack persists.
  5. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
