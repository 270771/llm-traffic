Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) traffic is normal network behavior and not indicative of flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or anomalies.  
- Investigate if the source IP 112.176.48.205 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests to 203.78.197.20.
