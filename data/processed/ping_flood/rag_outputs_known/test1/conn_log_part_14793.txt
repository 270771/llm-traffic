Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly not 8 (echo request). Only two entries have ICMP type 8, and each appears only once. The other entries have types 3 and 128, which are not echo requests.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here (no anomaly data found).  
- The traffic does not show repeated echo requests from the same source to the same destination in high volume, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and 128 (echo reply) are normal ICMP message types and do not suggest flooding or scanning.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and patterns is recommended to detect any emerging anomalies.
