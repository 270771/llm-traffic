Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.183.65.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (e.g., 130.197.150.62, 54.200.201.221) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.183.65.24. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.183.65.24.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or blacklist the identified source IPs sending excessive ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Deploy or verify existing Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
