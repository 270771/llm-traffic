Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 traffic may be related to traceroute or routing issues, which is normal in many networks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 sending multiple ICMP type 11 packets to various destinations to ensure this is expected behavior and not part of a reconnaissance or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
