Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.239.183.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of more than 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to a single destination strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.239.183.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.239.183.175.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Monitor network and host performance metrics for signs of service degradation or failure.
