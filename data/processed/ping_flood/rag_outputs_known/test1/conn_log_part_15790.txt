Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack. Assigning heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate based on standard cybersecurity taxonomies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.81.207, 163.252.252.234, 163.252.27.231, 163.252.90.234, 163.252.90.244, 163.252.76.6, 163.252.252.237, 163.252.139.145, 163.252.205.57, 163.252.242.182, 163.252.46.156, 163.252.239.32, 163.252.205.54, 163.252.35.198, 163.252.252.235, 163.252.242.139, 163.252.139.65, 163.252.222.6, 163.252.242.136.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network devices and affected hosts for signs of service degradation or outages.
3. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
