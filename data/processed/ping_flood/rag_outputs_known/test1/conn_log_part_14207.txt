Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.36.162.241) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances targeting a single host.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range (e.g., 133.247.124.138, 133.247.128.143, 133.247.189.36, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.36.162.241. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP (18.36.162.241).
  2. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP floods.
  4. Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.
  5. If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches the network.
