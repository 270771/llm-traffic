Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly not 8 (echo request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 as the destination port (which is unusual and likely a parsing artifact), and the rest are different or zero.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets without the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are matched, no immediate security response is required.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated echo requests from single IPs.
