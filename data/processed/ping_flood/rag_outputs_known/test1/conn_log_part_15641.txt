Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (known for detecting ICMP flood patterns) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.205.57, 163.252.3.158, 163.252.139.113, 163.252.91.204, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect lateral movement or amplification.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS and consider deploying traffic shaping to mitigate impact.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic while allowing legitimate network diagnostics.
