Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present, but only 6 distinct connections with ICMP type 8 to the same destination IP (35.169.51.96) are observed, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (1, 13) are present but do not indicate ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unexpected or unknown in the environment.
