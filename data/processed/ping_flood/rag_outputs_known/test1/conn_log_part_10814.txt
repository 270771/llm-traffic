Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating predominantly from IP 54.200.201.221 targeting numerous destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood: high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations, aiming to overwhelm the targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (known anomalous IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" in typical anomaly taxonomies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.200.201.221; Destination IPs include 203.78.188.123, 203.78.178.89, 203.78.181.175, 203.78.170.60, 203.78.183.44, 203.78.171.214, 203.78.170.57, 203.78.187.167, 203.78.171.208, 203.78.185.117, 203.78.171.209, 203.78.187.163, 203.78.187.162, 203.78.174.89, 203.78.185.114, among others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm echo requests (type 8, code 0).

Security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.200.201.221 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on affected destination IPs.
3. Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 54.200.201.221 to determine if it is a known malicious actor.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
5. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to detect and mitigate future ping flood attempts proactively.
