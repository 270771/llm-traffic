Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: ICMP flood detection).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.8.55, 163.252.164.1, 163.252.104.17, 163.252.248.192, 163.252.103.252, 163.252.140.91, 163.252.140.94, 163.252.239.239, 163.252.150.90, 163.252.129.152, 163.252.150.104, 163.252.4.129, 163.252.231.55, 163.252.8.247, 163.252.158.32, 163.252.186.3, 163.252.231.131, 163.252.231.61, 163.252.103.148.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential lateral movement or reconnaissance.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected network segments.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar volumetric ICMP attacks in the future.
