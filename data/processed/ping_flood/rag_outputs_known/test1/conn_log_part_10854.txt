Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood detection. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (from 133.247.253.75 to 52.250.47.198), and it appears only once.
- The requirement is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The other ICMP entries have types 128 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or checking other logs for repeated ICMP traffic patterns.
