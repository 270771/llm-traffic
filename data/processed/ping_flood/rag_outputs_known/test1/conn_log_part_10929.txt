Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: ICMP flood detection).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.80.126.221; Destination IPs include 203.78.178.88, 203.78.183.93, 203.78.189.230, 203.78.189.228, 203.78.180.20, 203.78.174.89, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.188.185, 203.78.167.1, 203.78.178.198, 203.78.173.222, 203.78.187.187, 203.78.173.218, 203.78.186.52, 203.78.170.64.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.80.126.221 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation or service impact.
3. Investigate the source host 3.80.126.221 for compromise or misuse.
4. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service disruption.
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
