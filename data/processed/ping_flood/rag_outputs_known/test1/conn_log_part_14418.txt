Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two: one from 52.158.11.176 to 163.252.4.221, and one from 157.17.55.112 to 3.115.224.159. This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are types 0, 3, and 13, which do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not part of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) messages may be normal network behavior or unrelated anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 13 messages if unusual network behavior is observed.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
