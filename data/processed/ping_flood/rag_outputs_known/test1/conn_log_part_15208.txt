Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request," which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests, especially if counts exceed 10 or involve suspicious IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
