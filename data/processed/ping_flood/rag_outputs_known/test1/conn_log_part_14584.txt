Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries; all records are either TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP and UDP connections mostly show single attempts with no signs of flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP traffic specifically, filtering for type 8 packets.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 flagged IPs.
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential volumetric or protocol-specific attacks.
