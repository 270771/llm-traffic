Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only two ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are present, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs. If the count rises above 10 or if anomaly data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
