Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only one ICMP entry with type 8 (echo request) is present: from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.121.
- The other ICMP entries have types 3, 10, and 11, which are not echo requests and thus not ping floods.
- The requirement for at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to indicate a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
