Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 65.234.113.148, all targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Alert the incident response team to prepare for potential escalation and further forensic analysis.
