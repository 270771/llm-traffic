Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.239.183.175) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641790842.22). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) typically classified under "Denial of Service" (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range; destination IP 54.239.183.175; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.239.183.175.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from suspicious source IPs in the 157.161.0.0/16 subnet.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ongoing ping floods.
