Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 157.17.234.185 to 143.52.95.234, with a single instance (count = 1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability issues but does not indicate flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages if network connectivity problems are suspected.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
