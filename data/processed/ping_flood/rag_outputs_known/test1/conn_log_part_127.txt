Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances (24 entries) of ICMP type 8 from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; Destination IPs include 133.250.64.36, 163.21.29.224, 163.21.163.253, and multiple others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation on targeted destination IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
