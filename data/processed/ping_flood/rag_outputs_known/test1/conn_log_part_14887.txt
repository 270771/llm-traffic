Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets required for a ping flood are absent. The snippet shows ICMP types 3 and 13, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not Echo Requests.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances, and none at all in this snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 and 13 messages can be part of normal network operations or other issues but do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes, especially repeated Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns over time.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues.
