Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating predominantly from IP 133.16.14.149 targeting numerous destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the primary attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 184.205.76.1, 23.76.34.4, 90.32.69.222, 104.88.127.7, 104.78.120.4, 23.73.181.254, 3.186.223.141, 23.214.213.250, 23.73.57.9, 23.188.27.8, and 104.127.239.5.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (echo request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
