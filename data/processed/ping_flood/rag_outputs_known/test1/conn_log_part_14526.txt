Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one record with ICMP type 8, showing 10 packets, which is the minimum threshold. However, this is a single instance and does not indicate a flood pattern by itself.
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports.
- The traffic does not show repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a destination that would indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 52.188.63.191 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect more data or anomaly records to correlate with potential suspicious activity.
