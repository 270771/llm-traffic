Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.237.185.15, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others, all targeting destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP type 8.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.237.185.15.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact and consider upstream provider coordination to filter attack traffic.
