Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 3.2.252.71 to two different destinations). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of a few ICMP echo requests is normal network behavior.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or heuristic matches once available.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.
