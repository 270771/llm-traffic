Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 143.224.65.254 to multiple destination IPs in the 163.210.95.x range. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.65.254; Destination IPs include 163.210.95.16, 163.210.95.17, 163.210.95.18, 163.210.95.19, 163.210.95.21, 163.210.95.24, 163.210.95.25, 163.210.95.26, 163.210.95.27, 163.210.95.29, 163.210.95.30, 163.210.95.31, 163.210.95.57, 163.210.95.58, 163.210.95.59, 163.210.95.60, 163.210.95.61, 163.210.95.62, 163.210.95.63.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8 for these entries.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 143.224.65.254 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures to prevent recurrence.
