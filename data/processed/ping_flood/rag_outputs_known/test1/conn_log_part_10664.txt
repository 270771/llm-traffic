Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 34.44.165.118 is repeatedly targeted by many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are flooding destination IPs 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic if possible.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
  5. Alert incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
