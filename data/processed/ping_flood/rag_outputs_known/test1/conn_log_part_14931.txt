Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears multiple times, but the total count of such instances targeting the same destination IP (3.116.11.97) is 7, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 0, 3, 11, 128, 129) do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.
- The traffic pattern shows multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination, but the volume is insufficient to classify as a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may warrant routine network troubleshooting but do not indicate an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor the volume of ICMP Echo Requests to see if it increases beyond the threshold.
- Investigate the destination IP 3.116.11.97 for any service issues or misconfigurations causing multiple ICMP requests.
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
