Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values other than 8 (echo request). Only one record has ICMP type 8 with a count of 8 packets, which is below the threshold of 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The traffic does not show a high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source to a destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious behavior.  
- Investigate the sources 13.242.241.56 and 203.78.177.156 if ICMP traffic volume increases, as they are the only sources sending ICMP type 8 packets here.
