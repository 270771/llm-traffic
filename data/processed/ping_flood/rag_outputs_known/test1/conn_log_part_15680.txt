Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not specified as 8 (echo request), and only one occurrence is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or related anomalies, this traffic appears benign or unrelated to flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs. Collect more connection logs to identify any emerging patterns of repeated ICMP echo requests that could indicate a ping flood.
