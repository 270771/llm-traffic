Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 52.181.17.215 from many different source IPs within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and 54.156.112.136 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify the affected system owners and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
