Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (4th column) shows values 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 entries with ICMP type 8 (src IPs 143.52.88.224 and 139.179.133.57), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The other entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 traffic may warrant routine network troubleshooting but does not indicate an attack per the given criteria.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if ICMP type 11 messages correlate with routing or network issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect any emerging patterns.
