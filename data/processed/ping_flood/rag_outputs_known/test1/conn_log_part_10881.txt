Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 52.42.116.124
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.252.246.176, 163.252.13.220, 163.252.151.201, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust filtering rules accordingly.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
