Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.127.34.186 within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume and multiplicity of unique source IPs sending these requests strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood / Ping Flood" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.136.207, 133.247.34.244, 133.247.35.138, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.127.34.186 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 35.127.34.186 for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
