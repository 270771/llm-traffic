Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.238.213.5, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies were explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, but the heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as per your instructions, heuristic 20 relates to known anomalous IPs or ping flood patterns).
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.216.193, 133.228.213.1, 133.228.213.7, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 52.238.213.5 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible.
