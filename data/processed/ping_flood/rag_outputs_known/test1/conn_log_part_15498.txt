Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Since ICMP type 3 indicates error messages rather than flooding, this traffic likely reflects normal network diagnostics or transient issues.

No further immediate investigation is required for ping flood, but monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated error messages could be prudent.
