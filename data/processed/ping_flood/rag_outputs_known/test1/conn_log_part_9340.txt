Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.254.250.38 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ICMP ping flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: ICMP flood).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs including 163.252.38.250, 163.252.38.42, 163.252.43.129, 163.252.40.244, 163.252.40.254, 163.252.171.110, 163.252.38.248, 163.252.43.117, 163.252.40.114, 163.252.31.20, and 163.252.31.72.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and affected parties about the ongoing attack.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Investigate upstream providers or contact the ISP responsible for 54.254.250.38 to report abuse and request mitigation support.
