Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, which is consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are sending ICMP echo requests to destination IP 52.181.17.215. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.181.17.215.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar patterns.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider blackholing traffic if the attack escalates.
