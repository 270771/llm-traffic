Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume and concentration of these requests from multiple source IPs strongly indicate a flooding attempt.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request Flood").
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the destination host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation if necessary.
