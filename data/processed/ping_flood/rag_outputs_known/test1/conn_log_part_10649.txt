Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types in these entries are 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from many sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of ICMP-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.175.34, 133.247.240.10, 133.247.175.154, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 3.116.11.97.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
- If possible, configure the target host firewall to drop ICMP echo requests temporarily to mitigate impact.
