Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 163.171.168.73 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly exceeded here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.139.243, 163.252.81.198, 163.252.41.211, 163.252.235.239, 133.251.127.202, 203.78.190.226, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Assigning heuristic number 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack" as the most likely labels given the pattern.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
