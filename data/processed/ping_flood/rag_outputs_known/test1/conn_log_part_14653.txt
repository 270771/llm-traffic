Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 203.78.178.13) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so port 0 is standard here).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact and prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
