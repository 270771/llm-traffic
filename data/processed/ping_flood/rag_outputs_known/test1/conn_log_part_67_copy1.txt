Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type field set to 0 in the conn.log snippet (the 4th field after source IP is always 11 or 3, which is the source port field, but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 anywhere). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (echo request), these are not ping requests.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (actually none), so the threshold for ping flood detection is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would override the count requirement.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets of other types, possibly echo replies or other ICMP message types, but not echo requests.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the exact ICMP type codes in the raw packet captures or logs to confirm the nature of these ICMP packets.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.65.114.222 or other hosts.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for signs of reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
