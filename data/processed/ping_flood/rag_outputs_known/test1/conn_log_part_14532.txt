Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries targeting 69.47.68.48 are present but only 7 instances are visible in the snippet (from IPs 133.247.148.22, 133.247.136.197, 133.247.137.238, 133.247.82.175, 133.247.35.69, 133.247.7.211, and 133.247.107.195).
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here (no anomaly data found).
- Other ICMP types (1 and 3) are present but do not indicate ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest a different attack type.

No attack is present. The traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood (heuristic 20 or equivalent). Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 volume or checking for other anomaly indicators in extended logs.
