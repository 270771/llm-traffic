Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 5 instances are observed targeting 35.173.100.241 from different source IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Other ICMP types present (3 and 0) do not indicate ping flood activity. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated requests from the same source IPs. Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect evolving patterns.
