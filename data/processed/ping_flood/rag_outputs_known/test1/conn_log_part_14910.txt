Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may warrant investigation into possible network issues or traceroute activity but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity.
