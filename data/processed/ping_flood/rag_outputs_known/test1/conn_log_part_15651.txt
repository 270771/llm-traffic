Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.71.218, 157.17.175.184, 157.17.8.40, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 35.169.51.96.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for performance degradation or service impact.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are external and not part of legitimate traffic.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
