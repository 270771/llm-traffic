Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values other than 8 in the relevant positions (e.g., some entries have ICMP type 0 or 8, but not consistently type 8 as the source type).  
- There are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic observed, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known malicious actors or match heuristic 20.  
- The traffic pattern does not show the volume or repetition typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly detection tools to identify if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if any other network performance issues coincide with this traffic.
