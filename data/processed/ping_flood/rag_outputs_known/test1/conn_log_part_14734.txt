Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 8 and 128. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but type 128 is an ICMPv6 Echo Request, which is different and not considered here.
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 23.88.14.140 to 133.251.127.232), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.
- The traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood, which requires multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests targeting a host.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
- Investigate the IPv6 ICMP traffic (type 128) separately, as it may require different analysis.
