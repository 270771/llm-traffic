Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 52.238.213.5, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.131.197, 133.228.254.0, 133.228.119.198, etc.) all targeting destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 52.238.213.5.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host and consider temporarily isolating it if service degradation occurs.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic from suspicious sources.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
