Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the anomaly CSV to suggest otherwise. Without heuristic context, the default interpretation is that this is normal ICMP diagnostic traffic or a traceroute-related message, not a flood.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed, but monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic could be prudent.
