Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance of type 8 is present (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.117). The other entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, only one ICMP type 8 packet is logged, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided.  
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types or suspicious behavior.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs or checking other logs for repeated ICMP traffic patterns.
