Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.253.198, 133.228.204.111, 18.112.90.42) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP 3.83.92.175, indicating a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame strongly match known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous IPs in ping floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to flooding ICMP Echo Requests.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.228.253.198, 133.228.204.111, 18.112.90.42, among others.
- Destination IP: 3.83.92.175
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 3.83.92.175.
- Notify network operations to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting persistent offending source IPs at firewall or router level.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if the destination host is compromised or if the attack is part of a larger coordinated campaign.
