Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided log, only two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (3.89.103.26 → 203.78.186.205 and 61.1.51.193 → 18.36.162.241). However, there are only two such instances, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other entries have ICMP type values of 0 or 8 in the destination port field, which does not indicate a flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The OTH (other) state and low packet counts do not indicate a volumetric or sustained attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated failed connection states.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
