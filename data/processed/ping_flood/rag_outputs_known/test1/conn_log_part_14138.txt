Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8, which is present in 5 entries targeting 3.231.100.178. However, the count of ICMP type 8 instances is only 5, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved.  
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context provided to suggest these IPs are known malicious actors or that heuristic 20 applies.  
- One ICMP entry with type 13 (timestamp request) is present, which is unrelated to ping floods.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume of ICMP echo requests suggests normal or low-level scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume to or from 3.231.100.178.  
- Investigate if 3.231.100.178 or the source IPs have any prior history of suspicious activity.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to better classify future events.
