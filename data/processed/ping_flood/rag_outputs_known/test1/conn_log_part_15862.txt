Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source from 59.41.190.221, all targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.228.4.24.
- Investigate and potentially block the source IP addresses at the firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
