Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The ICMP types present are 7, 8, and 3, but the single type 8 entry (second line) is only one instance, far below the threshold of 10.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns, which require multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 7 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
- Investigate the source IP 196.203.65.32 sending the single ICMP type 8 packet if unusual behavior is suspected.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
