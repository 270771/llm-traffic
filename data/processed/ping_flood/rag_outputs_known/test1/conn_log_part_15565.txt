Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, not 8, which means this is not an echo request (ping) packet. Ping flood attacks specifically require multiple ICMP type 8 packets. Additionally, there is only one instance shown, far below the threshold of 10 required for detection unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are typically normal network control traffic rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages could be useful to investigate potential network misconfigurations or other issues.
