Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from the same source IP (139.179.133.57) to two different destination IPs (203.78.173.225 and 203.78.173.226). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a source to a destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS by themselves.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in higher volumes.  
- Collect and integrate heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
