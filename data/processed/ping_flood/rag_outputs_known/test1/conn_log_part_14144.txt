Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the IP 3.231.100.178 from multiple source IPs, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood: many sources sending numerous ICMP echo requests to a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources such as 133.247.55.222, 133.247.48.240, 161.67.42.226, and others targeting destination 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 3.231.100.178.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for further amplification or spread to other hosts.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
