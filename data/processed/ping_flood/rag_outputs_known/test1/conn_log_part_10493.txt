Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack. Assigning heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate based on standard cybersecurity taxonomies.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.99.228, 163.252.67.26, 163.252.67.2, 163.252.99.193, 163.252.99.114, 163.252.42.251, 163.252.42.82, 163.252.88.20, 163.252.41.194, 163.252.88.22, and others as listed in the log. Ports are ICMP type 8 (no ports in ICMP, but type 8 is the key indicator).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential impact on targeted hosts.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts.
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches internal networks.
