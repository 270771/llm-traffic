Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets may be related to traceroute or routing issues, which are normal network behaviors.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or repeated ICMP type 11 messages over time.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential ICMP-based reconnaissance or other anomalies.  
- If heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate for other ICMP-related attacks.
