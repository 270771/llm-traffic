Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks.  
- The ICMP types present are 11, 3, and 1, which correspond to Time Exceeded, Destination Unreachable, and Echo Reply respectively, not indicative of a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic data available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could focus on the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
