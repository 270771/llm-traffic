Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 1 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and one from 210.122.60.57 are flooding the destination IP 52.181.17.215 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) and the single outlier (210.122.60.57) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 52.181.17.215 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
