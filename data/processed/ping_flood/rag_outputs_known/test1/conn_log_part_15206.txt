Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type 1 (ICMP type field in Zeek conn.log is the 4th field after source IP and port, here showing "1"), which corresponds to ICMP Echo Reply or other types, but not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping flood detection.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets; in fact, none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.
- The traffic shows isolated ICMP packets with type 1, which could be normal network activity or other ICMP messages, not a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly matches, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.
- Collect more detailed logs or anomaly data to detect other potential attacks.
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.106.1 if it repeatedly sends unusual ICMP traffic.
