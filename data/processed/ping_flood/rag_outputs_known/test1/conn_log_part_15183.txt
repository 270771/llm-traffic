Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with flooding behavior.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.28.176, 192.179.223.212, 133.247.242.216, etc.) are targeting the same destination IPs (notably 54.229.78.71 and 52.239.218.32), suggesting a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the affected destination IPs (54.229.78.71 and 52.239.218.32) at the network perimeter.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and adjust firewall rules accordingly.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts or botnet sources among the attacking IPs.
