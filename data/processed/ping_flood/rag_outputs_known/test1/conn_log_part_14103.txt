Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.166.249.180. This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from many sources to one destination.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.162.62, 133.247.169.131, 133.247.169.181, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.166.249.180. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" as the most likely labels.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 54.166.249.180 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume threatens network stability.
