Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0, 3, or 11 (as indicated by the 4th and 6th fields representing ICMP type and code). None have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request (ping) packets.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none at all.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning by themselves.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP error messages (types 3 or 11) if they persist, as they may indicate network issues or other anomalies.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
