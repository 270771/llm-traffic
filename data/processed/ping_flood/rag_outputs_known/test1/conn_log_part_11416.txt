Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a typical heuristic for ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust filtering rules accordingly.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other hosts potentially targeted or compromised.
- Alert the incident response team to investigate the source IP for possible compromise or malicious intent.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
