Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP entries have a dash ("-") in the type field, indicating no specific ICMP type 8 traffic is identified.  
- The number of ICMP entries with type 8 is zero or unknown, and the total ICMP counts (58 in two entries) do not confirm type 8 presence.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.  
- The traffic appears to be generic ICMP with no evidence of repeated Echo Requests from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail to confirm if any Echo Requests (type 8) are present.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding threshold counts from single IPs.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
