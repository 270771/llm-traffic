Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the same destination IP 52.190.120.127 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.16.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic that a ping flood involves at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.16.53.43, 133.16.207.8, 133.16.170.45, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.190.120.127.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation such as traffic scrubbing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
