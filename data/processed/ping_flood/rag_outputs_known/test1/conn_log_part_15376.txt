Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code 11 in the destination port field, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP connection instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 11 traffic could be related to normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more detailed ICMP type and count data for comprehensive analysis.
