Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional suspicious indicators, this traffic does not meet the threshold for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 139.179.133.57 to the destination 203.78.173.240. If the count rises above 10 or anomalies appear in future logs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP abuse.
