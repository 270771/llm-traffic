Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs to one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one outlier 45.32.19.188, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor network and host performance for signs of degradation or service impact.
