Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or high-volume ICMP traffic is evident.

No other attack type is indicated by this single log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly context, this traffic appears benign or isolated.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs to detect potential escalation. Collect more data to identify patterns or anomalies over time.
