Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 are present in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs from a single source IP.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from 52.236.221.123 to these or other destinations.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count exceeds the threshold for ping flood detection.  
- Investigate the source IP 52.236.221.123 if it continues to generate high ICMP traffic, as it could be a precursor to a flood or scanning activity.
