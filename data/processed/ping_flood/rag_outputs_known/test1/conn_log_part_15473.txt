Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- The connections mostly show SYN scans or failed TCP handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning activity but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies related to ICMP type 8, the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or heuristic 20 matches) are not met.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable detailed ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to detect potential ICMP floods.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once anomaly data is available.
