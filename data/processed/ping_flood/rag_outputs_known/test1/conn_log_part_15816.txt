Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) information, and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious source or destination IPs related to heuristic 20 or any other known ping flood indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. The connection state is OTH (other), and no payload or port information suggests alternative attack vectors.

Next steps: Collect more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs, including ICMP type details, and monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. Investigate if multiple such entries appear to confirm or rule out ping flood activity.
