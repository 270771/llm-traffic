Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown in the conn.log snippet, but the presence of ICMP traffic alone is insufficient.
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with no packets counted (0), and the second entry shows only 1 packet with ICMP.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which is the minimum threshold for detecting a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request counts from the same source IPs.
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information to confirm if type 8 packets are involved.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated connection attempts from the same IPs.
