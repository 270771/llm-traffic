Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the count threshold.  
- The connections show OTH (other) state with no retransmissions or unusual flags, indicating normal or low-volume ICMP traffic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential reconnaissance or low-rate scanning activity.
