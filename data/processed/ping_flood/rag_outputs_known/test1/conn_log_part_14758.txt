Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 11, not 8. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded." Neither corresponds to an echo request (type 8), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The observed ICMP traffic likely represents normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any new anomaly records appear related to these IPs or ICMP traffic.
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly taxonomy to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
