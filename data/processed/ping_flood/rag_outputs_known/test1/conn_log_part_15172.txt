Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.44.165.118 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20, which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.44.165.118 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.44.165.118.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
  5. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
