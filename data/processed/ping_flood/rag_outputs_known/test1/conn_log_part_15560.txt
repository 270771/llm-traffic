Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate normal ICMP error messaging. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible.

No immediate attack is detected; however, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
