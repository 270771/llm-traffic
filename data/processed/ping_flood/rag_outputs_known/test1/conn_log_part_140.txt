Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0, 3, or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
