Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 4 times in the snippet (entries with ICMP type 8: timestamps 1641099667.103580, 1641099661.047231, 1641099667.104740, and one more). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (1, 3, 13) do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic volume and pattern do not indicate a flood; the ICMP Echo Requests are sparse and from different source IPs to a single destination (13.86.188.134), which could be normal network activity or scanning.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) could be normal network error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to identify if any IPs become suspicious over time.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.196.73 and destination 13.86.188.134 for unusual activity if this pattern persists or intensifies.
