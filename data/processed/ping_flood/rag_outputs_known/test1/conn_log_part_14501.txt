Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could involve monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 122.211.61.16 to 163.252.122.34 to detect potential escalation.
