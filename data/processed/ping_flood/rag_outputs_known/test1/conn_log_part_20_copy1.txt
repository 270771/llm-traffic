Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from source IP 157.161.40.85 to various destinations, but there are only 2 such instances, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 is type 0 or other types, not type 8, so it does not match the ping flood pattern.  
- No known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override the count threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears normal or low volume.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source to multiple destinations.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.161.40.85 for unusual ICMP activity if volume increases.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
