Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 7 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified in the logs.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other sources. Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs become flagged under heuristic 20 or other heuristics. If the volume of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold or anomalies are detected, re-evaluate for ping flood activity.
