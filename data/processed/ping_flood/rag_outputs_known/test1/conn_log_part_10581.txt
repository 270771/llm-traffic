Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from source IP 35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The high frequency and volume of ICMP Echo Requests within a very short time frame strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic, which would likely be assigned heuristic number 20 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Attackers: 35.183.65.24, 34.25.134.27
  - Targets: Multiple IPs in 163.252.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 163.252.192.70, 163.252.244.124, 163.252.237.219, etc.)
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27).
2. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in blocking or mitigating traffic from these sources.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or escalation.
5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns to automate mitigation.
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any vulnerabilities exploited and update firewall/IDS rules accordingly.
