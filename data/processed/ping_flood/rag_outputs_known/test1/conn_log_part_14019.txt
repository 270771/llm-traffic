Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.173.100.241 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.94.58, 133.247.252.184, 133.247.245.115, etc.) are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical and consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 35.173.100.241.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources if attack volume escalates.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to volumetric DDoS mitigation services.
