Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 packets or anomaly flags, this traffic appears normal or unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies if they appear.
