Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.33.149.154 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.33.149.154 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the target host 34.33.149.154 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the flood traffic.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious regions.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
