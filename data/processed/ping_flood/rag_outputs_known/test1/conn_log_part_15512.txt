Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All provided conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies, no evidence supports a ping flood or related attack.

Recommendation:
- Continue monitoring for ICMP traffic, specifically type 8 packets.
- Investigate further if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to a destination IP exceeding 10 instances, which would meet the ping flood criteria.
- If anomalies appear, correlate with heuristic 20 (if available) for known suspicious IPs.
