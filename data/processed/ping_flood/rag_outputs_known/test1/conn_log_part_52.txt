Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 133.16.14.149 targeting multiple destination IPs, consistent with a ping flood pattern where a single source floods multiple targets.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 23.212.208.7, 204.108.95.7, 23.208.170.5, 104.75.142.4, 23.95.233.248, 204.171.85.209, 90.32.70.156, 173.40.86.5, 23.92.121.255, 104.87.194.7, 23.249.138.2, 23.247.4.8.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any other unusual ICMP traffic patterns from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to ensure no internal hosts are compromised and generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
