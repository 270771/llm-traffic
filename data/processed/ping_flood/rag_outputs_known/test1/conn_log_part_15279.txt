Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal ICMP control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving heuristic 20 or other heuristics if anomaly data becomes available.  
- Continue logging and correlating ICMP traffic patterns for early detection of potential ping floods.
