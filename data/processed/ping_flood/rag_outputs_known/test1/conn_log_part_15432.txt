Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 16.160.194.189 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- Each connection is from a different source IP in the 130.197.x.x range, indicating a distributed source pattern typical of ping flood attacks.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (130.197.154.60, 130.197.154.234, 130.197.60.125, etc.) targeting destination 16.160.194.189 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the target host 16.160.194.189 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
