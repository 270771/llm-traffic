Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern involves multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.17.174.242, 133.247.86.68, 157.17.60.6, 133.247.20.223) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55), consistent with a distributed ping flood targeting these hosts.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting one or few destinations in a short time frame.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily:
  - Sources: 157.17.174.242, 133.247.86.68, 157.17.60.6, 133.247.20.223, and others in the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges.
  - Destinations: 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs (52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required for operations.
