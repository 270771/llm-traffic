Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.116.11.97, which matches the pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target.
- All ICMP types involved are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, the presence of more than 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to a single destination strongly indicates a ping flood (heuristic 20 is the closest known heuristic for ICMP flood).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.55.222, 133.247.104.206, 133.247.236.238, etc.) are flooding destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.116.11.97.
- Investigate and block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are internal or known malicious.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential coordinated DDoS.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and apply host-based ICMP rate limiting or firewall rules.
