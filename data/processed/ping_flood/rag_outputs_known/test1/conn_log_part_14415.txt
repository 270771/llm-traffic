Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 3.115.224.159 from multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.171.130, 157.17.157.2, 157.17.232.124, 52.158.11.176, etc.), consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic rules for ping flood detection, this matches heuristic #20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from 157.17.x.x and 52.158.11.176; destination IP heavily targeted is 3.115.224.159.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor the targeted host 3.115.224.159 for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage network operations to trace and possibly filter traffic upstream to mitigate the flood.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., DDoS protection appliances or cloud-based scrubbing).
5. Log and alert on continued ICMP Echo Request surges to enable rapid response.

This is a clear case of an ongoing ICMP ping flood attack targeting 3.115.224.159.
