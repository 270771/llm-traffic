Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- Multiple unique source IPs (e.g., 157.17.76.171, 157.17.221.214, 157.17.188.237, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination IP 3.215.122.104, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets far exceed the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20 typically relates to ICMP flood patterns).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to overwhelming ICMP Echo Requests targeting one host.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple 157.17.x.x addresses (at least 20 unique sources)
- Destination IP: 3.215.122.104
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and throttle ICMP flood traffic.
- Monitor the destination host 3.215.122.104 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large and persistent.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited by the attackers.
