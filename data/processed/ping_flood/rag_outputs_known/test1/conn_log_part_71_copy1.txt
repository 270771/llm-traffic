Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type field values of 0, 3, or 11, but none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic appears to be various ICMP message types (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The absence of ICMP Echo Requests means no ping flood or similar ICMP-based volumetric attack is present.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity patterns or other protocols.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
