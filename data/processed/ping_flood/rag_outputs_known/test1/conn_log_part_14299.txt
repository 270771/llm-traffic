Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP, 3.231.100.178, targeting numerous distinct destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. There are well over 10 such instances in a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack where an attacker sends a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in rapid succession.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.231.100.178; Destination IPs include 163.252.10.139, 163.252.67.118, 163.252.134.193, 163.252.232.243, 163.252.232.93, 163.252.104.16, 163.252.151.211, 163.252.200.198, 163.252.38.42, 163.252.237.196, 163.252.237.217, 163.252.132.27.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.231.100.178 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to prevent amplification or reflection attacks.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
