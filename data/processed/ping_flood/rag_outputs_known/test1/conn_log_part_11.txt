Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 25 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.86.1 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) commonly used in anomaly taxonomies for denial-of-service attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.86.1; Destination IPs range across 203.114.237.184 to 203.114.237.209; ICMP type 8; no ports involved as ICMP is a layer 3 protocol.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.86.1 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination hosts and network performance.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 129.43.86.1 to identify compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic is saturating external links.
