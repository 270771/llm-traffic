Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), indicating incomplete or unusual connection states but not necessarily flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, these appear to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if these echo requests are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
