Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range (e.g., 133.247.110.213, 133.247.7.3, 133.247.82.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.193.126.151.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood (133.247.x.x range).
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or network peers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
