Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniformity of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and the destination IP 54.229.78.71. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.229.78.71.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
