Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from numerous source IPs to one destination matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack signature, where an attacker overwhelms the target with excessive ping requests to degrade service.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic 20 (known for detecting volumetric ICMP floods) as the most likely heuristic.  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service" (DoS) attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Target IP: 16.161.126.169 (destination of all ICMP type 8 packets)  
- Source IPs: Multiple distinct IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.226.116, 157.17.30.148, 157.17.18.160, etc.)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.  
2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to other DoS mitigation techniques (e.g., blackholing, scrubbing).  
5. Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and update threat intelligence feeds accordingly.
