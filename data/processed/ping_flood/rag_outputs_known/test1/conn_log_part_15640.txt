Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source without known exceptions.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily source 16.172.102.121 sending ICMP Echo Requests to various 163.252.x.x destination IPs. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this source.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host 16.172.102.121 to identify if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
