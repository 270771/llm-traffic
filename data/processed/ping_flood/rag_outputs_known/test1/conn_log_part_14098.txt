Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times in the snippet (lines with ICMP type 8: 133.247.246.96→54.193.126.151, 130.197.139.204→52.230.58.255, 130.197.139.51→52.230.58.255). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood. Other ICMP types present are not type 8, so they do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomalies or heuristic matches are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. There is no evidence of other attack types in the snippet.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If the count rises above 10 or if heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) is identified in future data, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) packets for potential network issues or scanning activity.
