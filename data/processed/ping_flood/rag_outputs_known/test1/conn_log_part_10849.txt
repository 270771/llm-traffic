Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP echo request (type 8) packets targeting the single destination IP 69.47.68.29 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All relevant ICMP packets have type 8, confirming they are echo requests (pings), and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard network security heuristics, this pattern aligns with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (130.197.23.195, 130.197.172.147, 130.197.144.133, 130.197.190.209, 130.197.144.193, 130.197.154.30, 130.197.140.80, 130.197.20.21, 130.197.21.159, 130.197.190.249) targeting destination 69.47.68.29 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target IP 69.47.68.29 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
