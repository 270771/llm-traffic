Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099675.55). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.169.51.96. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host (35.169.51.96) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to drop or limit ICMP traffic from suspicious sources.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 35.169.51.96, consistent with heuristic 20 (ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
