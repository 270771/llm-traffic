Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 2 and 1, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly flags, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP types or volumes if they increase, as they may indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
