Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP, 35.100.170.152, targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic that a ping flood involves 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly from one source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.100.170.152; Destination IPs include 163.252.103.166, 163.252.233.229, 163.252.233.75, 163.252.233.17, 163.252.103.130, 163.252.5.203, 163.252.48.1, 163.252.132.26, 163.252.103.210, 163.252.132.10.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 35.100.170.152 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP and related subnets.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
