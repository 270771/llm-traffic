Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows 22 total packets but the ICMP type field is 4, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the ping flood pattern. Additionally, only one connection record is present, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances is not met.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 4 typically indicates "Source Quench," which is a control message, not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if further ICMP traffic shows increasing volume or repeated Echo Requests.
