Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 8, and 3. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 45.32.19.188 to 163.252.103.140). The other two entries are type 11 (time exceeded) and type 3 (destination unreachable), which are not ping requests.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate normal network troubleshooting or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 45.32.19.188 if it sends repeated ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
