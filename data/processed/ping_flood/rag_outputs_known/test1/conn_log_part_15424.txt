Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only 1 instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or high-frequency ICMP traffic is evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly data, this traffic appears benign or incidental.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (3.70.110.240) to the destination (133.102.98.171). If counts rise above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
