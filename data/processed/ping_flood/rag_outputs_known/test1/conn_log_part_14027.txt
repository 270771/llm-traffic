Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.206.231.130, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs to one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source IP 133.247.80.53, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 54.206.231.130 for signs of resource exhaustion or service degradation.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
