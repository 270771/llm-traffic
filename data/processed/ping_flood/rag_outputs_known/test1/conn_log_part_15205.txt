Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.187.198 to destination 37.142.118.5, with a single instance (count = 1).
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.187.198 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
