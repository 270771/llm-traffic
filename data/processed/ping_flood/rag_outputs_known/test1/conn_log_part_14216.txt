Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are fewer than 10 instances in this snippet (only 7 distinct entries with ICMP type 8).  
- No anomalies or heuristic matches are found in the anomaly CSV to override the threshold.  
- ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is present but does not indicate a ping flood.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (e.g., 3.121.216.42, 52.158.11.176) show unusual traffic patterns or alerts in other logs.  
- Correlate with other network or IDS logs for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.
