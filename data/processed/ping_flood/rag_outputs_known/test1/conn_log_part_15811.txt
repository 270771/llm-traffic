Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one occurrence is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data provided. Without multiple ICMP echo requests (type 8) or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not match ping flood or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs. Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to detect potential emerging threats.
