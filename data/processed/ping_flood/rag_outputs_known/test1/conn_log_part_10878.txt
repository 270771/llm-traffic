Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request Flood").
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming network resources.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external to coordinate mitigation.
