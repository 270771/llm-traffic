Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single destination IP (3.231.100.178) from multiple distinct source IPs within a short time frame, indicating a coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.157.255, 133.247.157.244, 133.247.33.136, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
2. Monitor the target host (3.231.100.178) for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
5. Prepare incident response to mitigate potential collateral damage and document the attack for future reference.
