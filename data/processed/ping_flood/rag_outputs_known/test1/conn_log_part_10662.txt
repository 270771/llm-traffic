Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 11, 8, 8, and 10. Only type 8 corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs 133.247.255.177 and 133.247.164.193 if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests.
