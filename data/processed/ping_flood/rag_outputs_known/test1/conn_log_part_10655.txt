Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one ICMP packet with type 8 (echo request) is present in the snippet (timestamp 1641099638.838720).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 13, which are not echo requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP messages, possibly error or informational messages (types 3 = destination unreachable, 13 = timestamp request), which are normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (133.247.153.198, 133.228.240.125, 157.17.45.201) show repeated ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
