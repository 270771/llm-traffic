Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8, 0, and 11. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 222.88.115.42 to 133.102.35.50, and one instance of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 130.197.147.191 to 3.215.122.104. The count of ICMP type 8 packets is well below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (0 and 11) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in threat intelligence feeds or show other suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more detailed logs or packet captures if ICMP traffic volume increases.
