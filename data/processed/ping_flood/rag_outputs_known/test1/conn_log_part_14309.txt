Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet. The ICMP entries have a dash ("-") in the ICMP type field, indicating no type 8 packets are confirmed.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP packet types and counts to confirm if any type 8 (Echo Request) floods occur.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs.  
- Enable logging of ICMP type fields explicitly to improve detection accuracy.
