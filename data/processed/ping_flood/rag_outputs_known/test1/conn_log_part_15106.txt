Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 13.86.47.233 within a very short time window (~0.004 seconds). This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs to a single destination IP in rapid succession.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one destination IP 13.86.47.233. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the protocol and port is 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
  2. Monitor the target host 13.86.47.233 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules.
  4. Consider blacklisting persistent attacking IPs and engage upstream providers if attack volume escalates.
  5. Review and harden network infrastructure to prevent amplification or reflection attacks.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
