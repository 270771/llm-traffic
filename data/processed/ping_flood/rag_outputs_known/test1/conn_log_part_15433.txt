Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 16.160.194.189, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- All relevant ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 130.197.x.x subnet (e.g., 130.197.63.49, 130.197.63.158, 130.197.157.16, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 16.160.194.189 with ICMP Echo Requests on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor the target IP 16.160.194.189 for service degradation and consider isolating it from the network if impact is severe.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of similar ICMP floods.
- Engage with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
