Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.83.92.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.164.200, 133.228.185.247, 133.228.249.55, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.83.92.175.
  2. Investigate and isolate the source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet to determine if they are compromised hosts or misconfigured devices.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 3.83.92.175 and prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from identified malicious sources if attack volume persists.
