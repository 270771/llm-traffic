Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically related to network diagnostics or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate ICMP error messages, as this could indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.
