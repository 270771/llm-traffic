Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.116.11.97 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.0.167, 133.247.132.65, 133.247.166.177, etc.) flooding destination 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter.
- Monitor the destination IP 3.116.11.97 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.
