Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The traffic appears to be normal connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to monitor for potential ping floods.
- Enable ICMP logging in Zeek or other IDS tools to detect ICMP Echo Requests.
- Review network baseline for unusual TCP SYN floods or port scans, as some entries show many SYN attempts (S0) which could indicate scanning activity (heuristic 6 often relates to TCP SYN scans).
- Without heuristic context, treat these as normal connection attempts but remain vigilant for scanning behavior.
