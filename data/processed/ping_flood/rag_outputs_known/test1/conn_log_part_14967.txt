Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, the first entry shows ICMP type 8 as the destination port (203.78.173.246:0) but the source port is 8, which is unusual and the second entry shows ICMP type 0 as source port and 8 as destination port, indicating an ICMP reply rather than a request.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the behavior of IPs 139.179.133.57 and 211.156.88.104 if they continue to generate unusual ICMP traffic.
