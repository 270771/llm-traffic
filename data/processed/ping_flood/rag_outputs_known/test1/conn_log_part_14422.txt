Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged, the criteria for detecting a ping flood are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The traffic appears to be normal connection attempts or scans over TCP/UDP ports, with no evidence of ICMP flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IPs.
- If suspicious TCP/UDP scanning is suspected, apply heuristics related to port scanning or reconnaissance (commonly heuristic 10 or 11 in many taxonomies) for further analysis.
