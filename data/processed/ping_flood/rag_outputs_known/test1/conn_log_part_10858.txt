Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `185.210.18.166` to `203.78.191.254` with a single instance. There are no multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets indicating a flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 or 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) packets is normal network behavior and does not imply an attack here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any unusual spikes in ICMP traffic volume or patterns if they arise.
