Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) and the many unique source IPs (e.g., 157.17.18.137, 157.17.101.7, 157.17.158.175, etc.) targeting the same destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP 54.179.180.7; ICMP protocol, no ports (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a forensic review of the affected host 54.179.180.7 for any signs of compromise or service degradation.
