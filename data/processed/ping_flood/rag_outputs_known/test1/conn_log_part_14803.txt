Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.20, with a single instance logged. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack pattern is evident from the data. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or checking other logs for related anomalies.
