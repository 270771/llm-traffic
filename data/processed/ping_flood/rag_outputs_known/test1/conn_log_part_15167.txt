Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8 and 0, but the first entry shows ICMP type 8 as the source port and 0 as the destination port, which is inconsistent with typical ICMP type field usage. The second entry shows ICMP type 0 as source and 8 as destination, which is not a ping request (type 8 is echo request, type 0 is echo reply).
- There are only two ICMP entries total, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
- Investigate the behavior of IPs 203.78.177.156 and 133.228.185.129 if they continue to generate unusual ICMP traffic.
