Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are echo requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard network security heuristics, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range flooding the destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (52.230.228.52) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
