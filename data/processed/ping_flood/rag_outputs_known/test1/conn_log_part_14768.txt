Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8 respectively. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
