Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and whitelist trusted hosts if necessary.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
5. Implement or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate similar ICMP floods in the future.
