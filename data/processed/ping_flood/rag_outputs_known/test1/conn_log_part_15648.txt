Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from source IP 52.237.159.63 to various destination IPs (133.251.200.37, 133.251.201.197, 133.251.200.42, 133.251.200.33) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- There are at least 4 distinct ICMP type 8 entries within a very short time frame (~0.0086 seconds each), indicating rapid repeated ping requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the clustering of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to multiple destinations strongly suggests a ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly CSV data or heuristic context is provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Source IP 52.237.159.63; Destination IPs 133.251.200.37, 133.251.201.197, 133.251.200.42, 133.251.200.33; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.237.159.63 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems.
- Review and tighten ICMP handling policies to prevent similar attacks.
