Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) do not correspond to flooding or denial-of-service patterns.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential ping floods.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
