Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- All entries are either TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP protocol (protocol number 1) is present.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The heuristic for ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts or anomalies.
