Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 13. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one instance with ICMP type 8 is present (from 133.247.23.85 to 3.116.11.97).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is 1, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 13 = Timestamp Request) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 13 packets may be normal network behavior or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.23.85 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
