Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting two destination IPs: 35.173.100.241 and 34.25.86.31.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to the same destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" by standard DDoS attack classifications.
- Involved IPs:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges.
  - Destinations: 35.173.100.241 and 34.25.86.31.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IP ranges.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and block all malicious source IPs involved in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blackholing attack traffic.
- Monitor affected hosts (35.173.100.241 and 34.25.86.31) for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
