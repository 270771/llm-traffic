Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting primarily the IP 34.44.165.118, with multiple different source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.42.126 through 133.247.253.190 range; destination IP primarily 34.44.165.118; some traffic also targets 44.50.62.61 and other IPs.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the targeted host 34.44.165.118 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting 34.44.165.118, meeting the standard detection heuristic of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources.
