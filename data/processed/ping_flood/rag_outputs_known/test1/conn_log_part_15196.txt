Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping).  
- However, only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly routine network scanning or monitoring.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency or volume to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 173.235.215.101 if it continues to send multiple ICMP requests to various destination IPs in a short time frame, as this could indicate reconnaissance activity.  
- Obtain or define heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify and respond to such anomalies in the future.
