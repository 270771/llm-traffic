Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, these entries do not represent a flooding or denial-of-service pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing loops.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to detect other potential threats.
