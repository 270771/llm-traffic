Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting a single host) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.195.104, 157.17.151.193, 157.17.52.114, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the 157.17.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Prepare incident response to mitigate potential service disruption on 161.67.57.135 and notify affected stakeholders.
