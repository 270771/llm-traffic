Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present from source IP 52.42.116.124 to various destination IPs, the total count of such packets in the snippet is fewer than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known malicious IPs or exceptions (such as heuristic 20) that would lower this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP traffic appears to be normal echo requests rather than a volumetric flood.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP over a longer time window. Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect if these requests escalate into a flood or if the source IP is flagged by external threat intelligence.
