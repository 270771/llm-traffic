Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the IP 44.61.12.164 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, consistent with a high volume of echo requests typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.61.12.164 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.44.38, 163.252.254.9, 163.252.47.166, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 44.61.12.164 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on 44.61.12.164 to determine if it is compromised or being used as a bot.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.
