Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
