Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP entries are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) may be part of normal network diagnostics or unrelated traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies related to these IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
