Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.158.38.252) from multiple source IPs within the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources targeting one destination.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.161.158.30, 157.161.244.31, 157.161.244.123, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 18.158.38.252. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 18.158.38.252.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
  5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if not required for legitimate operations.
