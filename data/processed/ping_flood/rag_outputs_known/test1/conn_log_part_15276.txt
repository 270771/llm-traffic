Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically normal network control messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or attacks.
