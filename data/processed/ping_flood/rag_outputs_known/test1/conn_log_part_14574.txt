Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (from 54.9.51.14 to 163.252.71.235 and 163.252.71.183).
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types present (3 and 1) do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not part of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 1 (host unreachable) suggests normal network error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate the source IP 54.9.51.14 if it continues to send ICMP echo requests at a higher rate.
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
