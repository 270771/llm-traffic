Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 13.86.188.134 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.57.100, 133.247.43.193, 133.247.46.183, etc.) targeting destination IP 13.86.188.134 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 13.86.188.134 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
