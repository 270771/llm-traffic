Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values other than 8 (e.g., 1, 3, 0), and only two entries have ICMP type 8.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The traffic does not match the pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests (type 8) in volume or frequency indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP types 1 and 3 correspond to destination unreachable and echo reply or other control messages, which are normal network operations or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in source/destination IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
