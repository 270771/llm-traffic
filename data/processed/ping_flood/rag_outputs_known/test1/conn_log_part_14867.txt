Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic from source IP 163.171.168.73 to two different destination IPs. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The single ICMP type 11 entry is unrelated to ping floods (type 11 is Time Exceeded).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The low volume of ICMP Echo Requests suggests normal or benign activity.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic for increased volume or repeated Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 163.171.168.73 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
