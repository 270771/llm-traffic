Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 2 and 18, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP connection records, which is well below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (2 = Echo Reply, 18 = Address Mask Request) do not typically indicate flooding or DoS activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if more ICMP type 8 packets appear in extended logs.  
- Monitor for any heuristic 20 matches or other anomalies involving these IPs.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
