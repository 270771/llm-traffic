Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type used here, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and one from 163.252.9.202, all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent use of ICMP Echo Requests confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
