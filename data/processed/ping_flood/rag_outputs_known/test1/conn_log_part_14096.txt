Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.193.126.151.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network performance and logs for continued or escalating attack activity.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches the network.
