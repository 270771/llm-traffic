Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the log snippet are 11, 1, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are no entries with type 8, the traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  
- The observed ICMP types correspond to Time Exceeded (11), Destination Unreachable (3), Echo Reply (0 is missing here, but 1 is likely an error or different code), and other control messages, which are normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior or repeated error messages that might indicate network issues or other attack types.  
- Collect more data or logs with ICMP type 8 to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- If anomalies appear later, apply heuristics related to ICMP error message floods or reconnaissance.
