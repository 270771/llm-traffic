Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic states that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 should be present to confirm a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no ICMP traffic or anomalies are detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log may not log ICMP by default.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or use packet capture tools to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs.
