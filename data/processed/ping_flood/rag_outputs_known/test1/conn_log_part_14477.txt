Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically related to network diagnostics or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs 202.194.58.66 and 133.251.200.35 if they repeatedly generate unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
