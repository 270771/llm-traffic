Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are mostly 0 or 8, but only a few entries have type 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets overall (6 entries with type 8).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.  
- The presence of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets indicates normal ICMP traffic rather than a flood.  
- The traffic volume and pattern do not match typical ping flood behavior, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.
