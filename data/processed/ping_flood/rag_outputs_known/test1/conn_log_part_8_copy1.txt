Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic recorded.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic shows multiple TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, heuristic 20 (related to known anomalous IPs) and ping flood taxonomy do not apply.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically heuristic 1 or 2 in common taxonomies, but no explicit data is given.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts from IPs like 167.249.133.167 and 93.81.158.106 for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.
