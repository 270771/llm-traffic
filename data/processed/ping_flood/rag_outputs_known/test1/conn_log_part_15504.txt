Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type 0 or 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate if any new anomaly records appear related to these IPs.
- Collect heuristic context to better classify future anomalies.
