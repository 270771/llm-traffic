Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 163.171.168.73 to 163.252.12.9 with a single instance (count=1), which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.  
- Correlate with other network logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious behavior.
