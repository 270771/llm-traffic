Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 3.231.100.178 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the known heuristic that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to the same destination indicate a ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.149.114, 133.247.107.193, 133.247.129.140, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 to the victim IP 3.231.100.178.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and consider blacklisting persistent offending IPs.
- Engage incident response to verify if the victim host is impacted and apply host-based protections.
- If possible, coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack closer to the source.
- Enable logging and alerting on ICMP traffic anomalies to detect recurrence early.
