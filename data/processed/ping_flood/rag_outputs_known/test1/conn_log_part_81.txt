Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple entries show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from the IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a short time window, matching the threshold for ping flood detection.
- The traffic pattern is consistent with a ping flood: a single source IP sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destinations rapidly.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IP: 133.16.14.149
- Destination IPs: Multiple (e.g., 104.112.204.253, 23.246.143.5, 104.75.128.246, 104.117.213.250, 23.251.26.4, 5.78.209.94, 2.210.143.4, 23.246.40.5, 23.245.4.0, 23.247.53.255, 23.231.228.246, 184.206.188.4)
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or other suspicious sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to ensure no compromised hosts are generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
- Consider implementing ICMP rate limiting or disabling ICMP Echo Requests if not required for network operations.
