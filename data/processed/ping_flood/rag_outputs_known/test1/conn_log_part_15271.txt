Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, the fundamental condition for detecting a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise or indicate known suspicious IPs related to ICMP traffic.  
- The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts further as they may indicate a port scan or other reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristic 20 if available in future data to detect suspicious IPs related to ICMP floods.  
- Monitor for ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods in subsequent logs.
