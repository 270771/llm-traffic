Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 8, and 129. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance with ICMP type 8 (from 133.228.186.106 to 52.181.47.160), which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (0 and 129) are not indicative of ping flood attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.186.106 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
