Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.33.149.154 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single host.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.144.235, 133.247.40.236, 133.247.27.190, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.33.149.154. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.33.149.154.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the targeted host.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP ranges if attack volume escalates.
