Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (line with src IP 139.179.133.57 and dst IP 203.78.173.71).  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (such as heuristic 20) are present to override this.  
- No anomaly records are found in the CSV to suggest suspicious IPs or ports.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from single IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect evolving threats.
