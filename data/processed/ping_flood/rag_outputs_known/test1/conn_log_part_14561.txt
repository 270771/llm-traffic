Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.9.51.14) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flooding) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
