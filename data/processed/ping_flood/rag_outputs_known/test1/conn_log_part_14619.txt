Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.165.156, 157.17.75.109, 157.17.102.95, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack.
  5. Log and alert on continued ICMP flood patterns for ongoing incident response.
