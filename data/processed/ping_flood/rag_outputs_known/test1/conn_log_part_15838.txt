Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099676). This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which typically falls under heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host (52.236.221.123) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the offending source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
