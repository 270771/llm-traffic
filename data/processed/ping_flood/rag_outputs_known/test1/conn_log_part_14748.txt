Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 8 (Echo Request) and 11 (Time Exceeded). However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 222.88.115.42 and 139.179.133.57). This is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records exist in the provided CSV.  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 packets (TTL exceeded) suggests normal network diagnostic or routing issues rather than flooding.  

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 packets if network routing issues are suspected.  
- Establish heuristics and taxonomy definitions for future anomaly correlation.
