Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values present are 3 and 8. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (from 54.221.141.21 to two different destinations), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability or misconfigurations but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Correlate with broader network logs to detect potential scanning or denial-of-service attempts.
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages to ensure network paths are functioning correctly.
