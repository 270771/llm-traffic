Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 1, typically classified under "Denial of Service" taxonomy).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.228.x.x subnet and others (157.17.226.96, 133.228.252.55, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 68.104.133.69. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders.
