Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs all sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (54.229.78.71) within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts overwhelm a target with echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous source IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host (54.229.78.71) for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking sources.
4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses and take remediation actions accordingly.
