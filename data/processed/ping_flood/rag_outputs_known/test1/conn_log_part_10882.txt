Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source").
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; Destination IPs include 163.252.146.203, 163.252.45.219, 163.252.7.94, 163.252.146.1, 163.252.3.154, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
5. Review upstream provider filtering options to prevent further attack traffic from this source IP.
