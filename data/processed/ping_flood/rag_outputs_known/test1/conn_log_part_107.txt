Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.158.38.252 from multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.161.250.248, 157.161.129.212, 157.161.105.171, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 18.158.38.252.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing and coordinate with upstream providers to block malicious traffic.
  5. Consider enabling ICMP flood protection features on firewalls and routers to mitigate ongoing attack impact.
