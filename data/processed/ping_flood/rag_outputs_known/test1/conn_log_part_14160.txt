Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.220.233.141) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly exceeded here.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 54.220.233.141 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple in the 163.252.x.x range
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential impact on the targeted hosts.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review upstream filtering policies with the ISP to prevent amplification or reflection attacks.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
