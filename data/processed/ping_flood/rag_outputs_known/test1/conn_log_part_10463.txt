Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as ping flood traffic.
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 could be related to traceroute or TTL expiry, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify any emerging patterns.
- Investigate if the source IP 157.17.228.46 or destination IP 44.61.16.153 appear in other suspicious contexts.
