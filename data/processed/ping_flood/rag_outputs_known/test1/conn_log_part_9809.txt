Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 packets are sent from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range targeting two main destination IPs: 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches were found in the anomaly CSV, but the pattern of multiple sources sending numerous ICMP echo requests to the same destinations aligns with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, and the heuristic number can be assigned as 1 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection based on volume and type).

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: Multiple IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.247.126.15, 133.247.129.140, 133.247.243.59, etc.)
- Destinations: 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are 0 or irrelevant.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IP range is known to be malicious or outside expected operational regions.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
