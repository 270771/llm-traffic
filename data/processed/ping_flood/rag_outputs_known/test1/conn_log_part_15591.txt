Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8, which is present in multiple entries.  
- However, the number of ICMP type 8 instances targeting a single destination IP (16.160.152.89) is 8 entries, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest exceptions or known suspicious IPs that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types present (type 3) are unrelated to ping floods and indicate different ICMP messages (e.g., destination unreachable).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate network diagnostics or low-level scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unknown or unexpected in the network environment.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, re-evaluate with that context.
