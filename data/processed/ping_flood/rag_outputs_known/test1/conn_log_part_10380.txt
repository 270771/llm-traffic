Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, but there are only 5 instances targeting a single IP (18.22.151.10) within the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- The other ICMP entries either have different types (e.g., type 0 or 11) or different destination IPs, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (such as heuristic 20) are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a volumetric flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets (133.247.*.*) for any unusual behavior or reputation issues.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
