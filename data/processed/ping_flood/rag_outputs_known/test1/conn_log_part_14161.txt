Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.220.233.141 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; Destination IPs include 163.252.244.81, 163.252.136.214, 163.252.170.185, 163.252.147.29, 163.252.147.59, 163.252.115.79, 163.252.255.236, 163.252.238.126, 163.252.103.141, 163.252.103.224, 163.252.115.93, 163.252.180.207, 163.252.237.235, 163.252.3.11, 163.252.182.249, 163.252.19.100, 163.252.3.62, 163.252.103.130.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or packet loss caused by this flood.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential collateral impact.
- Review and update network policies to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic and consider deploying ICMP rate limiting globally.
