Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic matches (such as heuristic 20) are present to override this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (54.220.233.141) to multiple destinations, as this pattern could escalate into a ping flood. Collect more extended logs to verify if the threshold of 10+ ICMP echo requests is met over a short time window. Investigate the source IP for any known malicious activity or reputation issues.
