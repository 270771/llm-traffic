Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.115.224.159 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (157.17.100.253, 157.17.190.91, 157.17.100.1, 157.17.238.51, 157.17.250.176, 157.17.237.254, 157.17.250.218, 157.17.189.39, 157.17.237.193, 157.17.49.222, 157.17.173.15, 157.17.165.154, 157.17.165.150, 157.17.158.161) flooding destination IP 3.115.224.159 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.115.224.159.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with ICMP flood detection capabilities.
- Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation or denial.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
