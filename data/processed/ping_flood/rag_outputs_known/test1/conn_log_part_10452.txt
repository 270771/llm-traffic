Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 44.61.16.153, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.175.234, 157.17.68.39, 157.17.188.126) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 44.61.16.153.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
  4. Engage incident response to investigate potential compromise of source hosts.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns in real time.
