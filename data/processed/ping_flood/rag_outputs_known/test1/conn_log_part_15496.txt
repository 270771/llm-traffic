Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 3, 8, and 1. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (from 13.208.10.201 to 203.78.180.105 and 203.78.182.19), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (3 and 1) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 1 (host unreachable) messages may indicate normal network error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 13.208.10.201 is generating unusual ICMP traffic volume over a longer time window.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
