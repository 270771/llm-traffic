Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 157.17.250.33, 219.102.89.134) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.229.78.71.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting persistent offending IPs.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet acting as sources.
- If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack traffic before it reaches the network.
