Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic or at least 10 such instances, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood or other specific attack heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.
- Correlate with other anomaly sources or heuristics once available to identify suspicious patterns.
