Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 1 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) suggest normal error messages rather than flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Collect more detailed heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any unusual volume or patterns in ICMP error messages if they persist.
