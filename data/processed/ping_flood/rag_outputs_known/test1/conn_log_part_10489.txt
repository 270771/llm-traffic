Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is triggered here: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from the same source targeting multiple destinations.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 54.183.69.91
  - Destination IPs: Multiple in the 163.252.x.x range (e.g., 163.252.24.217, 163.252.38.250, 163.252.235.189, etc.)
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the ping flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
