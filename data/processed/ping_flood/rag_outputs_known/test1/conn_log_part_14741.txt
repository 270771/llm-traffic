Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8, and each appears only once from different source IPs to the same destination IP.
- The third entry is ICMP type 1 (echo reply or destination unreachable), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP echo requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP are observed, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential low-rate or slow ping floods.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly records or heuristic contexts.
