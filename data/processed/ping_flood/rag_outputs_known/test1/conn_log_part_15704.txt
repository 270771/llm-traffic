Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from different source IPs targeting a single destination strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests indicating potential flooding) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.177.247, 133.228.57.203, 133.228.73.206, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used, no ports applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.228.0.0/16 if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate upstream network devices and logs for further attack vectors or compromised hosts.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
