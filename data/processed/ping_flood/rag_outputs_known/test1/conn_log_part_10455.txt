Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.98.102, 157.17.105.10, 157.17.236.44, etc.) targeting destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 44.61.16.153.
- Notify network operations to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious regions.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
