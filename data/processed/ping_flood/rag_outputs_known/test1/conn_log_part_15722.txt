Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, but there are only 6 instances targeting the same destination IP (52.236.221.123), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP type 0 packet and one ICMP type 11 packet do not form a pattern consistent with flooding or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring ICMP traffic volume and source diversity to detect any escalation toward flooding behavior.
