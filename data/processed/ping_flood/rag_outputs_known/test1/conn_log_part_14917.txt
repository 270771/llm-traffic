Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and only one ICMP echo request is logged.

No other attack patterns are evident from the single connection record. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs, this traffic does not meet the threshold for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 139.179.133.57 to the destination 203.78.173.194. If multiple such packets appear rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, gather anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
