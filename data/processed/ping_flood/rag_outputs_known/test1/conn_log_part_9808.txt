Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time window, indicating a volumetric ICMP flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard ping flood detection heuristics, this pattern matches heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.29.235, 133.247.243.54, 133.247.95.167, etc.)
  - Destinations: 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to specifically detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
5. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
6. Update incident response playbooks to include rapid detection and mitigation of ICMP flood attacks based on this pattern.
