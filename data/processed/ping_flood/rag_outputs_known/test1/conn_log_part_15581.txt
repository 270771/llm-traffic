Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89 within a very short time window. This matches the known pattern of a ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x and 203.78.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 16.160.152.89. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.160.152.89.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
