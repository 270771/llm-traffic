Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.116.11.97 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.150.176, 133.247.76.188, 133.247.92.44, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 3.116.11.97 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in similar ICMP flooding.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation or blackholing.
