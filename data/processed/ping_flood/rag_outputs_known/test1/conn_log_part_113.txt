Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (3.30.218.60) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type present, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) and the multiplicity of unique sources targeting one destination strongly indicate a distributed ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ping floods) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.161.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.30.218.60.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs at the firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host (3.30.218.60) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Deploy or update DoS mitigation tools and consider engaging upstream providers for traffic filtering support.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
