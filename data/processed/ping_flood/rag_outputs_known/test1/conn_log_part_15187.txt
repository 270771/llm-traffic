Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.109.38, 133.247.252.125, 133.247.111.23, etc.) targeting destination 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation and consider blackholing traffic from the offending sources if the attack persists. Additionally, alert network operations and conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
