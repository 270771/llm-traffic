Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) is not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests over time or checking other logs for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
