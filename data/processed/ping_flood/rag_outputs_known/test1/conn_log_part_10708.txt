Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the IP 34.25.86.31 from multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.224.163, 157.17.131.62, 157.17.9.186, 157.17.68.42, 157.17.224.70, 157.17.22.193, 157.17.113.63, 157.17.238.51, 157.17.22.196, 157.17.238.190, 157.17.157.17, 157.17.238.60).
- The pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination IP strongly matches a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood".

Involved IPs and ports:
- Target IP: 34.25.86.31 (destination)
- Source IPs: Multiple, primarily in the 157.17.x.x range and 69.47.68.36 sending ICMP type 8 packets.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.25.86.31.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood activity and identify if the source IPs are spoofed.
- If possible, apply geo-blocking or source IP blocking for the identified attacking IP ranges.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume increases.
- Review and harden the target hostâ€™s ICMP handling policies to reduce impact.
