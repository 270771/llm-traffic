Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type 8 (echo request) from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.97, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP record. Further investigation should focus on monitoring for repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods.
