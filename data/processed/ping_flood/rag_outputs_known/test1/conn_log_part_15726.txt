Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded message. This could be normal network behavior or a traceroute-related packet.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 packets increase abnormally, which might indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
