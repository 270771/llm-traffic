Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-frequency ICMP echo requests from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.148.62, 163.252.246.229, 203.78.171.216, 133.251.127.234, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation on the destination IPs and prepare to implement further mitigation such as blackholing or upstream filtering if the attack volume increases.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
