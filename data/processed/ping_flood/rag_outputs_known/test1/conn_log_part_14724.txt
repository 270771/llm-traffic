Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code 11 in the Zeek log (field 17 = 112 corresponds to ICMP type/code, but the exact type is not 8). There is only one instance of ICMP traffic, and it is not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, nor any anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious behavior.

No attack is present here. The traffic corresponds to ICMP error messages (likely Time Exceeded), which are normal in network operations.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, if further investigation is desired, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP within a short time frame would be the next step to detect potential ping floods.
