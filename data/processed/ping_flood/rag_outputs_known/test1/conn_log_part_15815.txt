Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet do not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks.  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic but with no packet count indicating multiple Echo Requests.  
- The second entry shows a single ICMP packet (count=1) with no indication of type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or behavior matching heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic volume and pattern do not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to confirm a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP type fields and packet counts over a longer time window.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection that records ICMP type codes explicitly.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
