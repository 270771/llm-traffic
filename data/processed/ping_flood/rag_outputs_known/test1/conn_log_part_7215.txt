Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 50.239.214.145. The ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume of these requests from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is heuristic 20, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, as ping floods aim to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Destination IP: 50.239.214.145 (target of the flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.229.165, 157.17.12.190, 157.17.161.144, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 50.239.214.145.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued abnormal ICMP activity and prepare to escalate to incident response if service degradation occurs.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
