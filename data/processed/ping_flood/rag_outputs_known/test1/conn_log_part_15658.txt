Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, but there are only 5 distinct instances targeting the same destination IP (35.169.51.96) and a few others scattered. The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- Other ICMP types (3 and 0) are present but do not indicate ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and replies.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs or targeting the same destination IPs.
- Investigate if any of the source IPs have a history of suspicious activity.
- Collect more data to confirm if a threshold of 10+ ICMP type 8 packets is reached or if heuristic 20 conditions emerge.
