Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target. The ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks, specifically ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.248.19, 157.17.168.29, 157.17.248.10, etc.)
- Destination IP: 44.61.16.153
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
3. Monitor the target host 44.61.16.153 for performance degradation or service disruption.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of similar traffic.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled according to organizational policy.
