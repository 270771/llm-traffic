Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type present, which is consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records are found, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range. Additionally, monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Alert network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet.
