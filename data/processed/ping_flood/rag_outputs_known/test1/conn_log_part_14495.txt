Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The entries show ICMP traffic but do not confirm type 8.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to suggest such a condition.  
- The anomaly CSV contains no records indicating suspicious IPs or ports related to these connections.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect detailed ICMP type information in logs to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
