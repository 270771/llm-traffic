Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099662.6). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (often heuristic 20 in many frameworks), characterized by multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one victim.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.28.210, 133.247.1.23, 133.247.158.204, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.193.126.151.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Deploy or tune Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
