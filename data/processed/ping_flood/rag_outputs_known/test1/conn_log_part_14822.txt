Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.37.79.118, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.110.177, 133.247.28.164, 133.247.110.20, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.37.79.118 on ICMP port 0.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these sources are compromised hosts part of a botnet. Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering traffic. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare to apply host-based firewall rules or temporarily disable ICMP responses if necessary.
