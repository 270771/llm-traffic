Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (4th column) shows values 11 and 8. Only type 8 corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- There are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) indicates other ICMP activity but not a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in high volume.
