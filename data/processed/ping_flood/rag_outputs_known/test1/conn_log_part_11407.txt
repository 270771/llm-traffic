Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from two source IPs: 3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 3.122.197.179, 54.183.76.138
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 163.252.x.x subnet
- Ports are not applicable here as ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138).
2. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in blocking or mitigating traffic from these sources.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flooding and expand filtering rules if additional sources appear.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial of service impact.
5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests automatically.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.

This targeted and immediate response will help mitigate the ongoing ping flood attack and protect network availability.
