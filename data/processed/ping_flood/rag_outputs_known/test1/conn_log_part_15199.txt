Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none, so the threshold for ping flood detection is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable detailed ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to detect potential ICMP floods.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to identify possible ping flood attempts.
