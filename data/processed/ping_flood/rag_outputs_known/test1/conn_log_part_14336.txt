Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP echo request traffic from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include 163.252.14.174, 163.252.238.115, 163.252.41.104, 163.252.140.91, and many others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching this attack.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or mitigate traffic if the attack volume escalates.
