Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.42.116.124 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; Destination IPs include 163.252.127.1, 163.252.240.7, 163.252.239.58, 163.252.5.196, 163.252.212.34, 163.252.27.76, 163.252.231.65, 163.252.147.60, 163.252.10.245, 163.252.10.201, 163.252.236.71, 163.252.240.22, 163.252.7.213, 163.252.24.231, 163.252.247.181, 163.252.242.221.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
