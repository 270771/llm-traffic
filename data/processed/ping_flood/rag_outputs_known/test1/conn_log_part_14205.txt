Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) targeting the IP 18.36.162.241 from a large number of distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.247.145.201, 133.247.145.177, 133.247.181.59, etc.). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets directed at the same destination within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8 (echo request), which is the required type for a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests flooding a target) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x and 68.104.x.x ranges are flooding the destination IP 18.36.162.241 with ICMP echo requests. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 18.36.162.241 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood filters or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 18.36.162.241.
