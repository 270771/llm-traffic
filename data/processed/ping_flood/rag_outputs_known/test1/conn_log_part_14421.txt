Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 52.158.11.176 to 163.252.181.130, and there is only 1 instance of this type.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 packets may warrant investigation into network reachability or misconfigurations but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP attacks.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages to ensure network stability.
