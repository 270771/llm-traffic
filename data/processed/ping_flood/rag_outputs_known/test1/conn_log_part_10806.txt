Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances targeting one host.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.0.0/16 range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.183.65.24. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 to 35.183.65.24.
  2. Monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or participation in a botnet.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
