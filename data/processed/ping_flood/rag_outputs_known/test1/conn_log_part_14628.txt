Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single destination IP, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.22.62, 157.17.106.49, 157.17.14.132, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 161.67.57.135.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for broader attack context.
