Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and fewer than 10 instances of any ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
