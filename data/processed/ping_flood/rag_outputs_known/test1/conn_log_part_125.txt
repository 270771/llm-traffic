Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; Destination IPs include 163.21.223.31, 163.21.213.13, 203.65.114.249, and multiple others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automatically detect and respond to similar attacks.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
