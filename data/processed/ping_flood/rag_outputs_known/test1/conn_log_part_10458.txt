Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- There are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances of such, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood or other specific attack heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type and count to identify if ping floods occur later.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any alerts related to ICMP or other DoS attack patterns.
