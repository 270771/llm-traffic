Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.235.180, 157.17.107.31, 157.17.102.23, etc.) targeting destination 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type and destination IP indicate coordinated flooding.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Conduct source IP reputation checks and consider upstream filtering or contacting ISP for mitigation.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
- Review and harden ICMP handling policies to prevent similar volumetric attacks.
