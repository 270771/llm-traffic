Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.9, and it appears only once.  
- The other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to override this.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data indicate suspicious activity related to these IPs.
