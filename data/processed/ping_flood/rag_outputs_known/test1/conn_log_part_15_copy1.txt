Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.30.218.60, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all entries, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of source IPs (all different 133.240.x.x addresses) sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP within a very short timestamp window strongly indicate a coordinated flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.240.215.232, 133.240.31.166, 133.240.23.65, etc.)
- Destination IP: 3.30.218.60
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 3.30.218.60 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Engage network operations to trace back and possibly coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Prepare incident response to handle potential collateral impacts and ensure availability of critical services.
