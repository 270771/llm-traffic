Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but there is only 1 instance of type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type 11 is a Time Exceeded message, unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is evident from the data, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and types is recommended to detect any escalation.
