Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. The types present are 3, 0, and 13, which correspond to Destination Unreachable, Echo Reply, and Timestamp, respectively.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none at all.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed are normal control message types and do not match typical flood or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate if the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 or 13 messages are related to network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
