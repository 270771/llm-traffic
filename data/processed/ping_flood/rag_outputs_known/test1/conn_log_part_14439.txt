Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 5 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 5 (Redirect) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or DoS activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged with heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.  
- Collect more detailed heuristic and taxonomy context to improve detection accuracy.
