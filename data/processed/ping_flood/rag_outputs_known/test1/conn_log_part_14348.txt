Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard detection logic, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts receiving the flood.
  3. Conduct a threat intelligence query on 13.242.241.56 to assess if it is a known malicious actor.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential upstream compromise or botnet involvement.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected network devices.
