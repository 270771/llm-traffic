Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.8.91.205 from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.113.51, 133.240.204.124, 133.240.202.20, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.8.91.205. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 69.8.91.205 for service degradation and consider temporarily isolating it from the network if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering or takedown.
