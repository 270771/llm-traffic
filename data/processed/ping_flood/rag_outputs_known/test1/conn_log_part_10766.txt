Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (44.53.133.97) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.53.133.97; Destination IPs include 163.252.249.235, 163.252.249.56, 163.252.21.198, 163.252.143.181, 163.252.212.57, 163.252.180.73, 163.252.143.249, 163.252.40.184, 163.252.40.185, 163.252.249.177.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 44.53.133.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures to prevent recurrence.
