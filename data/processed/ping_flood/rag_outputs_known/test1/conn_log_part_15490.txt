Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, which are normal ICMP control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP errors or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Collect and analyze additional logs or anomaly data to detect other potential threats.
