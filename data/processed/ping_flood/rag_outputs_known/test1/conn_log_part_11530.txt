Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in the IDS/IPS.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  5. Notify network operations and consider upstream provider filtering if attack volume escalates.
