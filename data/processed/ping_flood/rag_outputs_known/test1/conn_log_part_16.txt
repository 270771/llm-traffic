Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.79.249 to multiple destination IPs within the 133.141.197.x subnet, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.79.249; Destination IPs range from 133.141.197.228 through 133.141.197.249.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 129.43.79.249 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination subnet 133.141.197.0/24 and alert network operations.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected network owners and consider blackholing traffic if attack persists.
