Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume (more than 10 instances) meets the threshold for a ping flood detection.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.247.118.1, 133.247.56.193, 133.247.46.223, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood thresholds and anomaly-based IDS signatures.
