Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets; the ICMP type field is missing or unspecified, and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies, this traffic does not match ping flood or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Collect more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs to verify if repeated ICMP Echo Requests occur. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs, and correlate with anomaly detection systems once heuristic context is available.
