Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 13 corresponds to Timestamp requests, which are not typically associated with flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs 133.247.7.19 and 133.247.55.181 for unusual behavior or other anomaly indicators.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
