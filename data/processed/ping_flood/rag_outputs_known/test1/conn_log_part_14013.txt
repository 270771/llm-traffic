Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the IP 34.25.86.31 from multiple source IPs in a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs include multiple sources such as 157.17.3.63, 157.17.203.71, 157.17.96.189, 68.104.133.69, and others targeting destination IP 34.25.86.31 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the targeted host 34.25.86.31 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to assist with upstream filtering.
