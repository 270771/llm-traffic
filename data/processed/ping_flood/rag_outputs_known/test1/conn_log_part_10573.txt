Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a distributed ping flood or ICMP flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source without known exceptions.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 35.183.65.24
  - Destination IPs: Multiple in the 163.252.x.x range
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from this source if the attack persists.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the Zeek logs and standard detection heuristics.
