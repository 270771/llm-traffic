Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 34.33.149.154, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 133.228.x.x ranges, all targeting destination IP 34.33.149.154 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor the target IP 34.33.149.154 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if the attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
