Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.249.88.154) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.88.154; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.249.88.154 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP flooding.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic is large-scale to assist in upstream filtering.
