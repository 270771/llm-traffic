Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All provided Zeek conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious ICMP activity or known anomalous IPs related to ping floods.
- Without ICMP traffic, the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or heuristic 20 matches) cannot be met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known anomaly indicators once heuristic context is available.
