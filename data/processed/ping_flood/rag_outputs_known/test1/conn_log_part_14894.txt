Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entries present have ICMP types 128 and 11 (fields 4 and 10 in the snippet), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 128 (likely an Echo Reply), and the second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), so no Echo Requests are logged.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this threshold.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly sources to identify suspicious ICMP behavior.  
- Verifying if the ICMP traffic volume or patterns change over time.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
