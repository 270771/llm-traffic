Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal or external hosts receiving the ICMP flood.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack at a higher network level.
