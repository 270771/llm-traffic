Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood in absence of known anomalous IPs.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no source or destination ports (ICMP protocol).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (52.236.221.123) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network forensics to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Alert the incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
