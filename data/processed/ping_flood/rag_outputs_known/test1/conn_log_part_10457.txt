Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type that is not explicitly type 8 (echo request), and only one instance is present. The log field for ICMP type is missing or indicated as "-", so it cannot be confirmed as type 8. Additionally, the count of ICMP type 8 packets is far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection record. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for additional ICMP traffic, specifically echo requests (type 8), and check for repeated or high-frequency ICMP packets from or to the involved IPs (202.194.17.61 and 162.150.2.39). Further data collection and anomaly detection are needed to confirm or rule out ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
