Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (50.239.214.145) from multiple source IPs in a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 133.228.*.* IPs and 52.230.228.52 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 50.239.214.145. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target IP (50.239.214.145) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
  4. Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
