Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP, indicating a distributed flood rather than a single host, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods:
  - Heuristic 20 typically relates to known anomalous IPs, which are not present here.
  - The taxonomy class is best assigned as "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs:
  - Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.251.241, 157.17.238.76, 157.17.7.232, etc.)
  - Destination IP: 52.236.221.123
  - Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the port fields are 0 or irrelevant.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the distributed sources.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
