Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from the same source IP 3.89.103.26 to different destinations (203.78.171.216 and 203.78.181.209).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 instances is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect possible denial-of-service symptoms.
