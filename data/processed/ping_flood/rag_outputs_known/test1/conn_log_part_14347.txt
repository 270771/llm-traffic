Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 13.242.241.56
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.252.253.193, 163.252.150.37, 163.252.48.1, 163.252.44.78, 163.252.44.62, 163.252.45.157, 163.252.164.203, 163.252.131.189, 163.252.19.6, 163.252.83.27, 163.252.139.83, 163.252.139.53, 163.252.9.104, 163.252.35.6, 163.252.248.68, 163.252.52.248, etc.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify network operations and affected parties about the potential denial-of-service impact.
4. Investigate upstream to identify if this source IP is part of a botnet or compromised host.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
6. Document the incident and update firewall rules to prevent recurrence.
