Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.244.114, 163.252.16.2, 163.252.13.9, 163.252.58.193, 163.252.134.193, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is part of a botnet or compromised host.
5. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
