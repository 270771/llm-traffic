Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the required type for ping floods.
- Multiple unique source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP, indicating a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.249.209, 133.247.180.158, 133.247.249.251, etc.) targeting destination 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
