Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), matching the known ping flood pattern of multiple rapid ICMP echo requests.
- All ICMP types in these entries are 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- The source IP 163.171.168.73 is sending numerous ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood or scanning behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.239.229, 163.252.72.1, 163.252.14.221, 133.251.127.252, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misconfiguration.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the attack volume escalates.
