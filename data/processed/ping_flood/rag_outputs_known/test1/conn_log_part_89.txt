Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8 to indicate an echo request (ping). In the snippet, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641791074.966608), which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- The majority of ICMP entries have type 3 (destination unreachable) or type 11 (time exceeded), which are not indicative of ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic pattern suggests normal ICMP error and control messages rather than a volumetric ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 and 11 messages often relate to network diagnostics or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222, which appears frequently sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, to ensure it is not misconfigured or involved in other suspicious activity.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
