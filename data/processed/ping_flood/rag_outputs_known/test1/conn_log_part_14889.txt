Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and only one ICMP echo request is logged, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection log entry. Without additional data or anomalies, no further investigation into ping flood or related ICMP attacks is warranted at this time.
