Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating primarily from source IP 143.224.94.6 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 133.26.144.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the general heuristic that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 indicate a ping flood unless known exceptions apply. Here, the volume and distribution strongly suggest malicious flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.94.6; Destination IPs range from 133.26.144.42 through 133.26.144.63. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Assigning heuristic number 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels based on standard ping flood detection taxonomy.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 143.224.94.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flooding attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 143.224.94.6 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
