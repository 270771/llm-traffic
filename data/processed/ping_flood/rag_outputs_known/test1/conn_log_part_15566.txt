Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts appear normal or incomplete (mostly S0 states indicating connection attempts without completion), which could be routine scanning or benign traffic.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging and anomaly detection.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once heuristic context is available.
