Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags multiple ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.20.58, 163.252.20.57, 163.252.212.57, 163.252.252.234, and many others as listed.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify affected parties (owners of destination IPs) to prepare for potential service degradation.

This is a clear case of an ongoing ICMP ping flood attack.
