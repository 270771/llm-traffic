Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the Echo Request used in ping floods, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 61.1.51.193) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to 16.160.152.89. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.160.152.89.
  2. Investigate and potentially block the identified source IPs at firewall or IDS/IPS.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service disruption and consider deploying anti-DoS mitigation services.
