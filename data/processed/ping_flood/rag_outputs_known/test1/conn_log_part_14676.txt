Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 8 and 0, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present per source IP.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 0 entry corresponds to an echo reply, which is normal in ping exchanges.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect potential emerging ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
