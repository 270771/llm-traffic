Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.23.202.254 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, the hallmark of ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.150.35, 157.17.158.161, 157.17.2.198, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.23.202.254 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the firewall for ICMP echo requests targeting 54.23.202.254.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs in the 157.17.0.0/16 range exhibiting this behavior.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
