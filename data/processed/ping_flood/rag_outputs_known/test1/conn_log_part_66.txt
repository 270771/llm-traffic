Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from IP 133.16.14.149 to many different destination IPs within a very short time window. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of a single source IP sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destinations is a classic ping flood behavior aimed at overwhelming network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and fits the taxonomy class of ICMP-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP: Source IP 133.16.14.149; Destination IPs include 23.209.11.5, 23.79.34.0, 198.76.129.7, 69.214.138.101, 60.83.213.247, 130.90.1.145, 23.65.51.252, 23.71.168.4, 184.206.185.9, 2.209.216.252, 23.179.215.0, 23.230.134.4, 23.70.187.253, 23.241.65.253, 104.101.151.2, 104.115.54.4.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical and consistently 8 for these entries.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from other sources.
- Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misconfiguration causing the flood.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to detect and prevent future ping flood attacks.
- Notify network operations and security teams to prepare for potential collateral impact on network performance.
