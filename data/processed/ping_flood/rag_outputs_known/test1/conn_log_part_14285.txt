Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping). However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs or towards the same destination IPs. Collect more data to see if the count of ICMP type 8 packets rises above the threshold or if anomalies appear in future logs.
