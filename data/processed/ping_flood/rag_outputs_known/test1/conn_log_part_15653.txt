Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 35.169.51.96 within a very short time window. This matches the classic pattern of a ping flood, where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types involved in these connections are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP message types.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.165.153, 157.17.175.183, 157.17.27.210, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.169.51.96 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.169.51.96.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation or outage and consider applying host-based firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
