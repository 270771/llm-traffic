Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (ICMP code 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request"), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP timestamp request. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
