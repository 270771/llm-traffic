Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating primarily from IP 52.158.11.176 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range within a very short time window (~0.008 seconds each). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods:
  - Heuristic 20 typically relates to known anomalous IPs, which are not present here.
  - The taxonomy class is best assigned as "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source: 52.158.11.176 (primary attacker)
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in 163.252.x.x subnet (victims)
  - ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
  - Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the conn.log shows ICMP protocol.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 52.158.11.176 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for similar ICMP floods from other sources.
  3. Implement ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts and network devices to mitigate impact.
  4. Conduct a threat intelligence check on 52.158.11.176 to determine if it is a known malicious actor.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
  6. Review and update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and prevent similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
