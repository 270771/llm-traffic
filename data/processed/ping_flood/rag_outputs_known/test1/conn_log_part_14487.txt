Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries, none with type 8, and no repeated instances from the same source to the same destination indicating flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests or known suspicious IPs.
