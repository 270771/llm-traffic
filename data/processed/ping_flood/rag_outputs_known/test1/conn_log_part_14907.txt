Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the log snippet are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (139.179.133.57 â†’ 203.78.173.106), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) may suggest normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
