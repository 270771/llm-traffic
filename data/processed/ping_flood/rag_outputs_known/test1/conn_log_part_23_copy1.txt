Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.239.183.175 from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range flooding the destination IP 54.239.183.175. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the target host 54.239.183.175 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and take appropriate remediation.
