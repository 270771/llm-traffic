Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 16, 8, and 10. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (second log line), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (16 and 10) do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not part of a ping flood pattern.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests beyond the threshold.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems if available.
