Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (4th column) in the conn.log entries shows values 3 and 11, none of which is 8 (Echo Request). Since ICMP type 8 is required for ping flood detection, these entries do not match ping flood traffic.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood but may relate to network issues or traceroute-like activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs 133.247.153.194, 172.16.166.242, and 133.228.62.233 for unusual ICMP error message patterns or network misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Obtain or enable heuristic and anomaly context to improve detection accuracy.
