Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 110.220.22.222 to destination 203.78.187.167, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of a ping flood.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are present to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over a longer time window or checking for other suspicious patterns in related logs.
