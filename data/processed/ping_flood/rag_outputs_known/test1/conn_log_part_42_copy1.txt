Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (echo request) is from `157.161.40.85` to `18.133.254.216` with a single instance.  
- All other ICMP entries have type 0 or unspecified (0 or missing), which are not echo requests and thus not ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets overall, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet from `157.161.40.85` if it recurs or increases in frequency.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
