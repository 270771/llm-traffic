Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 157.17.111.62 and 157.17.63.180 to 35.169.51.96), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 1 (Echo Reply), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests and replies.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or heuristic matches.  
- Correlate with other logs or network behavior to detect potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.
