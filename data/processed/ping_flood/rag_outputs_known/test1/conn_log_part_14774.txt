Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 0, 8, and other numbers, but the majority of entries do not have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) consistently or in sufficient quantity.
- Only two entries have ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.
- The traffic does not exhibit the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern emerges.
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic if new anomaly data or heuristics become available.
