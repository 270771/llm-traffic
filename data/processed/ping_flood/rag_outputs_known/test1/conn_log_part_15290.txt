Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically related to network diagnostics or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.124.53.30 and 202.194.17.63) for any unusual behavior or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance.
