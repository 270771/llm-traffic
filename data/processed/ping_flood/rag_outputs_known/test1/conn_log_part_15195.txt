Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious ICMP traffic or known anomalous IPs related to ping floods.
- All connections show TCP flags and ports typical of connection attempts or scans, not ICMP flooding.

Since no ICMP traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present. The heuristic and taxonomy context for ping floods (ICMP type 8 with at least 10 instances or heuristic 20 for known anomalous IPs) cannot be applied here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any hidden ICMP flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP error messages.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS alerts for ICMP anomalies.
