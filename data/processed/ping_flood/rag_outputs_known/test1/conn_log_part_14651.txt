Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 within a very short time window (all timestamps nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.200.205, 157.17.151.10, 157.17.104.227, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 52.237.221.62 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
