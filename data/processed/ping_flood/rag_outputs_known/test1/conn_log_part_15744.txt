Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 4 times in the snippet (lines with ICMP type 8: 133.247.137.138 → 3.22.191.77, 133.247.137.149 → 3.22.191.77, 157.17.234.185 → 185.54.215.191, 133.247.79.75 → 3.22.191.77).  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here (no anomaly data found).  
- Other ICMP types are present but do not indicate ping flood (e.g., type 3, 11, 13, 45).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest a different attack type.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs have suspicious behavior elsewhere.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
