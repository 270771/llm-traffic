Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not specified as 8 (echo request), and only one occurrence is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or additional suspicious activity, this traffic does not match ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attack patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (202.194.17.61) to the destination (110.188.237.204). If multiple echo requests accumulate rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
