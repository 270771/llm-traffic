Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from several source IPs (e.g., 133.16.14.149, 157.78.78.187, 157.78.69.33, 35.73.37.202) targeting multiple destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs include sources: 133.16.14.149, 157.78.78.187, 157.78.69.33, 35.73.37.202; destinations include: 54.141.128.22, 52.191.37.124, 35.133.158.83, 163.210.183.6, among others. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and consider upstream provider filtering.
  4. Alert network operations and potentially isolate affected hosts to prevent collateral impact.
  5. Review and update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
