Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from IPs 54.212.218.127 and 52.17.245.190 targeting 203.65.103.15, with just two instances present. This is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 and others have ICMP type 0 or 3, not type 8, which does not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise or to identify known suspicious IPs that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially from single sources targeting one destination.  
- Investigate the two IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets (54.212.218.127 and 52.17.245.190) for unusual behavior or repeated requests.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
