Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present in the log snippet are 11, 8, 8, and 3. Only type 8 corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 58.193.7.117 and 133.228.62.234 for unusual ICMP activity if volume increases.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ping floods.
