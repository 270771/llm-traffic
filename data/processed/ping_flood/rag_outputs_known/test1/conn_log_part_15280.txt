Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.130.188.37) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to various targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous ICMP echo request floods) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.130.188.37; Destination IPs include 203.78.186.195, 203.78.178.104, 203.78.184.33, 203.78.148.101, 203.78.148.105, 203.78.178.242, 203.78.170.82, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.171.214, 203.78.179.90, 203.78.184.1, 203.78.184.183, 203.78.187.176.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.130.188.37 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or compromised hosts.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
