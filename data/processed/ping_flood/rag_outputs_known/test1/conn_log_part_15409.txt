Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show only 1 instance each of ICMP traffic, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The ICMP type is not explicitly listed, but given the low count and no anomaly data, there is no evidence of repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect and analyze more extended logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged with heuristic 20 or similar once data is available.
