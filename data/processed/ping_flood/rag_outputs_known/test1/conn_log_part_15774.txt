Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal network control messages rather than attack indicators.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP requests from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 or 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
