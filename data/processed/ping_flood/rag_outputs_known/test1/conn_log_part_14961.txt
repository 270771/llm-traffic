Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.250), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or additional anomaly data, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if either IP is flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based anomalies.
