Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.101.165.68 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic that a ping flood involves at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting a victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.19.40, 133.247.19.126, 133.247.43.193, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.101.165.68 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the victim host (18.101.165.68) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
