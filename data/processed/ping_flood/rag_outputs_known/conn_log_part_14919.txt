Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11, 11, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 11 and 13 correspond to Time Exceeded and Timestamp, respectively, which are not typical of flooding attacks.

Next steps:
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 packets to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in source/destination IPs.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
