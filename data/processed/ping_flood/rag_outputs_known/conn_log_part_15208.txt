Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) counts toward ping flood detection.  
- There is only 1 instance with ICMP type 8 (from 61.89.3.1 to 163.252.134.144). The other entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 message could be normal network behavior (e.g., unreachable host).

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 61.89.3.1 or destination 163.252.134.144 appear in future anomaly reports or show repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ping flood activity.
