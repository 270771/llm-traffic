Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time window (~1 second). This volume and pattern of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances without known exceptions.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.50.133, 133.247.182.41, 133.247.50.190, etc.) targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the victim IP.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation or outages on 157.187.159.183.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
