Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.50, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the data, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and types is recommended to detect any future anomalies.
