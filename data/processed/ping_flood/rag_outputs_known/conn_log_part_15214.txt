Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.186.116.19) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-frequency ICMP echo requests from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.186.116.19; Destination IPs include 163.252.67.91, 163.252.45.103, 163.252.84.10, 163.252.40.150, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.186.116.19 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching this attack.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host and potentially trace back to the attacker.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
