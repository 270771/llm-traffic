Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to identify if ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) increase beyond the threshold.
- Monitor source IPs for heuristic 20 matches to catch ping flood attempts early.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10), which involve TCP SYN floods, not ICMP floods.
