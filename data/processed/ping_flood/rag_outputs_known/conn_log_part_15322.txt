Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if either IP address is repeatedly sending or receiving unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Collect more detailed logs or anomaly data to apply heuristics if available.
