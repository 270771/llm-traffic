Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (fields 4 and 6), none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only single instances per source IP, no repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without ICMP type 8 packets or multiple repeated pings, this traffic does not match ping flood or similar ICMP-based DoS patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate if additional logs show ICMP type 8 packets or repeated pings.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.
- Correlate with other network logs or IDS alerts for potential anomalies.
