Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are source IP 54.183.76.138 and multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, all using ICMP protocol with type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other hosts targeted by similar ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider engaging upstream ISP to filter or trace the source if attack persists.
