Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.177.247, 133.228.82.124, 133.228.213.4, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Alert the network operations team to monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
- If possible, coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
