Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and destination IP 52.237.221.62. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62 at the network perimeter firewall. Conduct traffic filtering to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets. Investigate source IPs for potential blacklisting or upstream blocking. Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature for ICMP flood detection.
