Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (11) correspond to Time Exceeded messages, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may warrant investigation into possible traceroute activity or network issues but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns over time.  
- Investigate the source IPs 203.78.179.25 and 14.98.70.219 for unusual behavior if ICMP traffic volume increases.
