Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP packets have type 8 (echo request), which matches ping traffic, but there are only 7 instancesâ€”fewer than the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests from these or other sources. Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if the volume or pattern changes to meet ping flood criteria. Investigate the source IPs if they continue to send ICMP traffic at a high rate.
