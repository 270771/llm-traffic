Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.98 and from 13.74.134.236 to 202.194.32.93). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 traffic may warrant routine network troubleshooting but does not indicate an attack per the given criteria.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or patterns matching heuristic 20 if such context becomes available.
