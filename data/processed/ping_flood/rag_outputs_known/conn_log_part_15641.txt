Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source.
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.205.57, 163.252.3.158, 163.252.139.113, and many others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic originating from 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 16.172.102.121 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact on affected destination IPs.
