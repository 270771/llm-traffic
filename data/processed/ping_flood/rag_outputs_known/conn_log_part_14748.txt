Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 11 and 8. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (echo request), and the total count of ICMP type 8 instances is less than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) indicates other ICMP activity but not a ping flood.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a traceroute or other benign activity.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to refine detection.
