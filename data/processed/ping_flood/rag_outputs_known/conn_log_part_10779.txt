Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.47.69.34 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from diverse source IPs targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.65.158, 133.247.105.207, 133.247.127.182, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 69.47.69.34. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 69.47.69.34.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify the affected system owner and coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic is volumetric and external mitigation is required.
