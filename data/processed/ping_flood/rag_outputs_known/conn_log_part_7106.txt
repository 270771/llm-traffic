Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.230.228.52, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter for ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.230.228.52. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 packets. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation escalation such as blackholing or upstream filtering if the attack persists.
