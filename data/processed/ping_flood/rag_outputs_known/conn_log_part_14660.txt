Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be multiple hosts sending ICMP echo requests to a single destination IP (52.237.221.62), which could be normal network scanning or monitoring activity rather than flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without additional anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume from these or other sources to the same destination IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs have suspicious behavior elsewhere.  
- Investigate the purpose of these ICMP requests to 52.237.221.62 to rule out benign network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
