Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.215.122.104, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources sending ICMP type 8 packets) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 3.215.122.104. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor the target host 3.215.122.104 for service degradation and consider isolating it if the attack persists.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
  5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering attack traffic closer to the source.
