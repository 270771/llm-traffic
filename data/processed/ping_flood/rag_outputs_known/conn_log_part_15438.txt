Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.184.243.206 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the instruction referencing known anomalous IPs and ping flood detection), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.81.244, 133.247.67.61, 133.247.149.106, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.184.243.206 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.184.243.206.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare incident response for potential service disruption.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
