Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood (heuristic 20).
- The heuristics present (10, 12, 999) correspond to SYN attack, FIN attack, and an unspecified anomaly, none of which indicate ping flood activity.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to destination IPs.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP flood patterns.
- Continue to monitor anomalies with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and 12 (FIN attack) as they indicate other types of network attacks.

No ping flood is detected; the heuristics 10 and 12 stand for SYN and FIN attacks respectively, which are different TCP-based attack types.
