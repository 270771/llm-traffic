Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not specified as 8 (echo request), and only one packet is present. There are no multiple ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) to indicate a flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or related anomalies, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple such packets appear (â‰¥10), re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
