Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present in multiple entries, but the total count of such instances is fewer than 10 (only about 10 entries, some with type 0 or 8 mixed).
- There is no evidence of a single source IP sending a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP, which is typical for ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and replies scattered across different source IPs and destinations, not concentrated or repetitive enough to indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency from single sources.
- Investigate if any of the IPs (e.g., 157.17.139.254, 52.237.221.62) show unusual behavior over time.
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
