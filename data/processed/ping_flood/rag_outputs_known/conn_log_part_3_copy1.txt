Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood); instead, they show heuristic 999 (other) and heuristic 10 (SYN attack).  
- The heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the many TCP SYN (S0) flags seen in the logs, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, but not ICMP ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 107.81.9.228 and its repeated TCP connections on port 23 (Telnet), as flagged by anomaly_96 with heuristic 999 (other suspicious traffic).  
- Investigate the SYN attack heuristic 10 anomaly related to destination IP 163.21.148.140 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect ping floods specifically.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.  
- Heuristic 999 indicates other suspicious traffic not fitting known categories.  

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on TCP SYN anomalies and suspicious Telnet traffic for further investigation.
