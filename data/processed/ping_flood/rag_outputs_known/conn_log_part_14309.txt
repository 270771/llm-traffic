Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet. The ICMP entries have no type specified, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is less than 10 (only 2 entries total).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic does not match the pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination, which is typical for ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) connection state and low packet counts suggest isolated ICMP packets rather than a flood or scan.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing more extended logs to check for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Enable detailed ICMP type logging to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in source/destination IP behavior.
