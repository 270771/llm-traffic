Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is at timestamp 1641791074.966608 from 15.146.150.124 to 203.65.103.15, and there is only one such instance.
- The majority of ICMP traffic from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8.
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, but no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic could be normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP error message patterns, as it is generating multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to better classify ICMP traffic patterns.
