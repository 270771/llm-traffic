Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP type 11 packets from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network path issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
