Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with ping requests.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly datasets.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate against the ping flood criteria and heuristics.
