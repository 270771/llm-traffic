Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from source IP 139.179.133.57 to two different destination IPs (203.78.173.75 and 203.78.173.76). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present are 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 traffic may warrant routine network troubleshooting but does not indicate an attack per the given criteria.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP type 8 packets in high volume.
