Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance of each ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated anomalies from these IPs is recommended as a next step.
