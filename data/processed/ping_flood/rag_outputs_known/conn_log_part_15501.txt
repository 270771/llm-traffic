Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 130.197.147.183 to 16.160.194.189). The other entries are ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) could be normal network behavior or related to traceroute-like activity, which is not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in high volume over time.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
