Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be type 8 (Echo Request). In the provided logs, only a few entries have ICMP type 8, and none show at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 from the same source or to the same destination IP.  
- The entries with ICMP type 8 are sparse and do not indicate a high volume or flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold for detection.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 11) are present but do not correspond to ping flood behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP activity without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious behavior.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) or other ICMP types if they increase significantly, as they may indicate other network issues or attacks.
