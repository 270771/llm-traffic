Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.119.5.36) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.119.5.36; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.119.5.36 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Engage incident response to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
