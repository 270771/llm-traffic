Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present (from 203.78.177.156 to 208.31.9.44). The other entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant for ping floods.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, but no heuristic or anomaly data is available here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports are flagged.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request and a single ICMP Destination Unreachable message does not constitute an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if heuristic 20 or other heuristics become relevant once anomaly data is available.  
- Continue logging and correlating with other network events to detect emerging patterns.
