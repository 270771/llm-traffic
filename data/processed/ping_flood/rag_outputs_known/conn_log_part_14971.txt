Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.242).  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests, as it could be a precursor to a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
