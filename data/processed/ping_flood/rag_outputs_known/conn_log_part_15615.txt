Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 3, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to identify possible reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
