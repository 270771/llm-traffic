Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP without known exceptions. This matches heuristic 20 (common in ping flood detection taxonomies).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack" under ICMP flood category.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.229.78.71. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.229.78.71.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block the attacking source IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare mitigation such as blackholing or scrubbing services.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with ICMP flood detection and automatic blocking capabilities.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
