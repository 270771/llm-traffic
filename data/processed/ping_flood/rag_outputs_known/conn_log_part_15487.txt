Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV record references a suspicious connection unrelated to ICMP or ping floods and is categorized under heuristic 999 with taxonomy 'mptmp', which does not correspond to ping flood heuristics.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic or at least 10 such instances, the conditions for detecting a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp' likely refer to a multi-port or multi-target scanning anomaly, which should be investigated separately.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP traffic specifically, filtering for type 8 packets.
- Investigate the suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42:46280 for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect future ping flood attempts.
