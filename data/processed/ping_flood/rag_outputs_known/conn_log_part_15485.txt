Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from source IP 13.215.8.84 to destination 133.102.30.93, and there is only 1 such instance in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 2, 3, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The ICMP types 2, 3, and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, and other control messages, which may indicate network issues but not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential ping floods early.  
- Investigate the source IP 13.215.8.84 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to correlate with heuristic rules once available.
