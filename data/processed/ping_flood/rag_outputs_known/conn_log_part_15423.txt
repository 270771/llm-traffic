Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are `1` (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), not `8` (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving known suspicious IPs or increased ICMP echo requests.
