Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs all sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP 18.34.27.210 within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts overwhelm a target with echo requests.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, satisfying the requirement for ping flood detection.
- The number of instances (24 entries) exceeds the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.
- No known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present in the anomaly CSV; the only anomaly listed (anomaly_1472) involves a different IP and heuristic 999 unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/ DDoS" as the most likely labels based on standard ping flood heuristics.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.17.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.17.163.1, 157.17.221.242, 157.17.9.65, etc.)
- Destination IP: 18.34.27.210
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; type 8 indicates Echo Request.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 18.34.27.210.
2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source if possible.
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
