Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Requests from any source IPs.  
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.
