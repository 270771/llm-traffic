Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this fits heuristic 20: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host," and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.118.251, 133.247.117.88, 133.247.180.78, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for performance degradation and consider isolating it if service impact is detected.
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
5. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
