Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times in the snippet (from IP 35.183.65.24 to various destinations).  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- Other ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), which does not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 packets may warrant routine network troubleshooting but does not constitute an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.183.65.24 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests at higher volumes.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics if available.
