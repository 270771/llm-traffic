Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only one ICMP connection entry (timestamp 1641099717.373290) with ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is the correct type for ping.
- However, there is only a single instance of ICMP type 8 traffic recorded, far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.
- No other ICMP type 8 entries or repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination are present.
- No source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies are found in the anomaly CSV or logs.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to TCP traffic on port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks.
- The only anomaly found is heuristic 10 (SYN attack), which relates to TCP SYN flood or connection attempts, not ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the single ICMP echo request for normal network diagnostics or benign activity.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic frequency or volume to detect emerging ping flood attempts.
- Review TCP SYN anomalies (heuristic 10) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity, as indicated by the anomaly on 89.3.89.164:8080.

No ping flood attack is currently detected.
