Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11 and 8, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present (line with src IP 203.78.177.156). The other entries are ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which do not indicate ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 11 traffic may be related to traceroute or network issues but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
