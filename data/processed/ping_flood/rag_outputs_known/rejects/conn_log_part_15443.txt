Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.161.126.169, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from different source IPs to a single destination IP strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous src/dst IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources including 157.17.162.68, 157.17.168.26, 157.17.61.60, 157.17.169.183, 130.197.147.255, 157.17.102.95, 157.17.75.70, 157.17.234.185 targeting destination 16.161.126.169. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host 16.161.126.169 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled to prevent future floods.
