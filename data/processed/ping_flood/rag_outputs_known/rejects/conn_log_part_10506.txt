Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records.
- The anomalies present (heuristic 10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and unknown/miscellaneous anomalies, not ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic.
- Heuristic 999 is a catch-all for unknown or miscellaneous anomalies.
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or ping flood patterns is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Verify if any ICMP logs exist outside this snippet to rule out ping flood attempts.
