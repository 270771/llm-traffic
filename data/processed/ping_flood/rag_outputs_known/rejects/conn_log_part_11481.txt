Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is consistent with ping requests.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without additional anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Correlate with broader network logs to detect if these IPs appear in other suspicious activities.  
- Obtain or define heuristic context to better classify borderline or low-volume ICMP anomalies.
