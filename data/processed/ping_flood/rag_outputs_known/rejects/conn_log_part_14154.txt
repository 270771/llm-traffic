Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present (from 114.37.72.18 to 163.252.92.106), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may warrant investigation into possible traceroute or network path issues but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 114.37.72.18 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
