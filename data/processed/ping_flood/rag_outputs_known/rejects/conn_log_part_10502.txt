Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 11 and 3 (from the 7th field in the Zeek log entries), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages, which could indicate misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
