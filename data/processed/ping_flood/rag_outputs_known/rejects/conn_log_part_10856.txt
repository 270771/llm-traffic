Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating primarily from IP 52.250.47.198 targeting multiple destination IPs within the 203.78.x.x range. There are at least 8 distinct entries from this source within a very short time frame, indicating rapid repeated ICMP echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10 in this snippet, the concentration and rapid succession strongly suggest ongoing ping flood activity. The presence of multiple distinct destination IPs targeted by the same source IP further supports this.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard detection heuristics for ping floods, this matches heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.250.47.198; Destination IPs include 203.78.184.211, 203.78.180.90, 203.78.180.118, 203.78.184.95, 203.78.184.35, 203.78.186.38.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 (echo request) is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.250.47.198 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential impact on network availability.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or enabling existing DoS protection features on network devices.
