Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 1 (ICMP type field is 3rd from the right in Zeek conn.log, here it is 1), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP type 1 packet. ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," which is a normal network response and not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP errors or other anomalies.
