Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and other unknown anomalies, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 20 specifically requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs flagged for ping flood, neither of which is present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The anomalies relate to TCP SYN floods (heuristic 10) and unknown anomalies (heuristic 999), which should be investigated separately.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP traffic explicitly, especially ICMP type 8 packets.
- Correlate with ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect potential ping floods.
- Investigate the SYN flood anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 for possible TCP SYN flood attack.
