Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating a SYN flood or similar TCP-based attack, not ICMP-based.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets to overwhelm a target.  
- The anomaly taxonomy class for heuristic 10 is "ptmp" (partial TCP message pattern), indicating suspicious TCP connection attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further for potential SYN flood activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Ensure ICMP logging is enabled and properly captured to detect ICMP-based attacks.
