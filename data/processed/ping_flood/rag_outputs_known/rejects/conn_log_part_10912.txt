Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for ping flood detection, but no ICMP records appear in the snippet.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), both unrelated to ICMP ping floods.  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the TCP SYN flags seen in the logs (S0 state).  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Confirm if other logs (e.g., icmp.log) contain relevant ICMP traffic for further analysis.
