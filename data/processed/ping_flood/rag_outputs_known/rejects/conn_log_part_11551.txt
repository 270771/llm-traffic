Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and 12 (FIN attack), both TCP-based.  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the anomalies related to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and 12 (FIN attack), as these indicate potential TCP-based scanning or DoS attempts.  
- Specifically, review source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 (anomaly_782) for SYN flood activity and source IP 193.193.157.140 for FIN-based anomalies.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture potential future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
