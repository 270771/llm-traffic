Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The first entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 133.247.237.137 to 212.200.144.252, which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not count toward a ping flood.
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 203.78.177.156 to 95.169.140.6, but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports.
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ICMP-based attacks.
