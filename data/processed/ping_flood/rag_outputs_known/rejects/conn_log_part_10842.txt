Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 7 distinct ICMP type 8 entries from source IP 3.78.5.55 targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~8 seconds), indicating rapid repeated ping requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the concentration of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations strongly suggests a ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard detection logic, this matches heuristic 20 (rapid ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.78.5.55 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 203.78.174.82, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.174.114, 203.78.170.52, and 203.78.173.218.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.78.5.55 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources of ICMP floods.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
