Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they only mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), which relate to TCP anomalies.
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping floods, but it is not present in the anomalies.
- The traffic mostly shows SYN scans or failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), consistent with SYN attack patterns (heuristic 10).

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further, as heuristic 10 indicates SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high ICMP echo request rates outside this snippet.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN scans or floods.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on TCP SYN anomalies for further investigation.
