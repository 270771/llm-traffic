Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (16.160.194.189) in a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although the count is just under 10, the rapid succession and multiple unique sources targeting the same destination strongly indicate a ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are explicitly provided, but by standard practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from 130.197.x.x subnet targeting 16.160.194.189 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the firewall for ICMP echo requests targeting 16.160.194.189.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with upstream providers to identify and mitigate the source IPs.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations to prepare for potential service degradation and plan for traffic filtering or blackholing if the attack escalates.
