Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present in the snippet (first entry: src IP 52.239.198.82 to dst IP 202.100.171.198).  
- The other ICMP entries are of types 3, 0, and 13, which are not Echo Requests (type 8).  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) packets is normal network behavior and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
