Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type values of 8 and 0 in the source and destination port fields, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as 8 in the snippet. The Zeek conn.log format shows ICMP type in the "id.orig_p" field for ICMP traffic, which here are 8 and 0 respectively. Only one record has ICMP type 8 (source port 8), the other is 0.  
- There are only 2 ICMP records total, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Investigate the source IP 69.47.69.34 and 203.78.177.156 for any unusual behavior in other logs.
