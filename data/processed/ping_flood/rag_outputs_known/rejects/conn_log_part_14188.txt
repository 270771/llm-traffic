Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; they only mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter).
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping flood attacks, which are absent here.
- The traffic mostly consists of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, not ICMP-based flooding.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further for possible SYN flood or scanning activity, as indicated by heuristic 10 (SYN attack) in anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012.
- Monitor source IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74 for suspicious TCP SYN traffic.
- Consider deploying SYN flood mitigation techniques such as SYN cookies or rate limiting on suspicious ports.
- Collect ICMP traffic logs to confirm or rule out any ICMP-based attacks in the future.
