Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 3, and 11, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the minimum threshold of 10 instances of ICMP type 8 is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate if any new anomaly records appear related to these IPs.
- Collect heuristic context to better classify future anomalies.
