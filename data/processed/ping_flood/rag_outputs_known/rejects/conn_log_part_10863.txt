Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only two ICMP entries with types 3 and 8.  
- Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The ICMP type 3 entry is a destination unreachable message, not related to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or additional anomalies, this traffic does not match ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if either IP (202.124.53.30 or 133.247.49.34) appears in future anomaly reports or matches known threat intelligence.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or bursts of ICMP echo requests.
