Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), so the traffic is ICMP ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomalies or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of flooding emerges.  
- Investigate the source IPs (54.249.10.152) for reputation and past behavior to rule out reconnaissance or scanning activity.
