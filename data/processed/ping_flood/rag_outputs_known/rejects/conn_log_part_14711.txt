Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 13.86.188.134 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target. No other ICMP types are involved, confirming the traffic is specifically echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here. The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions), which relates to known anomalous source or destination IPs involved in ping floods. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Destination IP: 13.86.188.134 (target of the ping flood)  
- Source IPs: Multiple (133.247.184.87, 133.247.243.54, 133.247.196.17, 133.247.196.58, 133.247.105.156, 133.247.249.209, 133.247.165.254, 133.247.73.145)  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable (ICMP type 8)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor the target host (13.86.188.134) for performance degradation or service disruption.  
4. Engage with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and apply network segmentation or firewall rules accordingly.
