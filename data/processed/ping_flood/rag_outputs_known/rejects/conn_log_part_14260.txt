Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries, both with types other than 8, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not signify flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, especially repeated Echo Requests from the same source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP type 8 with high frequency to rule out ping flood attempts.
