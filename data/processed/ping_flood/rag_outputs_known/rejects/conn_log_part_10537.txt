Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections, mostly SYN packets (S0 state), targeting port 80 or 443, with no ICMP traffic present.
- There are no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets visible, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic pattern suggests a possible TCP SYN scan or connection attempt flood, but this is not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic context, the best classification is a potential reconnaissance or SYN flood attempt, which typically falls under heuristic 10 (TCP SYN flood) and taxonomy class "DoS" or "Reconnaissance."

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets from source IP 111.158.97.185 to multiple destination IPs on port 80 for possible SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further confirmation of attack type.
