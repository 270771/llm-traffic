Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the data to suggest another attack type. Since no heuristic context or anomaly records are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) for possible flooding behavior.
