Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (54.249.88.154) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short time frame. There are at least 7 distinct entries with ICMP type 8, close to the threshold of 10, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches the known heuristic that a ping flood involves repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.88.154; Destination IPs include 163.252.44.75, 163.252.44.248, 163.252.38.250, 163.252.75.57, 163.252.44.202, 163.252.38.42, and 163.252.38.248. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.88.154 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or targeted by the flood.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
