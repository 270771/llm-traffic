Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; all listed heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) or 999 (heavy hitter).
- Heuristic 20 specifically indicates ping flood attacks, which are absent here.
- The traffic mostly shows SYN scans or connection attempts (S0 TCP flag), consistent with SYN attack heuristics (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter anomalies.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further, as indicated by heuristic 10, which points to potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high volumes of SYN packets or connection failures to mitigate SYN flood risks.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN-based scanning or attacks (heuristic 10, taxonomy 'ptmp').
