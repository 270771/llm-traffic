Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance in the snippet is from timestamp 1641099619.603903 with src IP 131.176.159.112 to dst IP 147.224.224.35, and only one such record is present.  
- The other ICMP record has type 0 (not 8), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 131.176.159.112 or destination 147.224.224.35 have any prior suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential reconnaissance or low-rate ICMP scanning.
