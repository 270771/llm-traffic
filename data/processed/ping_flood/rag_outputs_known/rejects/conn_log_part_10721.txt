Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries do not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or alternative heuristics apply.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without ICMP type 8 or volume, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if more extensive logs show repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Enable detailed ICMP type logging to capture and analyze ICMP message types explicitly.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known suspicious IPs if anomaly data becomes available.
