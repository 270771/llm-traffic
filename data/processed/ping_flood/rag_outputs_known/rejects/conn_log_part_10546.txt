Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 203.78.176.250 to 52.221.129.114, but there is only 1 instance recorded.
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any new anomalies appear related to these IPs.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
