Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests rather than other ICMP types.
- The destination IPs 54.178.233.150 and 69.47.68.36 are repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs, indicating a coordinated flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding destination IPs 54.178.233.150 and 69.47.68.36 with ICMP Echo Requests on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP range that may be participating in the flood.
- Engage incident response to trace back the origin and potentially coordinate with upstream providers to mitigate the attack.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS mitigation services.
