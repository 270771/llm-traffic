Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which corresponds to a SYN flood or TCP SYN scan, not a ping flood.  
- Heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets, consistent with the TCP connection attempts seen in the logs.  
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or anomalies matching heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by analyzing connection attempts from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Ensure ICMP traffic logging is enabled and reviewed regularly to catch ping floods early.
