Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  
- ICMP type 3 typically indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," which are normal ICMP message types and not indicative of flooding.  

No known heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here due to lack of anomaly data.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or repeated ICMP type 3 or 10 messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
