Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic present has types 0 and 8, but the ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (from 133.247.54.178 to 54.186.100.117).  
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply) from 203.78.177.156 to 45.229.87.6, which is not a ping flood indicator.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious IPs or behavior.  
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source flooding a destination, this does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or if heuristic 20 (if defined later) applies.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
