Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 52.181.47.160 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed source pattern typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and 69.47.68.36 targeting destination IP 52.181.47.160 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.181.47.160.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.228.0.0/16 and 69.47.68.36) if they are not legitimate.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers for possible mitigation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
