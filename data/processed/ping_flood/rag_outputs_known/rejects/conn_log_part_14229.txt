Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 messages often indicate network issues or scanning but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood attempts.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
