Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is logged here.  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP entries are present.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different source IP (89.3.89.164) and port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, which involves TCP SYN flood attempts, not ICMP ping floods.  
- The taxonomy class 'ptmp' in the anomaly CSV relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing TCP SYN packet rates and connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood activity, as current data lacks ICMP records.
