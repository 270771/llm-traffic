Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one occurrence, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is evident from this single ICMP type 3 entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other anomalous traffic patterns involving these IPs, but currently, no ping flood or related attack is detected.
