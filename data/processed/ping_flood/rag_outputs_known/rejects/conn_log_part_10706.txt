Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets targeting the single destination IP 34.25.86.31 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets directed at 34.25.86.31, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting volumetric ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.200.205, 157.17.114.195, 157.17.18.152, 157.17.18.137, 157.17.213.220, 157.17.200.202, 157.17.179.247, 157.17.179.31, 157.17.54.134, 157.17.110.190; destination IP: 34.25.86.31; ICMP type: 8 (echo request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 34.25.86.31 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
