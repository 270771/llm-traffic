Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- The anomaly record references a suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42 but does not indicate ICMP type 8 traffic or a known ping flood heuristic. The heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp' do not correspond to ping flood detection criteria.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The anomaly flagged is unrelated to ICMP echo requests and likely pertains to a different suspicious activity type.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the anomaly_1442 flagged connection for potential other threats, focusing on the destination IP 45.136.197.42 and the port mentioned.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect possible ping floods.  
- Clarify heuristic definitions to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
