Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or sustained ICMP traffic is evident.

No other attack type is indicated by this single isolated ICMP packet. Without multiple repeated echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign or normal network activity.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 202.202.88.224 to destination 161.67.220.144. If the count rises above 10 or anomalies appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
