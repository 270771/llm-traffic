Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and checking for increased volume or repeated echo requests from suspicious IPs. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no specific taxonomy or heuristic can be assigned.
