Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The observed ICMP traffic is likely benign or related to network diagnostics (e.g., traceroute).

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies is recommended.
