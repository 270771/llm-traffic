Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 1 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 (Destination Unreachable - Port Unreachable) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 1 and 3 messages correlate with any network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
