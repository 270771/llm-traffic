Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing issues.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
