Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but none explicitly indicate ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The protocol field in all entries is either TCP (6) or UDP (17); no ICMP (1) entries are present.
- No repeated ICMP type 8 packets or counts reaching the threshold of 10 instances are visible.
- The anomaly record references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood, but no anomalies or traffic matching this heuristic are found.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP traffic logs are available to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN flood attacks, which matches the anomaly found but is unrelated to ping floods.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete TCP handshakes, consistent with SYN attacks, not ICMP floods.
