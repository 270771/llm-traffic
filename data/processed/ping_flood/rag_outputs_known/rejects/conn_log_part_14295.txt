Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 13 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting two destination IPs: 69.46.227.121 and 52.175.248.229.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from multiple sources targeting the same destination.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions), which relates to known anomalous IPs involved in ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: 130.197.25.104, 130.197.147.249, 130.197.21.30, 130.197.61.122, 130.197.61.124, 157.17.254.17, 130.197.140.80, 130.197.62.249, 130.197.157.155, 157.17.66.30, 130.197.139.53, 157.17.17.66, 157.17.254.3
- Destinations: 69.46.227.121, 52.175.248.229
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate internal hosts.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
