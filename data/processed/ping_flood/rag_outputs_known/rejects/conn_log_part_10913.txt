Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

**Reasoning:**
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP packets are logged.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters on TCP ports, not ICMP ping floods.

**Heuristic and Taxonomy Explanation:**
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 is a custom or undefined heavy hitter classification.
- No heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies are detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as multiple TCP SYN connection attempts with flag S0 (SYN sent, no response) are present, indicating possible SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs.

No ping flood attack is currently detected based on the provided data.
