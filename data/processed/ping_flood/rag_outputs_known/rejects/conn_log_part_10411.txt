Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other anomaly reports or threat intelligence feeds.
