Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances (in fact, none).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP unreachable messages, which are normal network behavior or error reporting.

Next steps:
- Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in a broader dataset to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
