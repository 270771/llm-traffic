Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (code 11 in ICMP is Time Exceeded or other control messages, not type 8 which is Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the ping flood criteria. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but is not sufficient evidence of an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies if they appear.
