Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows only two entries with ICMP type 8 (echo request), from IPs 133.228.201.228 and 133.228.201.239 to 13.241.236.109. This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, and 11, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- No other attack patterns are evident from the data.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and insufficient evidence of attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 13.241.236.109 is experiencing any service degradation or unusual traffic patterns.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
