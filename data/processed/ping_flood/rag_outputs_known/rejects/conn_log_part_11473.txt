Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 133.228.172.225 to 52.181.17.215 and from 130.197.60.23 to 173.97.102.148), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3 and 13) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity once anomaly data or heuristics become available.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
