Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one ICMP packet with type 8 (echo request) is present in the snippet (from 133.247.237.137 to 197.239.164.191).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 11, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
