Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related anomalies; the heuristics present are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), none of which correspond to heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly relates to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets, absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalous source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating possible SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Review network logs for ICMP traffic separately to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs to detect emerging ping flood attempts.
