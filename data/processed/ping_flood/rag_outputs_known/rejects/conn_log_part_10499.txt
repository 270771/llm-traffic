Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 47.92.212.151 to destination 133.102.179.201, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or related to other issues but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from the same source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies if they appear in future logs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
