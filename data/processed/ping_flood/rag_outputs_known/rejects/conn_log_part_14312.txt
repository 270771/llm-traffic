Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the same source IP 3.89.103.26 targeting multiple destination IPs. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.89.103.26; Destination IPs include 203.78.170.126, 203.78.186.195, 203.78.171.209, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.186.54, 203.78.170.82, 203.78.181.10, 203.78.187.173.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.89.103.26 at the network perimeter firewall to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and servers for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS systems.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to prevent further malicious traffic.
