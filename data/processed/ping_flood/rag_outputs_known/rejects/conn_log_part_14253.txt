Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related heuristics; they show anomalies related to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), neither of which indicate ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further, as it indicates potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Validate if any hosts are generating excessive SYN packets or exhibiting scanning behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP connection attempts with SYN flags.  
- The taxonomy class 'ptmp' (point-to-multipoint) suggests scanning or connection attempts to multiple hosts or ports.

No evidence supports a ping flood attack at this time.
