Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is a single instance: from 171.113.188.62 to 133.102.29.68. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are types 1, 3, and 13, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) packets may be normal network behavior or unrelated anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 171.113.188.62 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious behavior.
