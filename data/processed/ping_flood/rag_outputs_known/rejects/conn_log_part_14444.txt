Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (54.250.161.90) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short time frame. There are at least 8 distinct entries with ICMP type 8, and several have very low response times, indicating rapid repeated pings consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the volume and rapid succession strongly suggest a ping flood, especially since no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override the threshold.
- Since no anomaly CSV or heuristic context is available, assign heuristic number 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, which is the standard classification for ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.250.161.90; Destination IPs include 203.78.187.177, 203.78.179.67, 203.78.190.198, 203.78.185.184, 203.78.185.118, 203.78.187.152, 203.78.186.53.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.250.161.90 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are similarly targeted or involved.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
