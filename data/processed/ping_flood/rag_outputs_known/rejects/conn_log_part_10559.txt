Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the anomaly CSV to suggest otherwise. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or TTL expiration, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood but normal network diagnostic or routing behavior.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or multiple anomalous IPs per heuristic 20 (if available) is recommended for future detection.
