Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries targeting the same destination IP 54.16.160.215 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although the count is just under 10, the volume and concentration of ICMP echo requests from diverse sources strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs range from 130.197.139.41 to 130.197.190.246; Destination IP is 54.16.160.215; ICMP type 8 (echo request) is the relevant port/type.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.16.160.215.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential escalation.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential extended DoS mitigation.
  5. Consider deploying an upstream DDoS mitigation service if traffic volume increases.
