Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.47.68.36) from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to suspicious src/dst IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.178.137, 133.247.165.151, 133.247.153.69, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.47.68.36 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (69.47.68.36) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to block or mitigate traffic from the attacking IPs if possible.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the target system for any collateral impact or compromise.
