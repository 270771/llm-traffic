Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 11, 1, 13, and 129, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., type 11 = Time Exceeded, type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 13 = Timestamp Request, type 129 = ICMPv6 Echo Reply), which do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual ICMP activity or other protocol anomalies.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify any anomalies if they arise.
