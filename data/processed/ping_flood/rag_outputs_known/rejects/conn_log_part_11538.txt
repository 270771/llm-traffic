Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 203.78.177.156 to 104.195.202.57). The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not available here.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) could relate to traceroute or routing issues, which is not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
