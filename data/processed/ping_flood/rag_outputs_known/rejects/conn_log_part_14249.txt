Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present (10 and 12) correspond to SYN and FIN attacks, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).  
- Heuristic 12 corresponds to FIN attacks (TCP FIN flood).  
- Both are different from heuristic 20, which is specific to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN and FIN anomalies further, as they may indicate TCP-based flooding or scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
