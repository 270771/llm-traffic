Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the two relevant entries from source IP 52.181.47.160 is type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 157.17.58.249) is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they appear repeatedly or correlate with other suspicious activity.
