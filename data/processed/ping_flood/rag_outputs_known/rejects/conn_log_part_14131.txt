Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP connections, none with ICMP type 8, and no repeated instances from the same source to the same destination.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, these entries likely represent normal network diagnostic traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information if possible.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.
