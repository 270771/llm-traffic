Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related anomalies; the heuristics present are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other suspicious activity), none of which correspond to heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- The heuristic 20 specifically relates to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets from or to suspicious IPs, none of which are evident here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) related to IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74, as these may indicate a SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any other protocols or ports show abnormal behavior consistent with the anomalies labeled as 'ptmp' or 'heavy_hitter'.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN-based attacks (heuristic 10) and other suspicious TCP traffic, not ICMP ping floods.
