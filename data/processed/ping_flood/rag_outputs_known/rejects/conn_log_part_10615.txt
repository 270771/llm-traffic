Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 133.247.146.52 to 173.235.215.96), which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP echo request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
