Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded) or type 3 (Destination Unreachable), none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (3 and 11) typically relate to network diagnostics or routing issues, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential misconfigurations or network issues.  
- Monitor for any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible ping floods.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies if they arise.
