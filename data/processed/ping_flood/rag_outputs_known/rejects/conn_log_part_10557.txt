Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 and 1, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and none are present here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 1 and 3 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Echo Reply or other control messages, which do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 1 messages for potential misconfigurations or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies if they arise.
