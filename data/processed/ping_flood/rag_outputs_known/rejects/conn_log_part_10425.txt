Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP ping flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.59.66, 133.247.130.27, 133.247.134.52, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.178.233.150.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential escalation if the attack persists or escalates.
