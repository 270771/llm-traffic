Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other anomalies unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Therefore, no evidence supports a ping flood attack.

Other observations:
- The anomaly with heuristic 10 corresponds to a SYN attack (TCP SYN flood), indicated by anomalous SYN flags on suspicious ports.
- The anomaly with heuristic 999 is uncategorized but unrelated to ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by reviewing TCP SYN packet rates and source IP behavior.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if any firewall or IDS rules are triggered by these SYN anomalies to prevent escalation.
