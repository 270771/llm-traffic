Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) to indicate flooding. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Since ICMP type 3 is present, this could indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. Investigate if multiple ICMP error messages (type 3) are symptomatic of network misconfiguration or other scanning activity.
