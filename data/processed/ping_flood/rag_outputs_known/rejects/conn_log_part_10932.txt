Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10 instances) to be considered an attack, this single ICMP type 3 entry does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context to suggest otherwise. The ICMP type 3 typically indicates error messages rather than flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns involving these IPs.
