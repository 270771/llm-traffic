Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting the single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range flooding the destination 54.178.233.150. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.178.233.150.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  3. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems to alert on and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
