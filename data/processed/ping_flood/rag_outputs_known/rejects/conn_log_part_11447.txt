Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 20 specifically requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs flagged for ping flood, neither of which appear here.

No other attack type matching ping flood is evident. The anomalies relate to TCP SYN floods or suspicious port usage, but not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the TCP SYN anomalies further (heuristic 10) as they may indicate SYN flood attempts.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic explicitly to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Ensure ICMP logging is enabled and verify if any ICMP traffic is filtered or missing from logs.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 stands for Ping flood detection based on ICMP type 8 packet counts.
- Current anomalies fall under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other heavy hitters), unrelated to ping floods.
