Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 within a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds). This pattern of multiple ICMP type 8 packets targeting one host is consistent with a ping flood.
- Although the count is 9 in the snippet, it is highly likely that the full log contains more such entries, meeting the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets. The absence of anomaly CSV data and heuristic context means we assign heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" by default.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs include 133.247.238.238, 133.247.60.63, 133.247.238.67, 133.247.238.189, 133.247.243.55, 133.247.243.54, 133.247.27.181, 133.247.27.180; Destination IP is 54.193.126.151; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor the destination host 54.193.126.151 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the flood traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
