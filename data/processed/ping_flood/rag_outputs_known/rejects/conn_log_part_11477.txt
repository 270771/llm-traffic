Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry shows zero instances (count 0), and the other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious activity in broader network logs.
