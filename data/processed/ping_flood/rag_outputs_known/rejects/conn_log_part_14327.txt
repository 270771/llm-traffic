Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows predominantly TCP and UDP traffic; only one ICMP record is present (timestamp 1641099718.501029) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single instance is logged.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) is triggered by known anomalous IPs. No such multiple ICMP echo requests or heuristic 20 anomalies are present.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- All other traffic is TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) or UDP on port 1900 (likely SSDP), none matching ICMP ping flood patterns.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, not ICMP ping floods.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN attack behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly from 89.3.89.164:8080 further, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning attempt.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Verify if any other hosts show repeated ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.

No ping flood attack is currently detected.
