Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is logged here.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which corresponds to suspicious TCP SYN traffic, not ICMP.
- Heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not triggered or referenced in the anomalies.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets possibly related to scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- The anomaly taxonomy class 'ptmp' is assigned to this SYN anomaly, indicating partial or temporary suspicious connections.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN anomalies further, especially from IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, to determine if a SYN flood or scanning activity is ongoing.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to detect any potential ping flood attacks, as none are visible in this snippet.
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets and count their frequency to apply heuristic 20 if needed.
