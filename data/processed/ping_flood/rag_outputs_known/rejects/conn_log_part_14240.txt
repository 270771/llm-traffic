Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code 11 in the Zeek log (field 4 is 11), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity (ICMP type 11). Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 traffic spikes abnormally, which could indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
