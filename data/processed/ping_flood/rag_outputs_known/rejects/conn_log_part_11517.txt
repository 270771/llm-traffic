Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets, this single ICMP type 3 entry does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The observed ICMP type 3 traffic typically indicates network diagnostics or error messages, not an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages could be useful to detect network issues or other anomalies.
