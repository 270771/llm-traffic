Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.178.233.150, which matches the pattern of a ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and 44.51.211.229 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor the target host 54.178.233.150 for service degradation and consider blackholing traffic from persistent offenders. Conduct further investigation to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
