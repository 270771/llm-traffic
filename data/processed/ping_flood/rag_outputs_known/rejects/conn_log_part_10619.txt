Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and an unknown heuristic 999, neither indicating ping flood activity.  

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.  
- The anomalies here are categorized as 'ptmp' (heuristic 10, SYN attack) and 'mptmp' (heuristic 999, unknown), indicating other types of suspicious TCP traffic, not ICMP floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 for possible SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if the unknown heuristic 999 anomaly requires further classification or investigation.
