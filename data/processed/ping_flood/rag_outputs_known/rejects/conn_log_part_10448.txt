Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values other than 8, and only three entries have ICMP type 8 (echo request).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack unless anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified in the snippet.  
- The traffic does not exhibit the volume or pattern typical of a ping flood (high frequency of ICMP echo requests from a single or multiple sources targeting a victim).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify suspicious IPs or patterns.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related alerts referencing heuristic 20 if it becomes available.
