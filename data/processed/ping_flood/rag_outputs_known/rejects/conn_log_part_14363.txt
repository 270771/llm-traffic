Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries visible.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all, and no anomalous IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to identify possible ping floods.  
- Correlate with anomaly detection systems for heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics once available.
