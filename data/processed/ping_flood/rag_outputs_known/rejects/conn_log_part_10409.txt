Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 3, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are detected, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate network error or diagnostic messages, not an attack.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) to ensure network health.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
