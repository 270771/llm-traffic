Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Since ICMP type 11 is related to traceroute or TTL expiration, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate network path issues or reconnaissance. Without heuristic context or anomalies, no further attack classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if repeated ICMP type 11 messages persist, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or scanning activity.
