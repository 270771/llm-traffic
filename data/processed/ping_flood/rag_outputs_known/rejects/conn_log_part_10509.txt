Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is present (from 203.78.177.156 to 194.92.12.46).  
- The other ICMP entries are types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or correlating with other logs for suspicious activity.
