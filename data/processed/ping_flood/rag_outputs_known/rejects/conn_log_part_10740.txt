Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) typically indicate network diagnostic or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
