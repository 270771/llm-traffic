Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.29.238.156 from different source IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 6 distinct ICMP type 8 entries, close to the threshold of 10, indicating a potential ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the presence of multiple unique sources sending ICMP type 8 packets simultaneously to a single target strongly suggests a distributed ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Sources 157.17.59.231, 157.17.63.237, 157.17.12.185, 157.17.12.190, 157.17.12.61, 157.17.63.224 targeting destination 54.29.238.156 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs temporarily.
- Monitor the target host 54.29.238.156 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct further network traffic analysis to identify if additional sources are involved.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
