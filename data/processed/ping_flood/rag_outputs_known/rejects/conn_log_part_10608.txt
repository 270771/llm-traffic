Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP packets are logged here.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies.
- The anomalies present relate mostly to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and other suspicious TCP traffic, not ICMP floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs.
- The taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' relate to partial or multiple partial TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs flagged under heuristic 10 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
