Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 11, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other two entries with ICMP type 11 correspond to "Time Exceeded" messages, not echo requests, and thus are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may warrant investigation into possible traceroute or network issues but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 111.82.100.14 sending the single ICMP echo request if it recurs frequently.
