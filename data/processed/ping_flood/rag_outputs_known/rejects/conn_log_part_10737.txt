Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 8 respectively. Only the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection.  
- However, there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods and may indicate normal traceroute or routing issues.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, no further investigation is warranted specifically for ping floods. If more data becomes available, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (176.110.72.43) would be recommended.
