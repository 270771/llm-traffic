Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other anomalies unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- The anomalies found relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and an undefined heuristic 999, neither indicating ping flood activity.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic explicitly, ensuring ICMP logs are collected.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP anomalies or rate-based alerts.

No ping flood is detected at this time.
