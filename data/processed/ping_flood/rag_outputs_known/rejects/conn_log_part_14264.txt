Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance of each ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated unreachable/time exceeded messages could be a next step if network issues arise.
