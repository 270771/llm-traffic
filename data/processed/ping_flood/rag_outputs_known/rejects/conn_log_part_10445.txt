Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 128 (ICMPv6 Echo Request), but the ICMP type field in Zeek conn.log for ICMPv6 is not explicitly given here; however, the ICMP type 128 corresponds to an Echo Request in ICMPv6, which is analogous to ICMP type 8 in ICMPv4. Despite this, there is only one instance of such traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious source or destination IPs that would override the instance count rule.

No other attack patterns are evident from the single connection log entry.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to the destination IP. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for a potential ping flood. Also, consider enabling detailed ICMP type logging to better distinguish ICMPv4 vs ICMPv6 types.
