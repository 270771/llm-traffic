Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns of flooding or other anomalies.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
