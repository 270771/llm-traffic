Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times from source IP 69.47.68.48 to different destination IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 13, 1, and 3, which are not type 8 and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of a few ICMP Echo Requests is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 69.47.68.48 shows other suspicious behavior or appears in future anomaly records.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
