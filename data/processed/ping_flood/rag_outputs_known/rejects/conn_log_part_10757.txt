Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 for SYN attack, 999 for heavy hitter) relate to TCP anomalies, not ICMP.
- Therefore, no evidence supports a ping flood attack.

Other observations:
- Some anomalies correspond to SYN flood patterns (heuristic 10, taxonomy 'ptmp'), indicating possible SYN attacks.
- These should be investigated further by reviewing TCP SYN packet rates and connection attempts from IPs like 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP traffic explicitly to detect ping floods.
- Investigate the SYN anomalies for potential TCP SYN flood attacks.
- Confirm if any ICMP traffic is filtered or missing from logs to ensure full visibility.
