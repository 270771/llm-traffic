Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 3, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 in the provided conn.log snippet.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic and at least 10 instances of it, the traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume over a longer period.
- Checking for other ICMP-based anomalies or different protocols that might indicate other attack types.
