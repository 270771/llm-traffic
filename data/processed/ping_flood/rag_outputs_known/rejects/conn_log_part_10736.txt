Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values 11 and 3, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- Only one instance per source IP is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types are typical of network diagnostic or error messages, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or attacks.
