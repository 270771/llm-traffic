Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.55.10.218 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.75.115, 133.247.47.245, 133.247.153.194, etc.) flooding destination IP 34.55.10.218. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet or compromised hosts.
  3. Notify network operations to investigate and potentially block offending IPs upstream.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Review and harden the target hostâ€™s ICMP handling policies to prevent resource exhaustion.
