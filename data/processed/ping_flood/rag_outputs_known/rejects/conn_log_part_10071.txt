Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.55.10.218 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.231.187, 133.247.184.42, 133.247.149.1, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.55.10.218 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate given the volume and nature of traffic.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 34.55.10.218 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall rules accordingly.
