Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, no further investigation into ping flood is warranted.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other security systems or threat intelligence feeds.
