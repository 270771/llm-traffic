Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.129.151, 133.247.182.171, 133.247.49.57, 133.247.182.156, 133.247.180.8, 133.247.224.249, 133.247.30.65, 133.247.50.159, 133.247.49.20) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 157.187.159.183. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs.
  2. Engage upstream providers to help filter or block malicious traffic if it is volumetric.
  3. Monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of affected systems to ensure no further compromise.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
