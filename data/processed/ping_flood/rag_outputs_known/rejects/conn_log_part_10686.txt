Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or related ICMP anomalies; they only mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), which are unrelated to ping floods.  
- The heuristics context confirms heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping floods, which is not triggered here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) noted in anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012, as these indicate potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing unusual TCP connection failures or high SYN retries, which may indicate other DoS attempts.

No evidence of ping flood or ICMP-based attack is present in the current data.
