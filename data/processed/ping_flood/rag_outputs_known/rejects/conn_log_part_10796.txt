Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 6 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP 54.179.180.7 within a very short time frame, indicating a coordinated flood.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the presence of multiple unique sources targeting the same destination with ICMP type 8 strongly suggests a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard ping flood detection heuristics, this matches heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.17.54.155, 157.17.105.107, 157.17.136.120, 157.17.231.174, 157.17.151.138, 157.17.166.58; Destination - 54.179.180.7; ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader DoS activity.
