Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values 3 or 11, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances is zero, well below the threshold of 10.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages, not indicative of flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply due to lack of anomaly data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data for deeper analysis if suspicious activity arises.
