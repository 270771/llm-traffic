Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from the IP 3.78.5.55 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.78.5.55 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to destination IPs 203.78.191.246, 203.78.170.126, 203.78.191.4, 203.78.170.57, 203.78.177.192, 203.78.177.69, 203.78.191.106, 203.78.177.107.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.78.5.55 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this or other IPs.
- Investigate the source host 3.78.5.55 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider notifying affected destination IP owners if internal to your network.
