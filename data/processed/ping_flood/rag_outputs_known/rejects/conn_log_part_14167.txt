Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
