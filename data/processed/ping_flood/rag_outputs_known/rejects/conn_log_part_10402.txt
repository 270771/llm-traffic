Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.  
- The anomaly CSV shows one anomaly (anomaly_782) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as 'ptmp' with heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating a possible SYN flood or TCP SYN anomaly, not a ping flood.  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets, matching the TCP traffic seen here.  
- No heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies are present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly_782 further for potential SYN flood or TCP-based DoS activity from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible ping floods.
