Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but no ICMP traffic entries.
- The ICMP type field is not present or indicated as type 8 (Echo Request) in any record.
- The heuristic context states that ping floods require at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies are detected.
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20; the anomalies present are heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (unknown/mptmp).
- All connections are either TCP or UDP with no evidence of ICMP echo requests or floods.

No other attack type matching the current data is indicated except for heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to anomaly_782, which is unrelated to ping floods. Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, characterized by many SYN packets on suspicious ports.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 flagged under heuristic 10 for potential SYN flood activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible future ping floods.
- Enable deeper packet inspection or ICMP-specific logging to capture echo request floods if they occur.
