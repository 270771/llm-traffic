Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting two main destination IPs: 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150. This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs are involved. Here, the threshold is clearly exceeded.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions), which relates to suspicious source or destination IPs involved in flooding attacks.
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood variant.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IPs: Multiple from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.34.165, 133.247.177.198, 133.247.118.1, etc.)
  - Destination IPs: 69.47.68.36 and 54.178.233.150
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Notify network operations to monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are known to be malicious.
5. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
