Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP connections on port 1900 from 80.142.66.223 to various destination IPs, but none of the entries indicate ICMP traffic or ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- All protocol fields are either UDP (protocol number 17) or TCP (protocol number 6); no ICMP protocol (protocol number 1) entries are present.
- The heuristic context states that ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8 packets, with at least 10 instances unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) is already triggered by known anomalous IPs.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping flood (heuristic 20) are present in the anomaly CSV.
- The anomalies listed relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10), heavy hitters (heuristic 999), and other TCP-based anomalies, none matching ping flood criteria.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 1900 from 80.142.66.223, as this port is commonly associated with SSDP amplification attacks, which can be a vector for DDoS but not a ping flood.
- Review ICMP traffic logs specifically to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or heuristic 20 triggers.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds explicitly to ping flood attacks.
- Current anomalies fall under heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other heavy hitter or multi-port anomalies), unrelated to ping floods.
