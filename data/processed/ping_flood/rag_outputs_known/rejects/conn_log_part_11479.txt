Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 specifically corresponds to ping flood detection, but no such heuristic or matching anomaly is found here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic explicitly or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.

No other attack types matching the current data are evident. The SYN attack heuristic (10) noted in anomaly_772 is unrelated to ping floods and involves different IPs and ports.
