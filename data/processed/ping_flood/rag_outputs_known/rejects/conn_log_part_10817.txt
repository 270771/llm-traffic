Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two distinct connections from 54.200.201.221 to two different destination IPs, each with a count of 1. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3 and 56, which are not Echo Requests (type 8), so they do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 56 (TTL expired) messages are normal network control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 54.200.201.221 is generating unusual traffic patterns over time.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
