Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 133.247.22.9 to 18.22.151.10, and there is only one such instance.
- The other ICMP entries are type 1 or 3, which are not ping requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages may indicate normal network error reporting.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly generate ICMP errors, which could indicate misconfiguration or scanning activity.
