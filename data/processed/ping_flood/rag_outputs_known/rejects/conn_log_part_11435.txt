Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or known suspicious IPs flagged by heuristics, this traffic appears benign or isolated.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (192.178.71.64) to the destination (15.222.237.152). If volume spikes or additional anomalies appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
