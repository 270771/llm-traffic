Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 1 (ICMP type field is 1, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" or similar), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP entry. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns or anomalies.
