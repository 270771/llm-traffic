Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time frame, which strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack (ICMP echo requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target).
- Although the count is just under 10, the volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to a single destination IP is indicative of coordinated flooding.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard ping flood detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from different sources targeting one host).
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (157.17.203.71, 157.17.100.161, 157.17.50.157, 157.17.110.193, 157.17.45.253, 157.17.65.205, 157.17.212.98, 157.17.231.174) targeting destination 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 161.67.57.135.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
