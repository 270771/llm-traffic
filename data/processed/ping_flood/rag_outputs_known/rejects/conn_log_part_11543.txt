Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance of it, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets or checking other logs for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.
