Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, fewer than the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network issues or scanning but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages for potential misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
