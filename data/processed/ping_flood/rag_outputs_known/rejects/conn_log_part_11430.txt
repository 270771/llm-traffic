Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP entries present have types 11 and 12 (ICMP type 11 = Time Exceeded, type 12 = Parameter Problem), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances, and none at all in this snippet.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP traffic observed appears to be diagnostic or error-related rather than malicious flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if additional logs show ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data once available to detect emerging threats.
