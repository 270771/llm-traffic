Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 1 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP connection records, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for related anomalies.
