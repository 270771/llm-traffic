Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values present are 0, 1, 2, and 3, but none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may represent other ICMP activity such as destination unreachable (type 3) or echo reply (type 0).

No heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood is applicable here. Further investigation could focus on the nature of these ICMP messages if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, but no immediate ping flood attack is detected.
