Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and other suspicious TCP traffic, not ICMP ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).  
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to other or unknown anomalies, not ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the suspicious TCP SYN anomalies further, as multiple S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags indicate possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks not visible in this conn.log snippet.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping flood attempts.
