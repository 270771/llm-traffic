Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries at all; all records are TCP or UDP.  
- No ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are present, which is mandatory to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 (ping flood) is not triggered or referenced in any anomaly record.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets, not ICMP.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 relates to partial TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on 89.3.89.164:8080 further for potential TCP SYN flood or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm if any other logs or sensors capture ICMP traffic to rule out ping flood attempts outside this snippet.
