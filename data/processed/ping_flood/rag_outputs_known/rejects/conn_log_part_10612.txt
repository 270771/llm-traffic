Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic context states that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 must be present unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) is explicitly triggered by known anomalous IPs, which is not the case here.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks, which require ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- The current anomalies and logs do not match this heuristic or taxonomy.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for any future ping flood attempts.  
- Confirm that ICMP traffic is being captured correctly by the monitoring system.
