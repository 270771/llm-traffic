Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.178.233.150) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no source or destination ports (ICMP protocol).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.178.233.150.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  3. Enable ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response if service degradation occurs.
