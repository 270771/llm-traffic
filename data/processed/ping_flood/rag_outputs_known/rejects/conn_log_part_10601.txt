Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) entries. All logged connections are TCP or UDP, with no indication of ICMP type 8 packets.  
- The heuristic for ping flood (heuristic 20) requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.  
- The only anomaly record present (anomaly_782) relates to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as 'ptmp' under heuristic 10, which corresponds to a SYN attack, not a ping flood.  

Recommendation:  
- No ping flood attack is detected. However, the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 on IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 should be investigated further.  
- Next steps: Review connection attempts from 89.3.89.164 for SYN flood patterns, check firewall logs for repeated SYN packets, and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious traffic from this IP.
