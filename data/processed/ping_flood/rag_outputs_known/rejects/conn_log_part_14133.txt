Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the presence of ICMP traffic with code 11 (which corresponds to ICMP type 11, Time Exceeded) and code 0 (Echo Reply) is indicated by the port fields (11 and 0). Neither is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic observed appears to be normal control messages (e.g., Time Exceeded, Echo Reply), not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from any source IP.  
- Collect and analyze full ICMP type fields in future logs to confirm traffic types.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
