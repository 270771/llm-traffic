Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.173.120 to destination 54.186.100.117, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply) from 202.124.53.30 to 162.150.2.70, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential repetitive ICMP echo requests that may indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related network logs.
