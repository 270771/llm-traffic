Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances or any known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 confirms no ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (icmp.log or equivalent) to detect any ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for other types of volumetric or protocol-specific attacks using additional logs or IDS alerts.  
- Confirm if heuristic 20 or other heuristics apply once anomaly data is available.
