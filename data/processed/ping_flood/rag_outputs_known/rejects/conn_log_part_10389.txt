Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to port 8080 from source IP 89.3.89.164, which matches TCP SYN flood behavior, not ICMP ping flood.
- Heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not triggered or referenced in the anomalies.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to detect any potential ping flood attacks.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
