Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, assign heuristic number 20 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely classification.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.70.54, 163.252.242.176, 163.252.40.211, 163.252.131.237, and others as listed.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify affected network administrators of targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts.
5. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
