Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from source IP 18.76.108.217 to multiple destination IPs appear only 3 times in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The OTH (other) connection state and low packet counts suggest normal or benign ICMP traffic rather than a volumetric attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP or multiple sources targeting the same destination(s).  
- Investigate if the source IP 18.76.108.217 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more extended log data to verify if the count of ICMP type 8 packets rises above the threshold for ping flood detection.
