Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 4th column (after source IP and port). The entries show ICMP types 11, 8, and 8.
- Only two instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.
- Investigate the source IPs 139.179.133.57 and 203.78.177.156 if they repeatedly send ICMP echo requests in larger volumes.
