Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 0 and 8, but the entries with ICMP type 8 (echo request) are fewer than 10 instances. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 as the source port (52.158.11.176 â†’ 163.252.37.43), and the others have ICMP type 8 as the destination port or are mixed with type 0.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic does not show the volume or repetition pattern typical of a ping flood (which requires at least 10 ICMP echo requests from the same source or to the same destination in a short time frame).

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated echo requests from single IPs.
