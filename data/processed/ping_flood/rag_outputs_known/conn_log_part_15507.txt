Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections, but none explicitly indicate ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The only UDP entries have protocol number 17 (UDP), not ICMP (protocol 1).  
- No evidence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is present, nor are there any source or destination IPs flagged with heuristic 20 (Ping flood) in the anomaly CSV.  
- The anomalies listed relate to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters, not ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the anomalies detected on TCP ports with SYN flags.  
- The taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'heavy_hitter' relate to TCP connection anomalies, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further by reviewing connection attempts from source IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74, as these may indicate scanning or brute force attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if any firewall or IDS rules are in place to mitigate SYN flood or scanning activity.
