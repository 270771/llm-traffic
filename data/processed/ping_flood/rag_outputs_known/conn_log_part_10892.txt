Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic from 89.3.89.164, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, indicating possible TCP SYN scanning or flooding, not ICMP ping flooding.
- The taxonomy class 'ptmp' in the anomaly CSV is related to port-based anomalies, consistent with SYN attack heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 further for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Confirm if any firewall or IDS rules are triggered by the SYN anomalies and adjust mitigation accordingly.
