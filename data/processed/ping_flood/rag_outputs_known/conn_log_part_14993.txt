Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request). In the provided logs, only two entries have ICMP type 8: from source IPs 192.179.223.214 and 192.179.222.145 to destination 18.100.239.147.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 11 and 0) do not correspond to ping flood behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate if the source IPs 192.179.223.214 and 192.179.222.145 have any prior history of suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
