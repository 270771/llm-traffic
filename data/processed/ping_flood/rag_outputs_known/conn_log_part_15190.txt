Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, all within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.23.231, 133.247.167.25, 133.247.240.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate attack sources.
  3. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP traffic.
  4. Notify the affected system owners to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary ICMP blocking on the target host if feasible.
