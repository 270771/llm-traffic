Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.22.151.10) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range flooding the destination IP 18.22.151.10 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no specific ports involved (ICMP does not use ports).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (18.22.151.10) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS mitigation appliances.
