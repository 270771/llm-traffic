Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from different source IPs to a single destination IP strongly aligns with heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which relates to known anomalous source or destination IPs involved in ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.55.243, 133.247.22.46, 133.247.144.220, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.229.78.71 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
