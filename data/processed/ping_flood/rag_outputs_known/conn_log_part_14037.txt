Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs including 133.228.73.206, 133.228.9.190, 133.228.252.55, 133.228.88.23, 133.228.252.62, 133.228.196.1, 133.228.196.198, 133.228.170.6, 133.228.210.185, 133.228.184.55, 133.228.77.193, 133.228.208.3, and destination IP 68.104.133.69. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 68.104.133.69.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts among the source IPs.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
