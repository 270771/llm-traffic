Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time frame (~1 second). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting one host) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.15.251, 133.247.39.32, 133.247.127.142, etc.) all targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but source and destination ports are 0 as expected.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (157.187.159.183) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
