Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 54.206.231.130 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting one host is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all relevant entries, satisfying the condition for ping flood detection.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, meeting the threshold for attack detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic 20 matches are present in the anomaly CSV to override this conclusion.
- Since no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided, assign heuristic 1 (common ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" as the most likely classification.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Destination IP: 54.206.231.130 (target of the ping flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.17.8.105 through 157.17.99.224 (various hosts in the 157.17.x.x range)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.206.231.130.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor network and host performance metrics on 54.206.231.130 for signs of service degradation or failure.
- Prepare incident response to handle potential escalation or collateral impacts.
