Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.206.231.130 within a very short time window. This matches the known pattern of a ping flood, where multiple ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the target host 54.206.231.130 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with DoS protection.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
