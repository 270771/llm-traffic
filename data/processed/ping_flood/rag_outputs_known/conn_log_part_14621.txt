Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but there are only 5 instancesâ€”fewer than the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The lack of anomaly records and heuristic context means no taxonomy or heuristic can be assigned confidently.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets, especially if the count exceeds 10 or if additional anomaly data becomes available. Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity or if other logs show related anomalies.
