Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets directed primarily at the destination IP 34.44.165.118 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 157.17.235.178, 157.17.235.139, 157.17.60.5, 157.17.7.254, 157.17.98.70, 157.17.231.254, 157.17.60.6, 157.17.250.218, 157.17.231.212, 157.17.98.123, 157.17.235.188, 157.17.19.193, 157.17.171.173, 157.17.7.133, 157.17.250.88, 157.17.161.227 targeting destination 34.44.165.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 34.44.165.118.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs exhibiting excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to detect possible amplification or coordinated attacks.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the affected host 34.44.165.118 for service impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to automatically mitigate such floods.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
