Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- All entries are TCP or UDP, with no indication of ICMP type 8 packets.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies; they mostly indicate SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and other categories unrelated to ICMP.  
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping floods, but no such heuristic is present in the anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) such as anomaly_782, anomaly_2012, and anomaly_772, which indicate suspicious TCP SYN traffic possibly related to SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are generating excessive UDP or TCP traffic that could indicate other DoS or scanning attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- The taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on investigating SYN anomalies further.
