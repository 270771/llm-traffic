Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 192.179.222.13, 192.179.223.198) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.229.78.71.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and ensure critical services on 54.229.78.71 remain available.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
