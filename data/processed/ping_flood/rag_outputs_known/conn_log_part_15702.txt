Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present (from 61.24.197.49 to 133.251.66.163). The other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and only one ICMP type 8 packet is logged.  
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 11 could be normal network behavior or related to traceroute-like activity, not a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 61.24.197.49 or destination IP 133.251.66.163 have any prior suspicious activity in other logs.
