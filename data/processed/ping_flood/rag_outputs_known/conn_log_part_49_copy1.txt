Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8 to indicate an echo request (ping). In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 3.21.148.176 and 13.58.1.2 targeting 203.65.103.15). This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to qualify as a ping flood.  
- The majority of ICMP entries have types 3 or 11, which correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, not echo requests. These do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may suggest network scanning or routing issues but not a flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for possible misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
