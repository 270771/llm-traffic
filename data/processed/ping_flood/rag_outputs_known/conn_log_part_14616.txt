Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.114.109, 157.17.27.236, 157.17.114.118, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
  5. Conduct a deeper investigation to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for remediation.
