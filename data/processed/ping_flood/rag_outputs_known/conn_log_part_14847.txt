Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.77, and there is only 1 occurrence, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy information is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
