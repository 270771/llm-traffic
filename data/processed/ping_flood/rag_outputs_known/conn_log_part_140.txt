Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have a type field in the 4th column (after source IP and port), which is either 3 or 11, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 in the provided snippet, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic shows multiple ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded), which may indicate network issues or traceroute-like activity, but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 further for unusual ICMP activity, as it is sending many ICMP packets of types 3 and 11.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods.
- If ICMP type 3 or 11 traffic spikes abnormally, consider investigating potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data, but ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic is typically related to network diagnostics or error messages, not flooding attacks.
