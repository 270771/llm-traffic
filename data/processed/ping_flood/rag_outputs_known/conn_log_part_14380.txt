Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types correspond to "Time Exceeded" (type 11) and "Destination Unreachable" (type 3), which are normal network control messages rather than attack indicators.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate unusual ICMP error messages, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.
