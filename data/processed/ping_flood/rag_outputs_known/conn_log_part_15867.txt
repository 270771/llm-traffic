Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.228.4.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.1.117, 157.17.5.195, 157.17.157.17, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 157.17.0.0/16 to the victim IP 54.228.4.24.
- Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources if the attack volume is high.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
- Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if the attack persists or expands.
