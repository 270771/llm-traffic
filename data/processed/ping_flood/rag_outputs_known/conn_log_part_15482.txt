Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the conn.log entries show only 1 and 0 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) respectively, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count requirement.  
- The traffic volume and connection states (OTH) do not indicate a flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP echo request counts from these or other IPs.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP type fields explicitly to confirm traffic nature.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly records.
