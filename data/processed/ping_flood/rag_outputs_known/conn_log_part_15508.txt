Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- None of the ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood.
- The ICMP types present are 1, 0, 7, and others, none matching the ping flood criterion.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and in fact, none at all.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP traffic with various types but no flooding pattern.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP type 8 traffic increases or if anomalies appear in future logs.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once heuristic context is available.
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential related network issues.
