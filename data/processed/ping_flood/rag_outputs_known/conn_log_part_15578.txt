Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 11 (code 11 in the ICMP field), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if more comprehensive anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available.
