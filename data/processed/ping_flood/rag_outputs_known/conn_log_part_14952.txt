Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.209, and there is only one such instance.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to override this.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern in extended logs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
