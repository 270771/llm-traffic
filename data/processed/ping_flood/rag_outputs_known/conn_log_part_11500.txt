Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.249.88.154) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source: 54.249.88.154
  - Destinations: 163.252.9.182, 163.252.12.59, 163.252.99.211, 163.252.99.114, 163.252.99.168, 163.252.9.117, 163.252.244.122, 163.252.244.6, 163.252.244.79, 163.252.213.1, 163.252.220.5, 163.252.213.190, 163.252.213.154, 163.252.220.6, 163.252.150.91, 163.252.150.102, 163.252.150.93
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.249.88.154 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by this attack.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
