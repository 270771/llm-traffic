Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (50.239.214.145) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources) typically associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 50.239.214.145; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 50.239.214.145.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from suspicious source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact on the target host and network availability.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
