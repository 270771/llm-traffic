Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 52.236.221.123 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources of similar ICMP floods.
  4. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate mitigation.
  5. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS for early warning.
