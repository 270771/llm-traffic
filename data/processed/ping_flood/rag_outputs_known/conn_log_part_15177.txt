Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.229.78.71, which is a classic indicator of a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests; all other ICMP types present are either absent or minimal and unrelated.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range) to a single destination IP strongly match known ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 133.247.123.98, 133.247.231.178, 133.247.33.114, 133.247.26.197, etc., all targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.229.78.71.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack source.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary isolation if impact is severe.
