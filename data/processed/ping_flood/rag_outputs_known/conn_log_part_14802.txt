Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, only three entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 139.179.133.57, 223.165.122.245, and 130.197.25.147).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 instances is 3, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs that would override the count threshold.  
- Other ICMP types present (11 and 0) do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not relevant to ping floods.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy or heuristic number can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they become more frequent or if other suspicious behavior emerges.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
