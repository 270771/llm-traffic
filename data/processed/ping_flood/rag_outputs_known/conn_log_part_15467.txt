Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying ping floods. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
