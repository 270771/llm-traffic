Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10 instances) and no anomalies or heuristic matches are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single OTH (other) connection with ICMP type 3. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if multiple ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.
