Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.230.228.52 from multiple different source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send ICMP Echo Requests rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 52.230.228.52 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or botnet involvement.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP floods.
