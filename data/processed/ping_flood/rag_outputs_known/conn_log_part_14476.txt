Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 20 specifically stands for ping flood, which is absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as multiple TCP SYN connection attempts with S0 flags are present, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Validate if the suspicious IPs in anomalies (e.g., 89.3.89.164, 185.58.127.74) are involved in other attack types.

No ping flood is detected at this time.
