Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP in the 133.247.x.x range, indicating a distributed flood rather than a single host, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (133.247.152.121, 133.247.184.230, 133.247.76.175, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but logged as 0.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host (35.183.65.24) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle the malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to specifically detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are spoofed or compromised hosts to inform further remediation.
