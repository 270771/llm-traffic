Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 25 ICMP connections from source IP 143.224.94.6 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood, and the anomaly taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of this traffic.
- Although the anomaly CSV record references a different source IP (133.16.14.149) for heuristic 20, the current traffic matches the same heuristic and taxonomy class for ping flood detection.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.94.6; Destination IPs range from 133.26.144.130 through 133.26.144.159 and others in that subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 143.224.94.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host 143.224.94.6 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Correlate with other logs and alerts to check for coordinated or distributed attack patterns.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and classified under the "icmp_error" anomaly taxonomy.
