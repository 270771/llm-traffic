Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood); they mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (unknown), neither related to ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080, as SYN attacks can cause denial of service.
- Review network logs for ICMP traffic to confirm no ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated SYN floods.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10) and unknown anomalies (heuristic 999).
