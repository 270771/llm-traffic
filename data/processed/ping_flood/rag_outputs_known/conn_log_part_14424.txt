Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows no ICMP type field explicitly, but the log indicates only one instance of ICMP traffic between 202.124.53.30 and 64.57.61.121. There are not at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) as required to identify a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or related anomalies, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Collect more connection log data to identify repeated ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the same source IP. Monitor for any heuristic 20 matches or other anomaly indicators to reassess potential ping flood activity.
