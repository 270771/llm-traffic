Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, which are normal in traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 packets to confirm or rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
