Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly associates source IP 133.16.14.149 with heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and classifies it as 'icmp_error' under the taxonomy "Other."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to various destination IPs (e.g., 23.189.75.248, 189.228.89.172, 23.235.48.255, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  3. Monitor for further anomalous ICMP traffic and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
