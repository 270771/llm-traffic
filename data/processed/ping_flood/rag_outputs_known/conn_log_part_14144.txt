Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the destination IP 3.231.100.178 from multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.55.222, 133.247.48.240, 133.247.178.254, 133.247.132.16, 133.247.153.211, 161.67.42.226, etc.).
- The volume and distribution of these ICMP Echo Requests strongly match known ping flood patterns, where many hosts send ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Target IP: 3.231.100.178 (destination of the flood)
- Multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.247.x.x and 161.67.x.x ranges
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable (ICMP type 8)

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.231.100.178.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify the affected system owners and prepare for potential mitigation escalation, including upstream provider coordination if the flood volume increases.
