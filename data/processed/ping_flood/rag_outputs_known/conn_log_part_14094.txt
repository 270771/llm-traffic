Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to suspicious ICMP echo request floods) and fits the taxonomy class of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 54.193.126.151 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
