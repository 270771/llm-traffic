Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 50.239.214.145 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, satisfying the requirement for ping flood detection.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, confirming the volume threshold for ping flood.
- No known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, so the volume criterion stands.
- Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly reference this traffic or heuristic 20, the observed behavior aligns with a typical ping flood attack pattern. Assigning heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" is appropriate based on standard taxonomy.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.197.36, 157.17.25.198, 157.17.234.34, etc.) targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 50.239.214.145 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.
