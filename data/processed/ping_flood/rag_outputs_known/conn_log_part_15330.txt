Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries, only TCP and UDP connections.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records.
- The anomalies listed relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), none indicating ICMP or ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches some anomalies here.
- The taxonomy classes seen are 'ptmp' and 'heavy_hitter', none related to ICMP or ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further, focusing on source IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Verify firewall and IDS rules are properly configured to detect and mitigate SYN floods and other TCP-based attacks.
