Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from two IP addresses: 3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a typical ICMP ping flood attack, which would correspond to a heuristic related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.

**Involved IP addresses and ports:**
- Source IPs: 3.122.197.179, 54.183.76.138
- Destination IPs: Multiple in 163.252.x.x range
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the log shows ICMP protocol.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IPs 3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and expand blocking if additional sources are identified.
3. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
6. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
