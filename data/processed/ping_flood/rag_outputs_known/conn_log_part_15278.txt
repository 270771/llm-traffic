Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomalies detected (anomaly_772 and anomaly_782) are categorized under heuristic 10, which corresponds to SYN attacks, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 10 indicates SYN flood or SYN-based scanning activity, consistent with the TCP SYN flags seen in the conn.log entries (S0 state).
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests is present to suggest a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further by reviewing connection attempts from source IPs 185.102.240.231 and 89.3.89.164.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if firewall or IDS rules are properly configured to detect and mitigate SYN floods (heuristic 10).

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies correspond to SYN attack heuristic 10, which involves TCP SYN flag abuse rather than ICMP flooding.
