Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches were found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this fits heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.132.169, 133.247.19.5, 133.247.19.29, etc.) flooding destination 54.193.126.151. ICMP type 8 (ping) is confirmed; ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range. Additionally, deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing traffic from persistent offenders if attack volume escalates.
