Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 1, 3, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes over a longer time window.  
- Checking for other ICMP-based anomalies or different protocol anomalies.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
