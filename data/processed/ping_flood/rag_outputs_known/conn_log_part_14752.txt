Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 indicates other or unknown anomalies.
- No evidence of ICMP-based anomalies or ping flood patterns is found.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood anomalies (heuristic 10) detected in anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012, as these indicate potential TCP SYN flood attacks.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high SYN packet rates or connection failures.

No ping flood attack is detected at this time.
