Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to the same destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window (~0.002 seconds). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single IP is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances targeting one host.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.28.210, 133.247.1.23, 133.247.158.204, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet or compromised hosts in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate and potentially block offending IPs upstream.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood detection and mitigation steps.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting 54.193.126.151.
