Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are mostly 1 and 8, but only two instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) are observed from 13.211.197.216 to different destinations. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type 1 packet (type not equal to 8) does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same or multiple destinations.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (13.211.197.216, 203.78.178.225, 203.78.167.1) appear in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out low-rate ICMP scanning or reconnaissance activity.
