Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.134.27) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests flooding the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination without legitimate response patterns.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to overwhelming ICMP echo requests aimed at exhausting the targetâ€™s resources.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range; destination IP 34.25.134.27; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is a network layer protocol.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (34.25.134.27) for resource exhaustion and service degradation.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the offending IP range if the attack persists.
- Notify upstream providers and coordinate for broader mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
