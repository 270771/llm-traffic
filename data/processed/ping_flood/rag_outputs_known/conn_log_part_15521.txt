Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets indicating flooding. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious activity.

Since ICMP type 3 is a standard error message, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no other attack type can be confidently inferred.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets or additional anomalies from these IPs could be a prudent next step.
