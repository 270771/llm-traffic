Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present (from 186.32.35.122 to 163.252.84.103). The other entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The threshold for a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no repeated ICMP type 8 packets are seen.  
- Therefore, the traffic does not match the volume or pattern of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if 186.32.35.122 or 163.252.84.103 appear in future anomaly records or match known suspicious heuristics.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
