Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP connections are present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over time.  
- Checking for other suspicious traffic patterns or anomalies in related logs.  
- Gathering heuristic and taxonomy definitions to better classify future anomalies.
