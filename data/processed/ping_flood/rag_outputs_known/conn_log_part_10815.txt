Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- The source IP 54.200.201.221 is repeatedly sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range, consistent with a ping flood pattern where a single source floods one or more targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Other source IPs (133.247.x.x) are also sending ICMP type 8 packets to 35.183.65.24, suggesting multiple sources targeting the same destination, which may indicate a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard heuristics for ping flood detection:
  - Heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) is not matched here.
  - The most likely heuristic is a generic ICMP flood detection heuristic (commonly heuristic 1 or 2 in many taxonomies).
  - Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Primary attacker IP: 54.200.201.221 (source)
- Other attacker IPs: 133.247.144.254, 133.247.55.45, 133.247.65.28, 133.247.22.43, 133.247.182.108, 133.247.65.158, 133.247.182.85, 133.247.55.214, 133.247.39.131, 133.247.37.150, 133.247.37.57 (sources)
- Primary victim IPs: 203.78.182.89, 203.78.180.59, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.173.222, 203.78.181.77, 203.78.190.225, 203.78.183.157, 203.78.189.176, 203.78.183.81, 35.183.65.24 (destinations)
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified attacker IPs, especially 54.200.201.221.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if business operations allow.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact or escalation.
