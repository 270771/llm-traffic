Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 required for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 11 is Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and check if their count exceeds 10 from the same source or to the same destination.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving known suspicious IPs or ports once heuristic context is available.
