Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; no ICMP traffic is present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP connections or packets are logged.
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (unknown), but none reference heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the many TCP SYN (S0) flags seen in the logs, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, not ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets (S0 flag) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for SYN flood signatures.
- Review anomaly_782 (heuristic 10, SYN attack) for source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for further suspicious activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 stands for ping flood attacks (ICMP Echo Request floods).
- Current anomalies and traffic do not match this heuristic or taxonomy.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on potential SYN-based attacks indicated by heuristic 10.
