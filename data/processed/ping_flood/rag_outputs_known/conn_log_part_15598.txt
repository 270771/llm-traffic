Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request). There is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is evident from this single OTH (other) connection log entry with ICMP type 3. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns or anomalies.
