Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly associates source IP 133.16.14.149 with heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class for this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of excessive ICMP echo requests causing network disruption.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; multiple destination IPs including 23.77.42.252, 95.101.133.228, 104.65.252.0, 23.248.69.250, 23.249.200.3, 23.216.136.5, 104.112.114.0, 173.50.207.4, 23.64.12.0, 92.139.184.4, 23.95.43.7.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or related anomalies from this or other IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host associated with 133.16.14.149 to identify compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
5. Inform network operations to prepare for potential collateral network degradation and coordinate mitigation steps.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
