Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows traffic from 133.227.58.120 to 193.44.240.177 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Therefore, it does not match the ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP entry shows traffic from 202.16.238.27 to 133.105.48.3 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is a ping request, but there is only a single packet logged, not a flood or high volume of requests indicative of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 packets if unusual, as they may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but are not related to ping floods.
