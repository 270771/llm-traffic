Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic does not contain ICMP type 8 packets, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 and destination IP 133.105.230.151 for any other suspicious activity or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for ICMP Echo Requests or high-volume traffic patterns.
