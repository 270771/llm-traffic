Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries show many S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources targeting the same destination.
