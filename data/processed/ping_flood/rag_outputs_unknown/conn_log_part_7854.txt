Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping floods, but the volume and pattern do not indicate flooding. The entries show isolated ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs to different destination IPs, each with a count of 1 packet (`- 1` at the end), not a high-rate or sustained flood. Additionally, one entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and rate from these IPs is recommended to detect any escalation.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns to better detect anomalies in the future.
