Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping flood traffic.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - 173.20.80.33 → 163.45.129.195 (type 8)  
  - 133.227.218.107 → 44.202.241.89 (type 8)  
- However, these entries show very low packet counts (30 and 0 respectively) and no signs of rapid repeated requests or high volume typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (11, 3, 0) are present, indicating other ICMP messages like Time Exceeded (11) or Destination Unreachable (3), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. If heuristics were available, a ping flood would likely fall under a heuristic for ICMP flood or DoS attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 173.20.80.33 and 133.227.218.107 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) volume from these or other IPs.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messages that might indicate network issues or other attack types.
