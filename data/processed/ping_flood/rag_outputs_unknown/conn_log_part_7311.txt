Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request" messages, not type 8 ("echo request") required for ping floods. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP but not echo requests, it does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the purpose of the timestamp request ICMP traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of reconnaissance or other ICMP-based probing.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request (type 8) packets that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
