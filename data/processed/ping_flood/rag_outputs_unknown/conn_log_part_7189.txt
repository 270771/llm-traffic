Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the pattern does not match a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm or rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from any source IP to any destination IP, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
