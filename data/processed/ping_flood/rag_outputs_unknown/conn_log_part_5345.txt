Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (which would focus on ICMP Echo Requests) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are being captured elsewhere or if logging for ICMP is disabled/missing.  
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods or port scans, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not ping floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.
