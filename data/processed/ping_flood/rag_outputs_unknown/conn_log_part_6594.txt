Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that these ICMP messages are normal network error or control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 1 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume that could indicate a developing ping flood.
