Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. However, ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types and do not inherently indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior or volume outside this snippet. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods. If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
