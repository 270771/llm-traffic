Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" and low packet count (16) further indicate normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood. However, monitoring for a surge in ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 39.92.98.195 is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
