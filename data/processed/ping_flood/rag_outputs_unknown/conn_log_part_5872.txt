Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP record shows traffic from 202.101.171.237 to 206.130.242.141 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). The second record is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable). Since neither record has ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but by standard taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 11 and 3 indicate network diagnostic or error messages, not flooding or DoS.  
- No evidence of high volume or repeated Echo Requests is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues causing excessive error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
