Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (as indicated by the fifth and eleventh fields showing 0 or 1), but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the given data. The connection states are all "OTH" (other), and packet counts are minimal (1 packet each), which does not indicate flooding or volumetric attack behavior.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If further investigation is desired, monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency or volume from the same source IPs would be the next step to detect potential ping floods.
