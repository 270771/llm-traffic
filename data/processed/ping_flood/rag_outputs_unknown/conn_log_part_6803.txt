Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013211.19). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood." These are standard classifications for ping flood attacks in network security.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods from this or other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider blacklisting the attacker IP if it is confirmed malicious and not a false positive.  
5. Review and harden ICMP handling policies to prevent similar volumetric attacks in the future.
