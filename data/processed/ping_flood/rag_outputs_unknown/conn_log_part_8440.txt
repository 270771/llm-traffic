Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an attack initiation.  
- No high volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.  

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 and 0 traffic is normal network behavior related to diagnostics and responses, not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if any other logs show sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with network performance issues or alerts for further analysis.
