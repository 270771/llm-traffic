Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the TCP SYN flood possibility, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with flags like S0 and SH, which may indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any ICMP traffic for future detection.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to identify potential other attack types.
