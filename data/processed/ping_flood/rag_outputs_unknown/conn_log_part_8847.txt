Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 58.37.194.100 to destination 163.45.128.83, with a single packet and no signs of flooding (only 1 packet, no high frequency or volume). The other ICMP entry has type 13 (Timestamp Request), which is not type 8 and therefore not a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types if they appear.
