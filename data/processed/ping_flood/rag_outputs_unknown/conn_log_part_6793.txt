Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP error messages from the same sources, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts. Further investigation should focus on traffic volume and patterns rather than these isolated ICMP type 3 messages.
