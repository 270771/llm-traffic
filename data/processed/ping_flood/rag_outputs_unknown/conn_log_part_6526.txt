Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 203.78.217.206, but it shows a single packet (count=0 or 1) without a high volume or rapid repetition indicative of a flood. Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are error or control messages, not Echo Requests. There is no evidence of sustained or excessive ICMP Echo Request traffic that characterizes a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of repeated ICMP type 8 packets excludes a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency from any source IP, especially 172.23.68.231. If volume spikes, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review other logs or IDS alerts for related suspicious activity.
