Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the lack of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood heuristics, which typically focus on high-rate ICMP echo requests.

Next steps: Investigate the TCP SYN packets with flags indicating connection attempts (S0 states) for possible SYN flood or scanning activity, as many entries show failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state). Focus on IPs with repeated connection attempts to multiple ports, which may indicate reconnaissance or other DoS attempts unrelated to ICMP ping floods.
