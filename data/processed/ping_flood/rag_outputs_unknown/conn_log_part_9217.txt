Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 0, 1, 3, 11, and 8 only once but with zero packets and bytes transferred, indicating no actual echo request traffic generating a flood. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (3), echo reply (0), time exceeded (11), and other control messages, which are normal or indicative of network issues but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping floods.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance once available.
