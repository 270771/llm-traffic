Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections from source IP 35.83.191.13 to different destination IPs (163.45.192.92 and 163.45.193.91) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages. The rapid succession of these Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," typically classified under "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" in anomaly taxonomies. Assigning heuristic number 1 (High volume ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" is appropriate here.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13  
- Target/destination IPs: 163.45.192.92, 163.45.193.91  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious sources.  
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.  
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact.  
- Consider blacklisting the attacker IP if confirmed malicious and persistent.
