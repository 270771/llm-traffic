Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log snippet indicates ICMP protocol with no further detail on type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the required condition for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type details if possible from more detailed logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other sources to detect potential future ping floods.
