Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here showing "icmp" protocol and the ICMP type is indicated by the "1" in the destination port field), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in other logs or a higher volume of ICMP traffic from the same source IP (163.45.185.71) to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
