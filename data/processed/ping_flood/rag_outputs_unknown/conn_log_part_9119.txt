Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP echo reply, not a flood of echo requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (218.73.175.208) would be a prudent next step to detect potential future ping floods.
