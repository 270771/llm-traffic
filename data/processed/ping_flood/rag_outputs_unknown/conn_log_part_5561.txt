Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6).
- There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- No heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP logs or other network captures are available to confirm no ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN failures (S0 flags) are present, which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not flooding.
- If suspicious TCP SYN floods or scans are suspected, apply heuristics related to SYN flood detection and port scanning taxonomy.
