Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 13. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request." Neither is type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood attack. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types are unusually frequent, they might indicate other network issues or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or other network problem.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to identify potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other ICMP types.
