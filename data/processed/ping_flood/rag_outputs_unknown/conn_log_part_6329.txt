Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 11 traffic often relates to traceroute or network path issues rather than flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs sending repeated ICMP type 11 messages (202.250.216.227, 133.227.58.122, 202.250.230.254) to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
