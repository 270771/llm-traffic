Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed are 3, 1, and 0. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Type 3 = Destination Unreachable  
- Type 1 = ICMP Host Unreachable (or possibly ICMP Destination Unreachable - varies by implementation)  
- Type 0 = Echo Reply  

Since no ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack classifications.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 130.187.37.249 sending multiple ICMP error messages (types 3 and 1) to different destinations, which could indicate misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Consider enabling logging or alerting on unusual ICMP error message volumes to detect other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
