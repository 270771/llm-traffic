Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to any destination IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity, as the TCP SYN failures may warrant further analysis.
