Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent in rapid succession from multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.206.244.254, 133.243.136.58, 157.206.225.8) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223).
- The extremely short inter-arrival times (on the order of microseconds to milliseconds) and high volume of ICMP Echo Requests are consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack pattern.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, which matches the known criterion for ping flood detection.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this behavior aligns with a classic DoS heuristic: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single or few destinations."
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: 157.206.244.254, 157.206.216.245, 133.243.136.58, 157.206.225.8, 157.206.88.31, 157.206.127.241, 133.243.87.200, 133.243.167.237, 157.206.63.2, 157.206.142.253, 157.206.216.237, 133.243.201.24, 157.206.150.200, 157.206.4.55, 157.206.206.166, 157.206.72.23, 157.206.210.222, 157.206.127.223, 157.206.155.15, 157.206.1.6
- Destination IPs: 163.84.73.84, 44.198.161.223
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns, including other ICMP types or protocols.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if business operations allow.
