Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The S0 state in Zeek conn.log indicates SYN packets sent but no response, often linked to port scanning or reconnaissance.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.146, 89.247.69.145) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or inspect ICMP logs separately to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to catch ping floods early.
