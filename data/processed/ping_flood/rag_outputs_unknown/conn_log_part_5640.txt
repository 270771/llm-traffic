Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are either 3, 8, or 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates a ping flood. Here, only one record shows type 8 (14.162.86.230 â†’ 203.78.138.253), but it is a single event with no volume or frequency indicative of flooding. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be directly referenced. However, the absence of repeated ICMP type 8 packets or high volume traffic suggests no ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency, which would warrant further investigation. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or other anomalies.
