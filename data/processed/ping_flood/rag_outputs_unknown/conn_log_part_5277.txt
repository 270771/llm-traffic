Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not shown here.
- The logs show multiple failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are given, the observed traffic aligns with typical port scanning or connection attempts, often classified under reconnaissance or scanning heuristics (commonly heuristic #1 or #2 in many taxonomies).
- The S0 state indicates connection attempts without completion, typical of scanning.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts (e.g., 185.138.73.101, 89.247.69.146) for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection patterns.
