Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 1 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 1 and 3 correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable messages, respectively, which do not indicate a ping flood. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Echo Reply) messages to ensure they are not part of another network issue or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- If anomalies arise, collect more detailed logs and anomaly data for further analysis.
