Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, not `8`. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are indicative of ping floods, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 202.250.230.253 and 60.13.153.235 to determine if it is part of a different ICMP-based activity or misconfiguration. Monitoring for increased volume or other ICMP types may help identify other potential threats.
