Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with ICMP type 0 (likely Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristics or taxonomy data are available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for other suspicious activity, especially if ICMP type 8 traffic appears later.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
