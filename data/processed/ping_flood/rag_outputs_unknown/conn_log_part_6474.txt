Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state `OTH` indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not imply a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP `202.250.216.227` sending ICMP type 11 messages to `185.172.187.21` to determine if these are part of a network scanning or traceroute activity, which is benign or expected in some contexts. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
