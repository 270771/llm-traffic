Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood. The absence of ICMP entries means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type can be confidently identified from these TCP connection attempts alone.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets or repeated connection attempts with ICMP protocol.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for potential ICMP-based anomalies.
