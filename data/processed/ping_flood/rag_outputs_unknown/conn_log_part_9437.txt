Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.199.185.249) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013233.35xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP echo requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled under a taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 3.199.185.249 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in the 157.206.x.x range
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.199.185.249.
2. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are confirmed malicious.
4. Monitor the victim host and network for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential escalation.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or cloud-based DDoS protection services.
