Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The single ICMP-related entry (timestamp 1641013249.040673) shows ICMP type 8 is not indicated; rather, it is a TCP RST segment with no ICMP echo request flood pattern.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with SYN flags set (S0 state) that are failing to establish connections, which may indicate a SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Focus on IPs such as 89.247.69.* and 161.95.19.235 for potential scanning behavior. Further packet capture and analysis of ICMP traffic should be conducted to conclusively rule out ping floods.
