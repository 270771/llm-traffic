Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.222, but there is only a single connection log entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP Echo Request floods, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ICMP Flood," but these do not apply here due to lack of volume or repetition.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. Investigate if any host shows a sudden surge in ICMP Echo Requests, which could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
