Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 107.102.62.64 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-volume ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS taxonomies).  
- The taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flooding.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attackers: Multiple source IPs in the 130.187.x.x range (e.g., 130.187.239.200, 130.187.239.199, 130.187.44.170, etc.)  
- Victim: 107.102.62.64  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.187.0.0/16 or more specific subnets).  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 107.102.62.64.  
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the victim host for service degradation or outages.  
4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious and not legitimate users.  
5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
