Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a small set of destination IPs, primarily 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223, within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013226.20xxxx). The volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where attackers overwhelm the target with excessive ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Targets: 163.84.73.84, 44.198.161.223  
- Sources: Multiple IPs including 157.206.163.17, 133.243.254.239, 157.206.74.9, 133.243.251.255, 157.206.127.226, 157.206.160.254, and others.  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor the affected hosts (163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223) for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential DoS impact.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on critical infrastructure if not required for legitimate operations.  
6. Collect and analyze further logs to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack or reconnaissance activity.
