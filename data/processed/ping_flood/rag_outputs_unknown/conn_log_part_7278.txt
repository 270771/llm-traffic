Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port field (11), which corresponds to ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 sending ICMP type 11 packets to 177.180.90.33, as ICMP Time Exceeded messages may indicate network scanning or routing issues. Monitor for increased volume or patterns that could suggest other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
