Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.125.147, 133.243.125.2, 133.243.125.20, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (54.196.70.79) in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.196.70.79. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/protocol.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.196.70.79.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block excessive ICMP traffic from these source IPs.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
  5. Monitor for collateral effects and ensure legitimate ICMP traffic is not unduly blocked.
