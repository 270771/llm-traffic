Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (which is 0 here), but the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no established session, which is typical for ICMP but does not imply flooding.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing full ICMP packet details, including explicit ICMP type and rate of packets from 203.78.140.213 to 162.113.225.22, to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance. Monitoring for high ICMP packet rates or repeated Echo Requests would be necessary to confirm any flooding behavior.
