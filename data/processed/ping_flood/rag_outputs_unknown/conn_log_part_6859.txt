Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single connection record without evidence of high volume or flooding behavior. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious activity.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned. Generally, ping flood attacks correspond to heuristic patterns involving high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next Steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (54.236.220.60) to the destination (163.45.117.101). If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network traffic for other ICMP types that may indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
