Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, these ICMP types typically relate to network diagnostics or error reporting, not flooding attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from single sources to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.
