Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- Only two entries have ICMP type 8: from 49.90.51.21 to 203.78.135.92 and from 35.52.110.20 to 133.105.129.5.  
- However, these are isolated requests with normal packet sizes (32 and 1792 bytes) and no evidence of rapid, repeated requests from the same source to the same destination.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 3 is a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping floods fall under heuristic categories related to ICMP abuse and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency.  
- Investigate if any source IPs generate sustained high-volume ICMP traffic.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential DoS conditions.
