Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The presence of only TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP connections without anomalies does not match ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state (connection attempts without completion), which may indicate a SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for SYN flood or port scanning heuristics is recommended. Collect ICMP traffic logs to confirm or rule out ICMP-based attacks in the future.
