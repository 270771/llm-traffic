Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port value "11" and destination port "0". However, ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, and here the source port is 11, which corresponds to ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state "OTH" indicates an ICMP message that is not a typical echo request or reply.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 messages between these IPs to determine if there is a network misconfiguration or other issues causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitoring for other ICMP types and volumes may help detect different ICMP-based attacks.
