Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled in Zeek or other monitoring tools. Look for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods. Also, review connection attempts for possible scanning or reconnaissance activity.
