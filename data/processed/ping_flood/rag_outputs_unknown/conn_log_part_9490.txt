Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from source IP 157.206.7.55 to two different destinations, each with a single packet (count=1). This low volume and lack of repeated or rapid ICMP Echo Requests do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets overwhelming the target.

The other ICMP entry (type 13) is unrelated to ping floods, as only ICMP type 8 is relevant for such attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, typical heuristics for ping floods involve detecting high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from 157.206.7.55 or other sources. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood or denial-of-service activity.
