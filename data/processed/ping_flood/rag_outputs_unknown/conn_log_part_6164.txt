Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the destination port field (which is 0 here), but more importantly, the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags do not indicate a typical flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and frequency. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from 203.78.140.213 to 54.25.190.168 that could indicate a developing ping flood.
