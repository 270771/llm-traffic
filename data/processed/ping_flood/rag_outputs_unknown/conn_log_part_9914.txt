Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is not explicitly provided in the Zeek conn.log snippet, but the connection state is "OTH" (other), and there is no indication that the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type field in more detail from raw packet captures or extended logs to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 203.78.135.66 to the destination 177.231.149.143 to detect potential future ping floods.
