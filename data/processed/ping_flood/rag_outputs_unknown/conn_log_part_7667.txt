Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, one entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not a ping request and thus not part of a ping flood. The other entry has ICMP type 8, but there is only a single instance with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to classify as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic for ping flood would involve detection of high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source IP targeting a destination IP.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 sending ICMP type 8 to 163.45.146.121 for any unusual traffic patterns.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential flooding behavior.
