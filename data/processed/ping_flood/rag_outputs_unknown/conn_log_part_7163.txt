Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.169 and destination IP 64.190.198.213 for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages that could indicate network problems or scanning activity.
