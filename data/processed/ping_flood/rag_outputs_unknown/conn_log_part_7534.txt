Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 0 (fields indicating ICMP type are 3 and 0 respectively), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" and type 0 to "Echo Reply," which are normal control messages and responses, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP type 3 or 0 messages that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
