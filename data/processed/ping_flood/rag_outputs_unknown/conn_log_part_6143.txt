Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0) for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to SYN scan detection and monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same IPs or to the same ports.
