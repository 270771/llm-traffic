Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even the single UDP entry (first line) is not ICMP, and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the observed traffic aligns with typical port scanning or connection attempts (heuristic: SYN scan detection; taxonomy: reconnaissance).
- Further investigation should focus on the IPs with repeated SYN failures (e.g., 89.247.69.180, 89.247.66.138) to confirm if scanning or other reconnaissance is occurring.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
- Correlate with IDS/IPS logs for scanning or brute force attempts.
- Investigate repeated SYN failures for possible reconnaissance or early-stage attacks.
