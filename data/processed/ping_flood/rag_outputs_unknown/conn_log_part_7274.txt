Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping flood attacks. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP type 1 and 0 packets are present; these could be normal network diagnostics or responses to other network issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or high-frequency ICMP traffic from the same source IPs (203.78.136.34 or 221.17.200.42) to detect potential future ping floods.
