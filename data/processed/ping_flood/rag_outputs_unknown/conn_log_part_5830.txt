Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) indicate error or control messages, not ping requests. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages often relate to network troubleshooting or misconfigurations rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network issues or other forms of reconnaissance. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
