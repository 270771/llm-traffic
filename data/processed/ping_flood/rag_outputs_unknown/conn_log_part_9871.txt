Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) sent rapidly from two source IPs (3.243.126.119 and 69.232.165.137) to multiple destination IPs within a short time frame (timestamps within seconds). This pattern of high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which overwhelms targets with excessive echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High-rate ICMP Echo Request Flooding**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Attackers: 3.243.126.119 and 69.232.165.137 (source IPs)
  - Targets: Multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x and 163.45.x.x ranges
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (echo request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking IPs.
4. Monitor network traffic for any collateral impact and verify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack volume escalates.
