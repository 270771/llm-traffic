Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no anomaly or heuristic data is provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- Typically, ping flood attacks fall under ICMP-based DoS heuristics, but none apply here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (e.g., icmp.log) to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated failed connection attempts that might indicate other DoS or scanning activity.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
