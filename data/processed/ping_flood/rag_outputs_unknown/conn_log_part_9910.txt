Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is not composed of ICMP Echo Requests, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 221.132.209.134 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for any other unusual traffic patterns or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other protocol misuse.
