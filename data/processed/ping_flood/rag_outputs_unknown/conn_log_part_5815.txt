Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 128, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 128 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match ping flood criteria, no heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps: Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages to ensure no misconfigurations or network issues are causing excessive unreachable responses. Also, verify if the ICMP Echo Replies (type 128) are expected responses to legitimate pings.
