Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 163.45.185.120 sending ICMP type 3 packets and 203.78.140.213 sending ICMP type 11 packets to ensure these are legitimate network diagnostic messages and not part of a reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
