Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic shows multiple TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (likely SIP signaling), but none match the ICMP ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy can be made.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the repeated TCP SYN attempts (S0) for possible SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Review UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential SIP-related anomalies.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Apply heuristics related to SYN flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: "Excessive SYN packets without completion") and taxonomy class "DoS/Scanning" for the observed TCP behavior.
