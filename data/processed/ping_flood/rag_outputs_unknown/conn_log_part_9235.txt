Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity related to these IPs or ports.

Heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, but based on standard ICMP type definitions, this traffic does not align with ping flood heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP unreachable messages, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
