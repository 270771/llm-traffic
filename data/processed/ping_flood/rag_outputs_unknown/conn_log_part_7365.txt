Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the provided Zeek conn.log entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern of these entries do not indicate a flood. Only two ICMP Echo Requests are logged within a very short time frame, which is insufficient to classify as a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. The ICMP traffic appears normal.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs (133.243.126.48 and 133.243.126.49) to 139.76.135.5. If the rate spikes significantly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
