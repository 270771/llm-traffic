Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP traffic is likely benign or related to network diagnostics other than ping floods.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 13 traffic between 133.227.130.250 and 163.84.73.84 to ensure it is expected behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
