Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields (source port 11, destination port 0), but for ICMP traffic, the "port" fields often represent ICMP type and code. Here, the destination port is 0, which corresponds to ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.140.213 and destination IP 180.187.124.246 for other suspicious activity patterns or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for ICMP type 8 traffic or high volume ICMP packets.
