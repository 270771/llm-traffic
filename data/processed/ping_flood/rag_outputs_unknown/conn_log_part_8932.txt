Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are being captured elsewhere or if logging for ICMP is enabled.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Enable or review anomaly detection heuristics related to TCP SYN floods or port scans for further analysis.
