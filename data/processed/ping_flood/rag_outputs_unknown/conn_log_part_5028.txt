Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP traffic and no suspicious patterns in TCP/UDP connections, no other specific attack type is evident from this data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs specifically to detect any potential ping floods or ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture type and code fields for accurate detection.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IPs.
