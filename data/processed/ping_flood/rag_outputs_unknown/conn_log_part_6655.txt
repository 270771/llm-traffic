Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0, 1, 3, and 7, but none with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Entry 1: ICMP type 11 (code 203.78.143.78 port 0) — not type 8  
- Entry 2: ICMP type 3 — Destination Unreachable, not type 8  
- Entry 3: ICMP type 1 — Echo Reply, not type 8  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages, as these may indicate network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
