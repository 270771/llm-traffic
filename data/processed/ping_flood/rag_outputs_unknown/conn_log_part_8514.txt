Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 8. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic can indicate a ping flood. Here, only one record has ICMP type 8 (from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.223.245), but it is a single connection record, not a flood pattern. The other two entries are ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 record for potential isolated scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) to detect any emerging ping flood.  
- If ICMP type 3 messages increase, investigate possible network issues or misrouted traffic.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would require multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame.  
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

No attack is currently present.
