Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 0 and 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for a ping flood requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. Types 0 and 1 correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable or other ICMP messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood under the known heuristic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity, as multiple ICMP types and OTH (other) connection states may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately filtered or rate-limited.
