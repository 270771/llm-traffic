Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic consists mainly of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on ports like 5060 (SIP) and 53 (DNS), but none indicate ICMP ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, the heuristic for ping flood (ICMP Echo Request flood) does not apply.
- The taxonomy class for ping flood would be “Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood,” which is not observed here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the repeated failed TCP connection attempts (S0 states) for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Monitor UDP traffic on port 5060 for SIP-related anomalies, as multiple failed attempts from 45.121.95.154 to various IPs may indicate suspicious behavior.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
