Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 222.175.165.148 to destination 163.45.194.187, but it shows only 1 packet with 28 bytes, which is insufficient volume to indicate a flood. The other ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods. No high packet rate or volume consistent with ping flood patterns is observed.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic typically relates to network diagnostics or traceroute, not attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. Investigate if the source IP 222.175.165.148 repeatedly sends echo requests at high rates, which could indicate early-stage reconnaissance or a developing ping flood.
