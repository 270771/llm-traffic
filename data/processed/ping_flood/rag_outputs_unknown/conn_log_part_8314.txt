Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood attack. Ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm the target. Here, the traffic shows a single ICMP Echo Reply from 133.105.74.54 to 172.23.68.231, which does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in other logs or over time from these IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.74.54.
