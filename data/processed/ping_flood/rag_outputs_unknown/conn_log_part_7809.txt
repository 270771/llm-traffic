Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting primarily the IP 174.95.41.114 from a wide range of source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the target with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target." The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 174.95.41.114 (receiving the flood)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.166.254, 157.206.166.63, 157.206.118.123, 157.206.146.182, and many others.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 174.95.41.114.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts and adjust mitigation thresholds accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if ICMP is not required for legitimate operations.
