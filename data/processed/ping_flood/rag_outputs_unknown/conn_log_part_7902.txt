Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry from 133.227.58.122 to 138.134.235.128 shows ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). The second entry from 133.243.206.29 to 92.5.174.251 shows ICMP type 8, which is an Echo Request, but there is only a single such packet logged, not a flood or high volume of requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood (ICMP flood) heuristic would involve repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high frequency from a single source to a target.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs over a short time window.  
- Monitor for patterns of repeated ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential flooding.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based anomalies or different attack vectors if suspicious behavior continues.
