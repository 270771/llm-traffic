Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criteria. The second entry is ICMP type 1 (Host Unreachable), also not type 8. Since ping floods require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or other ICMP-related diagnostics but not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 1 messages to ensure network stability and rule out misconfigurations or other network problems. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
