Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the source port field (11) and destination port field (0). For ICMP traffic, the source port typically represents the ICMP type. Here, the source port is 11, which corresponds to ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.101.171.237 sending ICMP type 11 packets to 207.139.29.92 to determine if this is related to network scanning or traceroute activity, which may be benign or part of reconnaissance. Monitor for any increase in volume or changes in ICMP types.
