Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections from different source IPs (157.206.147.193, 157.206.252.152, 157.206.250.249, 157.206.55.243, 157.206.194.189, 157.206.203.86, 157.206.252.137) all targeting the same destination IP (3.199.185.249) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number is **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination**.  
- The taxonomy class is **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: 157.206.147.193, 157.206.252.152, 157.206.250.249, 157.206.55.243, 157.206.194.189, 157.206.203.86, 157.206.252.137  
- Destination IP: 3.199.185.249  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.199.185.249.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
