Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. Instead, the traffic shows ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are typically indicative of network error messages or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, the presence of multiple ICMP error messages could warrant further investigation into network misconfigurations or scanning activity.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusually high ICMP traffic volume. Correlate with other logs to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
