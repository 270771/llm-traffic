Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 35.87.78.209 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013211.015â€“.019). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target IP is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a host with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade its availability.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" often labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.  
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (common heuristic for volumetric ICMP flood).  
- Taxonomy class: DoS/Disruption.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 35.87.78.209 (no port for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.199.2, 133.227.132.249, 133.227.208.8, 133.227.155.93, 133.227.130.250, 133.227.200.5, 133.227.148.249, 133.227.115.69, 133.227.218.5, 133.227.130.189, 133.227.224.194, 133.227.144.254, 133.227.183.249, 133.227.224.6, 133.227.226.1, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 35.87.78.209.  
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
- Monitor the target host for performance degradation and ensure critical services remain operational.  
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.  
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack and update firewall/IDS rules accordingly.
