Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated failed connection attempts that might indicate other attack types.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture potential ping floods in the future.
