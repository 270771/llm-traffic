Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance and taxonomy class "Network Scanning."

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion to determine if a SYN scan or other reconnaissance activity is occurring. Collect ICMP logs or packet captures to verify if any ICMP-based attacks are present.
