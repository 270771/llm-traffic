Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 13 (Timestamp Request), also not type 8.  
- No anomalies or heuristics are provided to suggest other attack types.  

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly records are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.250.230.253 and 157.206.119.38) for unusual ICMP activity patterns or other suspicious behavior over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or high ICMP traffic volume that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
