Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0, which for ICMP corresponds to type/code fields), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply) to ensure it is not part of a reflection or amplification attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs.
