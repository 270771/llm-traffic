Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the log are 3, 1, and 0. None of these are type 8, which is the only ICMP type that indicates an echo request (ping) used in ping flood attacks. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," type 1 is "Host Unreachable," and type 0 is "Echo Reply." These do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8).

No anomalies or heuristics related to ping floods are present in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. Since no ping flood is detected, no immediate security response specific to ping floods is required.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 1 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based diagnostics or errors. Monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP error messages could be useful to detect other network problems or reconnaissance attempts.
