Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1 or 0 or 11 (fields 4 and 11 combined indicate ICMP type and code). None of the entries show ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Without ICMP type 8, these packets are not echo requests and thus do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) packets, as these may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to rule out other ICMP-based attacks such as smurf or ICMP unreachable floods.
