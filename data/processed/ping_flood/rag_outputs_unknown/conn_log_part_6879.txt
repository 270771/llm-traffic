Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 133.105.212.151, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single packet recorded, not a flood or high volume of ICMP echo requests.  
- The second log entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 133.243.73.65 to 3.192.28.218, which is a response, not an attack.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a destination are present, which is required to identify a ping flood.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given this, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume or rate of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- If ICMP traffic spikes, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood."
