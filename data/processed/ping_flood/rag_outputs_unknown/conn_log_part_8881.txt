Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 is typically related to network troubleshooting or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP Time Exceeded messages are being generated from 133.227.58.120 to external IPs. This could indicate routing loops or misconfigurations causing excessive ICMP error traffic, which may impact network performance. Monitoring for volume spikes or related anomalies is recommended.
