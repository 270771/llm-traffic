Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. However, the volume and pattern of these ICMP type 8 packets do not indicate flooding. The timestamps and counts show isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a high-rate flood. The entry with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame, which is not present here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request frequency from these IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts.
