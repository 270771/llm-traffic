Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry (from 133.227.58.120 to 106.15.153.52) has ICMP type 11, which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry (from 157.206.202.224 to 44.198.161.223) has ICMP type 8, which is echo request, but there is only a single packet recorded (count=0 or 1), not a flood or high volume of echo requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic (time exceeded) for possible network issues or traceroute activity, but it is not an attack indicator here.
