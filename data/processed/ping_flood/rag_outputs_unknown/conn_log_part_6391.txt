Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type 0 in the Zeek conn.log snippet (indicated by the ICMP code field being 0 and no explicit type 8 shown). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets without the volume or type characteristics of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or sustained high-rate ICMP traffic that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
