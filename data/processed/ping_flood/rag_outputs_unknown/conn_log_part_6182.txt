Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network scanning or misconfiguration rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network reachability issues or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
