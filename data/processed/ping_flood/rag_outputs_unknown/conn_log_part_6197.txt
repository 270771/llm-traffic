Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state) for possible TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on these TCP connection attempts.
