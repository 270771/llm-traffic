Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column, which is "3" for both source and destination ports. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is "Echo Request" used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood.
