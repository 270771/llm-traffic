Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as the current logs only show TCP connection attempts (mostly SYN scans or failed connections indicated by S0 state). Monitoring ICMP logs or enabling ICMP-specific Zeek scripts would help detect ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.
