Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field indicated as "0" in the source port column (which is typical for ICMP since ports are not used), but crucially, the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for ping floods, which rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other type of attack. The connection states are "OTH" (other), and the flags indicate no established sessions or retransmissions typical of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the exact ICMP type fields if available from more detailed logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional network or host logs for further analysis.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected attack pattern.
