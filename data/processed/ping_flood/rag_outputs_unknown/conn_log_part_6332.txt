Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 11 and 1, respectively. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this traffic is normal ICMP control messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 11 and 1 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
