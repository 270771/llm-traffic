Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the port field being 0), which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP packets and no other suspicious indicators, this traffic does not represent a ping flood or another clear attack type.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual behavior over a longer time window, and verify if ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) appear in other logs. Monitoring for high ICMP request rates or other anomaly indicators is recommended.
