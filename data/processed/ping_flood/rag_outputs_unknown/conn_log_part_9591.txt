Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.254.197.94) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.008 seconds per packet). This pattern matches the classic ping flood behavior where an attacker overwhelms targets with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Attacker/source: 54.254.197.94 (source port 8, ICMP echo request)
  - Multiple victims/destinations: 163.45.x.x subnet (e.g., 163.45.15.253, 163.45.252.12, 163.45.3.46, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (echo request), confirming ping flood.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.254.197.94 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other volumetric attacks.
3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting on internal routers to mitigate impact.
5. Investigate the source IP for possible compromise or abuse reports and consider upstream provider notification for mitigation.
