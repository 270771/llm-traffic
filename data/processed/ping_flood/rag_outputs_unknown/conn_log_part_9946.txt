Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP Destination Unreachable messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or unreachable hosts, but this is not indicative of a ping flood.
