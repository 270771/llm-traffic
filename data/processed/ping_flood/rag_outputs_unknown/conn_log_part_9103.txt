Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify as an attack.

No heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned due to lack of data. Further investigation should focus on the source IP 203.78.147.24 and destination IP 89.247.69.144 for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-based issues, but no immediate threat is evident from this log.
