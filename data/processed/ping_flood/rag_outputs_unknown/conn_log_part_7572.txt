Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the presence of "OTH" state and zero counts of typical echo request packets indicate no ICMP type 8 traffic). Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to echo requests (pings), and none are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests means this traffic is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further to determine if it corresponds to other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, time exceeded) which might indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic volume from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
