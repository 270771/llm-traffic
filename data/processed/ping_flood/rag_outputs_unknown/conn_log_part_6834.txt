Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages between 133.243.229.91 and 138.58.89.149 to determine if network misconfigurations or other issues are present. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
