Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 0 (from the 6th and 11th fields in the log lines), not type 8 which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither indicates an ongoing ping flood, which would require a high volume of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard ICMP behavior, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 1 messages (202.244.69.50 â†’ 89.247.66.56) as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
