Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0 or 13, not type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Therefore, these packets do not represent ping flood traffic.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the ICMP types are not echo requests, this traffic does not match ping flood heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 13 (Timestamp) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Monitor for any unusual volume or patterns in these ICMP types that could indicate other attack vectors.
