Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs. Investigate if these ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.
