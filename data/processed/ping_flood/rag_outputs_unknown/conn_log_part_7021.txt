Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood, but monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 could be considered if network troubleshooting or reconnaissance is suspected. Further investigation could include checking for repeated ICMP type 11 packets from the source IP 180.72.177.87 to identify potential scanning activity.
