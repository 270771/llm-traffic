Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (133.243.146.247, 133.243.146.240, 133.243.73.11, 133.243.232.253) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (3.17.177.6) in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single host, typically classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy.
- Involved IPs: Sources - 133.243.146.247, 133.243.146.240, 133.243.73.11, 133.243.232.253; Destination - 3.17.177.6; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor the destination host (3.17.177.6) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating traffic from the attacking IPs.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
