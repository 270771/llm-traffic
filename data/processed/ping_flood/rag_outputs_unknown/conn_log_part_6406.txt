Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one record has type 8 (from 172.23.68.231 to 133.251.150.159), but it is a single connection with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The other two entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious patterns or taxonomy classes are matched.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 for repeated ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window to confirm if a flood is developing.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or rapid repeated connections.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network issues related to ICMP type 11 messages.

No current evidence supports a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.
