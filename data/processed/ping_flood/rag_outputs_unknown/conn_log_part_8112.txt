Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and timing of these requests do not indicate a flood. The timestamps are spread out over seconds, and the number of packets per connection is very low (mostly 1 or 0 packets beyond the initial). There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting high packet rates of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is not present here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these ICMP packets correspond to other suspicious activity or correlate with other logs indicating reconnaissance or scanning.  
- If a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood attack.
