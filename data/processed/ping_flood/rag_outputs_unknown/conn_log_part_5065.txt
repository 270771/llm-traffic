Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping flood activity. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP type 8 packets and monitor for high ICMP packet rates from suspicious IPs.
