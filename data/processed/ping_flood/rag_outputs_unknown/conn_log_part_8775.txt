Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack here.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in a short time frame to rule out a ping flood. Monitor for high ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests to 49.64.59.128 from 61.134.196.250.
