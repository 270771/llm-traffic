Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. A ping flood attack involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming the target. Here, the traffic shows a single ICMP Echo Reply from 107.102.62.64 to 157.206.10.79, which does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily malicious.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other ICMP Echo Request entries (type 8) with high frequency from the same or other IPs. Monitor for repeated or volumetric ICMP traffic to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
