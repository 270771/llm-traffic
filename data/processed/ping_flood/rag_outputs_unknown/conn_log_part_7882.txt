Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) typically sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) entries in the broader logs to confirm if ping flood attempts exist. Also, monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns involving these IPs (45.225.96.135 and 163.45.138.228) to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
