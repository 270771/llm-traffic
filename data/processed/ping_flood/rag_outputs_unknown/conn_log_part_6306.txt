Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 1 and 3, with only one entry showing type 13. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ping floods are present in the provided anomaly CSV or heuristic context.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as a high volume of these could indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance or scanning activity. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets would be necessary to detect a ping flood in the future.
