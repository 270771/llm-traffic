Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, primarily on ports like 5060 (SIP), 8080, and others.
- There is no indication of ICMP traffic in the logs, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP entries means no ping flood pattern is present.
- The traffic appears to be failed connection attempts (S0 state) on various ports, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.
- Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed connection attempts (S0) relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated failed connection attempts on UDP port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as this may indicate SIP scanning or an attempt to exploit VoIP services.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods in the future.
- Consider enabling deeper packet inspection or IDS rules focused on SIP and scanning behaviors.
