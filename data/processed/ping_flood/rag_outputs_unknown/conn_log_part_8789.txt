Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.29.24.223) from numerous distinct source IPs within the same timestamp. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- In absence of explicit heuristics or taxonomy from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack under ICMP flood taxonomy.  
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High volume ICMP Echo Request flood)  
- Taxonomy class: ICMP Flood / DoS Attack

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.29.24.223 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker IPs: 157.206.249.203, 157.206.122.28, 157.206.122.12, 157.206.2.176, 157.206.117.26, 157.206.244.25, 157.206.108.33, 157.206.245.141, 157.206.119.26, 157.206.244.245, 157.206.169.9, 157.206.244.72, 157.206.75.65, 157.206.49.34, 157.206.62.67, 157.206.108.80, 157.206.122.43, 157.206.12.129, 157.206.172.150, 157.206.225.233, 157.206.12.66  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers for possible source mitigation (e.g., blackholing or upstream filtering).  
4. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests to the victim host if business operations allow.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.  
6. Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
