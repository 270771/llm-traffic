Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 11, 3, and 3 respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and time exceeded (type 11) messages, which may indicate network issues or scanning but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential misconfigurations or other network anomalies. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.
