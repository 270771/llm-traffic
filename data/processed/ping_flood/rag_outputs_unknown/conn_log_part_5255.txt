Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Monitor for other TCP-based anomalies such as SYN floods or port scans, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN sent (S0) and no response, which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if such data becomes available.
