Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Monitor for other types of suspicious TCP connection attempts, as many entries show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning or connection attempts once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
