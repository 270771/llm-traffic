Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP type 8 packets would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
