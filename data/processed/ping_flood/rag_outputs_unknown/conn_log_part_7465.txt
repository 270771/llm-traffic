Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). Here, only one entry has ICMP type 8 (from 45.225.96.135 to 202.250.248.176), and it is a single connection record, not indicative of a flood. The other two entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard knowledge, a ping flood would require a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 connection for legitimacy but it does not currently indicate an attack.  
- Review network baseline traffic to detect any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests.
