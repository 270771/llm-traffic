Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is indicated by the 7th column (protocol) as "icmp," and the 4th and 6th columns appear to be ports or ICMP type/code fields. Here, the ICMP type values are 11, 11, 3, and 11 respectively. Since none of these entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages and type 3 to "Destination Unreachable," which are normal ICMP control messages, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source of repeated ICMP type 11 messages if they are unusually frequent, as they may indicate network routing issues or traceroute activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal a future ping flood attempt.
