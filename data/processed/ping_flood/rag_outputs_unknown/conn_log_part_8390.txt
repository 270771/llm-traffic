Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (indicated by the destination port field being `0` for ICMP), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection state but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the ICMP type and code fields explicitly. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 202.101.171.237 to 162.113.225.26 to detect potential ping floods.
