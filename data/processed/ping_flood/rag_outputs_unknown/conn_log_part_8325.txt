Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ICMP Echo Requests are observed, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs or timeframes with ICMP type 8 packets in high volume.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Consider checking other protocols or logs for different attack types if suspicious behavior continues.
