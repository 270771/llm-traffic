Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (echo request). Specifically, the ICMP type fields are 0, 13, 0, and 10, none of which correspond to the echo request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood (ICMP type 8) is not met, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 10 (router advertisement), 13 (timestamp request), and 0 (echo reply) traffic to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If unusual volumes of other ICMP types persist, consider applying heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance once available.
