Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 13 (timestamp request), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (echo reply). Neither is ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 94.164.54.35 sending ICMP echo replies without corresponding echo requests, which may indicate anomalous or misconfigured behavior.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from any IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
