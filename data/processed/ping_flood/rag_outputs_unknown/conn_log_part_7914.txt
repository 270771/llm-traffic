Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, not type 8 which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Request (ping). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) suggest normal or error-related ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP errors. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
