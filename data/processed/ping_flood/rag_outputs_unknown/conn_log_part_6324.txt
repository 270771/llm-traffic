Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 11, 11, and 3 respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," which are not indicative of ping floods.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based diagnostics or errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If suspicious activity continues, collect more detailed logs including ICMP payload sizes and rates for further analysis.
