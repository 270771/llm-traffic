Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 1, 128, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP types observed (1 = Destination Unreachable, 128 = Echo Reply, 0 = Echo Reply in some contexts) to determine if other ICMP-based anomalies or misconfigurations exist.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other protocols or ICMP types.
