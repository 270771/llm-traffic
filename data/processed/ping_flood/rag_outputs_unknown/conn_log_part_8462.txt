Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.196.70.79) from many distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ping traffic.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- In absence of explicit heuristics or taxonomy from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack under the taxonomy class "Network Flooding" or "Ping Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.196.70.79 (ICMP does not use ports)  
- Source IPs: Multiple distinct IPs in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.219.160, 133.243.243.72, 133.243.179.214, etc.)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.196.70.79.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.  
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.  
6. Prepare incident response to mitigate service disruption and notify affected stakeholders.
