Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 11 or other than 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages, as they may indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
