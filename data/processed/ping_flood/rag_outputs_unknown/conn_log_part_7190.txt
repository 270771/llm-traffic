Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0, 1, or other than 8 (echo request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly indicators, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with types other than 8 to ensure they are legitimate (e.g., echo replies, destination unreachable).  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) in future logs.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
