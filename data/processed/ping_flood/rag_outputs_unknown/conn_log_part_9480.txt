Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.198.197.73 from different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic patterns for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (133.227.116.155, 133.227.62.172, 133.227.202.253, 133.227.202.248, 133.227.202.247, 133.227.167.249) targeting destination IP 54.198.197.73 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms the traffic is Echo Request.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP addresses if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor the target host 54.198.197.73 for service degradation or outages.
- Investigate upstream network devices and ISP cooperation to trace and block the attack sources.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Consider applying geo-blocking or access control lists (ACLs) if the source IPs are from unexpected regions.
