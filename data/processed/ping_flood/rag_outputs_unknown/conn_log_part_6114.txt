Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, no ping flood is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found.
- The traffic shows many TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic context or anomaly taxonomy, the best classification is "No ping flood detected."

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0) for possible TCP SYN scan or DoS attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging or capture to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further insight into suspicious TCP connection patterns.
