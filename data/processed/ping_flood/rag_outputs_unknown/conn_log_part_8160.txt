Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP Echo Reply communication.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request (type 8) traffic from the involved IPs (61.134.196.250 and 43.163.219.10). If a surge in type 8 packets occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
