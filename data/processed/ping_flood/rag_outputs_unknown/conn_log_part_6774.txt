Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent rapidly from multiple source IPs (173.20.80.35, 133.227.159.60, 133.227.149.142, 133.227.212.244, 133.227.149.202, 133.227.161.48) targeting a single destination IP (35.87.78.209) and several others (163.45.129.214, 163.45.129.212, 163.45.129.193). The high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.

- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic: rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting one or more hosts. The most likely heuristic number would be "ICMP Flood Detection" (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 173.20.80.35, 133.227.159.60, 133.227.149.142, 133.227.212.244, 133.227.149.202, 133.227.161.48
  - Destinations: 35.87.78.209, 163.45.129.214, 163.45.129.212, 163.45.129.193

- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical and confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing and apply appropriate remediation.
  6. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required.
