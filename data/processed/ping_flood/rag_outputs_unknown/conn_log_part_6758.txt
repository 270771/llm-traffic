Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.227.90.79) within the same second (timestamp 1641013210.866xxx). Multiple distinct source IPs from the 133.243.x.x subnet are sending ICMP Echo Requests rapidly and concurrently, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic is:  
  **Heuristic #1: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target**  
- Taxonomy class:  
  **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attackers (sources): Multiple IPs in the 133.243.0.0/16 range (e.g., 133.243.10.178, 133.243.81.136, 133.243.172.139, etc.)  
- Victim (destination): 54.227.90.79  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.243.0.0/16) targeting 54.227.90.79.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust defenses accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if not required for legitimate operations.  
6. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
