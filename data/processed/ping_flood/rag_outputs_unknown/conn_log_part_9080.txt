Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types: 11, 8, and 0.  
- Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one record has type 8 as the source port (203.78.143.78 â†’ 85.157.253.2), but there is no indication of a high volume or rapid repetition of these packets that would suggest flooding. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 0 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- The absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high-rate traffic means no ping flood pattern is present.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to assign specific heuristic numbers or taxonomy classes. However, if this were a ping flood, the heuristic would typically relate to ICMP flood detection and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 and 0 packets if unusual patterns emerge, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Collect more detailed traffic statistics or flow data to detect subtle or emerging DoS patterns.
