Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP packets in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp Request). Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume to overwhelm a target, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The observed ICMP types (11 and 13) typically indicate diagnostic or network control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 and 13 packets to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostic activities and not part of a reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.  
- If further anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance once available.
