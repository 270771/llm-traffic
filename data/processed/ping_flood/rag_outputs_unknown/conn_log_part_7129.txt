Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that might indicate ping floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.  

Without ICMP type 8 traffic, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood applies here.
