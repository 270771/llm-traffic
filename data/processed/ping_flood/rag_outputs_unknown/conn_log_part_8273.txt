Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 1, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP type 1, it may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there are underlying network misconfigurations or other scanning activities. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
