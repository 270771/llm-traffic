Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.197.247.113 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013230.368 to 1641013230.374). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / DoS Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources from the 157.206.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.206.18.106, 157.206.9.133, 157.206.133.231, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 3.197.247.113 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 3.197.247.113 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle ICMP traffic if attack volume escalates.
  5. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 3.197.247.113.
