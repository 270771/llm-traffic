Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 corresponds to "Echo Reply," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs for any unusual volume or patterns in other logs, but no immediate ping flood response is required. If further anomalies appear, correlate with other network data to identify potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
