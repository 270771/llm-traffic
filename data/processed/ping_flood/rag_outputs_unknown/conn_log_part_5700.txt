Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type here. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network diagnostic traffic.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
