Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The traffic is coming from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013225.57), indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests flooding the target. This pattern matches the classic ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP echo requests to degrade or deny service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS systems).  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 163.84.73.84 (destination)  
- Multiple source IPs: 157.206.81.17, 157.206.11.23, 157.206.153.34, 157.206.216.249, 157.206.153.11, 133.243.77.12, 157.206.108.245, 157.206.162.250, 157.206.110.251, 157.206.149.59, 157.206.34.198, 133.243.100.239, 157.206.88.5, 133.243.253.243, 157.206.164.250, 130.187.195.250, 133.243.136.13, 133.243.255.246, 133.243.136.7, 157.206.163.19, 157.206.170.248, 133.243.100.234  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor the target host (163.84.73.84) for service degradation and apply mitigation such as ICMP traffic shaping or temporary disabling of ICMP responses if appropriate.  
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update threat intelligence feeds accordingly.
