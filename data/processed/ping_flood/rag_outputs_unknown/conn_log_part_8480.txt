Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the type used by ping.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.206.119.16, 133.243.248.251, 157.206.122.2) are sending rapid ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223).
- The timestamps are very close together (all around 1641013226.2), indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all relevant entries, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP ping flood: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests targeting one or more hosts.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (ICMP Flood Detection).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) Attack.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.119.16, 133.243.248.251, 157.206.122.2, 157.206.143.5, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223.
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to block or filter traffic from the attacking IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor affected hosts (163.84.73.84, 44.198.161.223) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required.
- Collect and preserve logs for forensic analysis and potential legal action.
