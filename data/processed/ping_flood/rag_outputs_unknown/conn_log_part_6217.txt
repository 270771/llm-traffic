Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood. The heuristic and taxonomy context is missing, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 1 messages are being generated between 133.227.8.71 and 185.167.249.147, as frequent destination unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
