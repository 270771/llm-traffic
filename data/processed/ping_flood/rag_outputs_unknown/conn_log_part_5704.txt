Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (154.137.226.93 and 202.250.216.227) for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts.
