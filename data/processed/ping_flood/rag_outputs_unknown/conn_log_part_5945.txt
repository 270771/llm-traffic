Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is not ICMP type 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), and the flags indicate no established session, which may warrant further investigation to understand the nature of this ICMP traffic, but it is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.122 and destination IP 177.92.165.147 for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other suspicious activity over a longer time window to rule out reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
