Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have a destination port of 0 and protocol "icmp," but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request). Since the condition for a ping flood requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match a ping flood pattern. The connection state "OTH" (other) and flags "F F" indicate these are likely isolated or incomplete ICMP exchanges, not a flood of echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of explicit ICMP type 8 and no anomaly flags, no immediate attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the full ICMP packet details to confirm ICMP types and rates. Monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests from these IPs (129.1.134.253 and 12.7.64.217) to the respective destinations. If a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets is observed, reassess for ping flood.
