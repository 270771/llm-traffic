Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would have protocol number 1, but the conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to various 133.105.175.x addresses on port 5060 is consistent with SIP signaling or similar, not ICMP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The UDP traffic to port 5060 may warrant investigation for SIP scanning or flooding, but it is not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 on multiple destination IPs for potential SIP-related abuse.
- Enable ICMP logging and monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Apply heuristics for UDP flood or SIP scanning if available in your detection framework.
