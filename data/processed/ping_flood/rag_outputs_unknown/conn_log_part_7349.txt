Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts for potential port scanning or brute force attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify suspicious IPs for further blocking or monitoring.
