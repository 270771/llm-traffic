Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This single ICMP Echo Reply does not indicate a flood or attack pattern. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be made. However, monitoring for multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP would be the next step to detect potential ping floods.
