Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 8, 1, and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from 133.243.214.61 to 120.74.163.52 with a single connection entry, which does not indicate flooding or high volume. The other ICMP types (1 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high-volume traffic means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate a developing ping flood.
