Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent other ICMP-based activity or benign traffic. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual ICMP traffic volume is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
