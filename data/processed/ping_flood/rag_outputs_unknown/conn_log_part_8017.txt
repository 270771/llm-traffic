Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 107.102.62.64 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013222.19xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target IP is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the target with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade or deny service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 107.102.62.64 (ICMP type 8, no ports as ICMP is layer 3)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.234.255, 157.206.100.207, 157.206.80.13, 157.206.149.174, 157.206.234.251, 157.206.247.176, 157.206.196.254, 157.206.12.66, 157.206.100.252, 157.206.247.172, 157.206.206.197, etc.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 107.102.62.64.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and identify if source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.  
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Alert the affected system owners and prepare for potential service degradation or outage.  
6. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if attack volume increases.
