Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 1 and 13, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 1 is "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 is "Timestamp Request," neither of which indicate a ping flood.
- The connection states are OTH (other), with no evidence of high packet volume or repeated echo requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no ping flood or related ICMP flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other ICMP type 8 packets in the broader logs to confirm no ping flood is occurring.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated echo requests from the involved IPs (203.78.139.211, 222.215.88.95, 163.45.185.120, 54.24.149.49) as a precaution.
