Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first two entries show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and frequency in this snippet are very low (only two such connections), insufficient to indicate flooding.  
- The third entry is ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and flags indicate no retransmissions or unusual behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. If further investigation is warranted, monitoring for a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP over a short time window would be the next step to detect potential ping floods.
