Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.34, which is an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 133.243.6.38 to 37.252.206.245, which is not a ping flood indicator. Also, the volume and frequency of ICMP echo requests in the snippet are very low (only one echo request in the given timeframe), which does not match the high-rate, repetitive ICMP echo requests characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated echo requests to the same destination.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
