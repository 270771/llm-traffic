Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given TCP connection logs, which mostly show failed connection attempts (S0 state) but no clear signs of flooding or scanning patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, TCP connection failures might relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP activity. Monitor for repeated failed TCP connection attempts that might indicate scanning or brute force attempts.
