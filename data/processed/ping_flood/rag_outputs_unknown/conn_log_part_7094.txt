Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 2 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm a target with echo requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 2 (which is "Timestamp Reply") and type 13 (which is "Timestamp Request") traffic to determine if these are part of a reconnaissance or timing-based attack.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume patterns that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to enable heuristic-based classification.
