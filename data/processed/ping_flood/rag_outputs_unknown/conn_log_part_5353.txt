Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.
- The anomaly CSV contains no records, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no alternative attack patterns can be inferred from this data.

Recommendation:
- Continue monitoring for ICMP traffic, especially type 8 packets, to detect potential ping floods.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP traffic volume in future logs.
- If suspicious TCP SYN floods or other anomalies appear, apply relevant heuristics once available.
