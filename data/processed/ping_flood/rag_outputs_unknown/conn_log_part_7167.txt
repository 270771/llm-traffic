Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

The ICMP types observed correspond to:
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable
- Type 10: Router Advertisement

These types indicate network control or error messages rather than an attack involving excessive echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP traffic and no anomalies flagged, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns. If ICMP Echo Requests surge, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate the source IPs for unusual behavior in other protocols or logs.
