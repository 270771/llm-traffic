Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the source IP, which shows the value `8` for both entries, indicating Echo Request packets (ping). However, the traffic volume and pattern do not match a ping flood. The first record shows a single ICMP packet of size 224 bytes with a duration of 13.7 seconds, and the second record has no packet or byte counts, indicating no sustained or high-rate traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs (118.188.11.6 and 172.23.68.231).  
- Investigate if these IPs generate bursts of ICMP traffic over a short time frame, which would be more indicative of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for denial-of-service symptoms.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no immediate security response is required.
