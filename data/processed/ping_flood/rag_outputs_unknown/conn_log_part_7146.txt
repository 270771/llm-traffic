Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.88 and destination 91.231.241.3 for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect possible future ping floods.
