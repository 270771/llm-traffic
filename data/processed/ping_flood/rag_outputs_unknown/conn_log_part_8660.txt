Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection states are "OTH" (other), and the packet counts are minimal (only 1 packet each). There is no evidence of high-volume or sustained ICMP traffic typical of a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious behavior.

Since no anomalies are detected and no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no attack classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate pings.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated echo requests from the same source IPs (172.23.68.231) to multiple destinations, which could indicate the start of a ping flood. Implement threshold-based alerts for ICMP packet rates if not already in place.
