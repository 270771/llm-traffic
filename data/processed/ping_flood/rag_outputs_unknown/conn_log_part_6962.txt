Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have types 1, 13, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable), 13 (Timestamp), and 0 (Echo Reply) traffic for potential other issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
