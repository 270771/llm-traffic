Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- Heuristic for ping flood would require repeated ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.140.213 and 203.78.136.82) for potential other suspicious activity, as ICMP type 11 messages can indicate traceroute or network issues but are not inherently malicious. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other DoS indicators.
