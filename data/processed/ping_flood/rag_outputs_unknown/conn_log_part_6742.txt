Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given as 8 (Echo Request). Since the first record shows ICMP code 3 and the second record code 0, neither corresponds to ICMP type 8. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 indicates ping requests relevant to ping floods. The traffic here appears to be other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable or echo reply), which do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means this is not a ping flood but possibly normal or other ICMP diagnostic traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 messages (often destination unreachable) to ensure no network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
