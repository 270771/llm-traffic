Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- The connections show SYN packets with no successful handshake (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the observed traffic aligns with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than flooding.
- Typical heuristic for scanning would be repeated SYN attempts without completion (S0), classified under reconnaissance or scanning taxonomy.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.153, 89.247.69.180) for potential scanning or probing.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further suspicious activity.
