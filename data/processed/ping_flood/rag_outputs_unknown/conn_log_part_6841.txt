Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting many different destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013211.52). All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The high volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection heuristic (commonly heuristic #3 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Flooding").  
- The taxonomy class is "Network DoS Attack" or "Volumetric ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 54.236.220.60  
- Multiple destination IPs: 163.45.253.133, 163.45.253.202, 163.45.99.176, 163.45.21.43, 163.45.188.171, 163.45.188.250, 163.45.8.51, 163.45.129.205, 163.45.120.66, 163.45.91.242  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.236.220.60 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact on targeted hosts.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.  
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, allowing only legitimate diagnostic pings.
