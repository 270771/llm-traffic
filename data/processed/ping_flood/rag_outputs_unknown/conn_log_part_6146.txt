Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as ping floods rely on ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets in future logs.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP anomalies.
- Continue monitoring TCP/UDP traffic for other attack types such as SYN floods or UDP floods, as many TCP entries show SYN packets (S0 state) but no clear flooding pattern here.
