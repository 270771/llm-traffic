Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 1, and 10. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type used in ping floods.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, type 1 is an ICMP Host Unreachable or similar error, and type 10 is a Router Advertisement. These do not correspond to ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP error messages (type 3 and 1) could be useful to investigate potential network issues or misconfigurations. Further investigation could include:  
- Correlating these ICMP error messages with network device logs to identify possible routing or connectivity problems.  
- Checking for unusual volumes or patterns of ICMP error messages that might indicate reconnaissance or misconfigured hosts.
