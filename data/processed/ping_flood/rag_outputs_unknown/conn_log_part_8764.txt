Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 1, 1, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm the target with echo requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the presence of ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable) and 0 (Echo Reply) suggests normal or error-related ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 1 messages (203.78.137.66) to understand if there are underlying network issues causing unreachable destinations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.  
- If unusual volumes of ICMP type 1 or 0 persist, consider deeper packet inspection or correlation with other logs to rule out reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
