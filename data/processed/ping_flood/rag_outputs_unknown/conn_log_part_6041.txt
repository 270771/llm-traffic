Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the single ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 218.73.175.208 to destination 133.105.146.185 with only 1 packet and 28 bytes, which is insufficient volume or frequency to indicate a flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high volume traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if ICMP type 3 or 11 messages indicate other network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP-based reconnaissance.
