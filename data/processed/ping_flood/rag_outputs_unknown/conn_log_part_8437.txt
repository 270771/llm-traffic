Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, also not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No high volume or repetitive ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet.  

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match other common attack patterns based on the given data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IPs, especially if sustained and high volume.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 sending Echo Replies without corresponding Echo Requests in the snippet, to rule out any irregular ICMP behavior.
