Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (indicated by the source port field as 0), not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection record. Without anomaly data or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns of repeated ICMP Echo Requests.
