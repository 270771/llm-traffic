Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.115.89, 133.243.77.0, 133.243.156.125, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP 35.72.129.52 in a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013236.19xxxx).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single IP is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: DoS/Disruption.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (destination of all ICMP Echo Requests).
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.115.89, 133.243.77.0, 133.243.156.125, 133.243.229.92, 133.243.125.147, 133.243.171.99, 133.243.77.215, 133.243.125.182, 133.243.146.13, 133.243.146.230, 133.243.115.213, 133.243.115.84.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 35.72.129.52.
- Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential spoofing or compromise; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- If possible, engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic before it reaches the network.
- Ensure the target host 35.72.129.52 is hardened against DoS attacks and has appropriate logging enabled for forensic analysis.
