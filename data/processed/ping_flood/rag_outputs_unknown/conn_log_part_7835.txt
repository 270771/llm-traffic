Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, there are only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.23 and 133.105.230.19). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without a pattern of repeated or volumetric ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from this or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.  
- If a sudden spike in ICMP Echo Requests occurs, apply heuristics related to volumetric ICMP traffic and classify under taxonomy class "Denial of Service" or "Network Flooding."

Currently, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies due to lack of anomaly data and low traffic volume.
