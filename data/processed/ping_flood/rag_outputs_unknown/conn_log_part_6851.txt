Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x subnet. The rapid succession of these echo requests with very short intervals (~0.007 to 0.009 seconds) matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target network with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic classifications for volumetric ICMP flood attacks, typically assigned heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood) and taxonomy class "Network DoS" or "Volumetric Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.236.220.60; multiple victim IPs include 163.45.49.2, 163.45.196.16, 163.45.94.110, 163.45.134.18, 163.45.66.120, 163.45.213.29, 163.45.223.245, 163.45.5.57, 163.45.49.151, 163.45.1.136, 163.45.124.193, 163.45.216.251, 163.45.100.9, 163.45.49.10, 163.45.22.190, 163.45.11.78, 163.45.159.87, 163.45.147.254, 163.45.177.128, 163.45.223.90. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from 54.236.220.60.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or filtering attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor network performance and logs for signs of collateral impact or secondary attacks.
  5. Consider blacklisting the attacker IP temporarily and investigate if this IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host network.
