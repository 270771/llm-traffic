Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there is ICMP echo reply traffic without corresponding echo requests, as this could indicate misconfiguration or other network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the source IP 218.124.27.15 to 133.105.224.147 to detect potential future ping floods.
