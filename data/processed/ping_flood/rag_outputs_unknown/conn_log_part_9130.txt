Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code column (field 4) with a value of 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network issues or scanning activity and could warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages from the source IP 163.45.0.118 to destination 134.210.239.174, as excessive unreachable messages may indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance attempts.
