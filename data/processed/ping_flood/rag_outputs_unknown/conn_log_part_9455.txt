Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP connections from 45.121.95.154 to various destination IPs on port 5060, but these are UDP packets, not ICMP.
- There is no indication of ICMP traffic in the logs, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern appears to be many short-lived UDP connection attempts (S0 state), possibly scanning or failed attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic is triggered.
- The observed UDP traffic could be related to SIP or VoIP scanning (port 5060 is commonly SIP), which may warrant further investigation.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IP 45.121.95.154 for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity targeting UDP port 5060.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) floods in future logs to detect ping flood attacks.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to better identify potential ICMP-based attacks.
