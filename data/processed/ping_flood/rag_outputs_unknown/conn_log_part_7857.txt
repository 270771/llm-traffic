Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type values 1, 8, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there are two entries with ICMP type 8, but the counts of packets are very low (1 and 0 packets in the respective entries), and the connection states are OTH (other), indicating no sustained or repeated traffic typical of a flood. There is no evidence of high-volume or rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard definitions:  
- Heuristic: Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from one source to a target within a short time frame.  
- Taxonomy: ICMP Flood / Denial of Service.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or changes in connection states indicating sustained sessions.  
- Enable alerting on thresholds of ICMP Echo Requests per source IP to detect early signs of flooding.
