Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single packet with no indication of flooding or high volume. There is no evidence of repeated or excessive ICMP Echo Requests from one source to a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic typically relates to network diagnostics or routing issues, not attacks.

Next steps:  
Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods. If such patterns emerge, investigate source IP behavior and consider rate limiting or blocking.
