Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are mostly 3, 11, and 8. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is necessary for a ping flood. However, this single echo request from 203.78.143.78 to 89.180.55.1 does not indicate flooding, as there is no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source IP. The other ICMP types (3 = destination unreachable, 11 = time exceeded) are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The lack of multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession means no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency. Investigate the single ICMP echo request if it correlates with other suspicious activity, but currently no attack is detected.
