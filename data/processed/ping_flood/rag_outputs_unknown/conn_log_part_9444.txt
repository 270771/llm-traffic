Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP (3.199.185.249) from different source IPs (157.206.163.17, 157.206.194.81, 157.206.242.129) within a very short time frame. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses: Sources - 157.206.163.17, 157.206.194.81, 157.206.242.129; Destination - 3.199.185.249; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs for potential amplification or coordinated attacks.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
  5. Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
