Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013225.59). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP ping flood: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources including 157.206.119.26, 157.206.210.220, 157.206.225.2, 133.243.19.232, 133.243.90.5, 133.243.252.195, 157.206.109.4, 157.206.63.1, 133.243.9.1, 133.243.100.232, 157.206.195.224, 157.206.160.220 all targeting 163.84.73.84 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 163.84.73.84.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or follow-on attacks.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as traffic scrubbing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
