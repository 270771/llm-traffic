Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is an ICMP Echo Reply, it may be part of normal network communication or a response to a previous ping.

No attack is present. Further investigation could include monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 172.23.68.231 or to the destination 202.250.220.193 to detect potential ping floods.
