Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is indicated by the field with value `3` (the 4th field after the timestamp and UID), which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network issues or scanning activity and could warrant further investigation.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages from the source IP 203.78.140.235 to the destination 104.201.127.230 to determine if this is part of a larger reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.
