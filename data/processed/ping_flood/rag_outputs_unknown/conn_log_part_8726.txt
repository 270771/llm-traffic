Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has ICMP type 128 (indicated by the Zeek conn.log ICMP code field), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns, no attack is indicated.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request floods (type 8) or unusually high ICMP traffic volume. Investigate if other ICMP types show abnormal frequency or if other logs indicate different attack vectors.
