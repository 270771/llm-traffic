Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are routing or firewall issues or if this is part of a different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempt. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
