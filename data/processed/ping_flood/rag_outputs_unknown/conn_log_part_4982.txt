Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.* range) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance.  
- Enable ICMP logging or capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of anomaly data and context.
