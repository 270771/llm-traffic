Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are two isolated connections with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The other ICMP entries have types other than 8, which do not qualify as ping floods. There is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Request traffic typical of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP traffic appears normal or unrelated to ping flood attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with network flow data or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP anomalies.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests if they appear in future logs.
