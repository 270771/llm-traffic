Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 4th column (after source IP and before destination IP). For ping requests (ICMP Echo Request), the type must be 8.  
- Only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - `172.23.68.231 -> 163.45.23.56` (type 8)  
  - `94.150.184.221 -> 203.78.135.92` (type 8)  
- However, these entries do not show characteristics of a flood: the number of packets (`id.orig_p` and `id.resp_p` fields) and durations are minimal, and there is no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are not ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if unusual volumes are detected, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic definitions to improve detection accuracy.
