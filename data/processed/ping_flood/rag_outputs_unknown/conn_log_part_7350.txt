Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have types 0, 1, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types:  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  
- Type 1: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  

These do not indicate a ping flood but could be part of normal network diagnostics or other ICMP-related activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual ICMP behavior or other suspicious activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other signs of volumetric attacks.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to rule out different attack vectors.
