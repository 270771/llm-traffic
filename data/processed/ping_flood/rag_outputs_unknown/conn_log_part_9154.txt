Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating the connection did not complete normally, but this alone is insufficient to indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP in a short time frame to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Also, monitor for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that may indicate different network anomalies.
