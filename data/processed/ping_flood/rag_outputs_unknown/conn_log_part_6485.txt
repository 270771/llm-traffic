Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 0, 13, and 0 respectively. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood. ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts promptly.
