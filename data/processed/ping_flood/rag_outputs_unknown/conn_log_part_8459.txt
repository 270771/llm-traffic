Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means the traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. However, the lack of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood, and the TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitoring for repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs and correlating with firewall or IDS logs is recommended. Establish heuristics for SYN scan detection and assign taxonomy accordingly once more data is available.
