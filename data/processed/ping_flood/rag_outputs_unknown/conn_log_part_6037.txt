Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (e.g., icmp.log) to check for ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated connection attempts that might indicate other attack types.
- Enable or review anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to catch ping floods in future monitoring.
