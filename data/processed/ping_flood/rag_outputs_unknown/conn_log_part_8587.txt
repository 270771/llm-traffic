Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP packets and no suspicious anomaly records, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are legitimate network control traffic and not indicative of misconfiguration or other network issues. Monitoring for any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets is recommended.
