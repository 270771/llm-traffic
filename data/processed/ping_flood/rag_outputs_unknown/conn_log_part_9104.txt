Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows a connection with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.51.195 and destination IP 178.81.41.201 for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues, but no immediate attack response is warranted.
