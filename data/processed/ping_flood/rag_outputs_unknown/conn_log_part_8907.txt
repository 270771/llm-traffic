Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 13 packets from 133.227.58.120 to 92.72.197.107 to rule out potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based anomalies. Also, monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
