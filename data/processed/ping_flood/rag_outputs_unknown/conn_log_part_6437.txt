Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP type 8 or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic volume from these IPs.  
- If other ICMP types are involved, consider if they relate to other ICMP-based attacks or network issues.
