Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a flood. The logs show only two distinct ICMP connections from different source IPs to the same destination IP, each with a single packet (`-` in packet count fields and `1` in the last field likely indicating one packet). This is insufficient to classify as a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 8 is present but no flood pattern is detected, no ping flood attack is occurring.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from the same or multiple sources to the target IP.  
- Investigate if other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge.  
- If anomalies appear, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving thresholds on packet rate and volume.
