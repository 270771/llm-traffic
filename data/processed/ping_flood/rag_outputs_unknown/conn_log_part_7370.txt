Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there is only a single ICMP Echo Request recorded, not a flood or high volume of such packets. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods. No repeated or excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination are present to indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks. Also, consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on abnormal ICMP traffic volumes.
