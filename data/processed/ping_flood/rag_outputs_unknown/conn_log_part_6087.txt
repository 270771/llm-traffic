Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 47, 1, and 13. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Type 47 is "NI Query" (Node Information Query)  
- Type 1 is "Destination Unreachable"  
- Type 13 is "Timestamp Request"  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, if these ICMP types were to be considered suspicious, they would fall outside the typical ping flood classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP type 1 or 13 traffic, as these could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to better classify and respond to ICMP anomalies.
