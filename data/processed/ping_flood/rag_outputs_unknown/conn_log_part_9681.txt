Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would be identified by protocol number 1 (ICMP), but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to confirm a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.220.x addresses on port 5060 appears to be SIP signaling or similar, not ICMP.
- The TCP connections show SYN attempts (S0 state) but no flooding pattern consistent with ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 for potential SIP flooding or UDP-based DoS.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect ping floods.
- Consider enabling deeper packet inspection or flow analysis to identify other attack types.
