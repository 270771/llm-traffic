Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets originating from a single source IP (173.20.80.38) targeting multiple destination IPs (163.45.128.76, 163.45.128.78, 163.45.128.82, 163.45.128.84, 163.45.128.85) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations.
- The rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests within milliseconds strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to consume bandwidth or processing resources.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 173.20.80.38; Destination IPs 163.45.128.76, 163.45.128.78, 163.45.128.82, 163.45.128.84, 163.45.128.85; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 173.20.80.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DoS protection features on network devices.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
