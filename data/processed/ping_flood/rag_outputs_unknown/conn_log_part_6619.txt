Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, also not an echo request. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 packets and no anomaly flags, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP type 3 and 0 messages are present; these could indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
