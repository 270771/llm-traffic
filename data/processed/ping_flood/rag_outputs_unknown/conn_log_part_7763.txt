Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods. However, the traffic volume is very lowâ€”only two ICMP type 8 entries from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to different destination IPs, each with a single connection record. This does not match the high-rate, repetitive ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of a ping flood attack.

The ICMP type 3 entry (from 203.78.139.178 to 192.0.222.29) is a Destination Unreachable message, unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations within a short time frame.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs or network sensors report unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Confirm that no other types of ICMP-based attacks (e.g., ICMP Smurf, ICMP Redirect) are occurring by analyzing additional ICMP types and traffic patterns.
