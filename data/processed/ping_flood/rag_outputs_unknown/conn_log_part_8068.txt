Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent rapidly to the same destination IP 47.201.192.242 from different source IPs (157.206.141.186, 133.243.68.207, 133.243.201.73, 157.206.101.9). This pattern of multiple echo requests in a short time frame matches known ping flood behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.206.141.186, 133.243.68.207, 133.243.201.73, 157.206.101.9; Destination - 47.201.192.242; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor the target host 47.201.192.242 for service degradation and consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP filtering policies to prevent further impact.
