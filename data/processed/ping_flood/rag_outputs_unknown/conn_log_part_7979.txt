Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 202.204.40.248 to 107.102.62.64 with ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard taxonomy, this traffic does not indicate a denial-of-service or flooding attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are ICMP Echo Replies without corresponding Echo Requests in the logs; this could indicate asymmetric logging or missing data.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review network device logs for any signs of ICMP-based reconnaissance or other ICMP misuse.
