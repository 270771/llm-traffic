Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) and therefore not a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8. Ping floods require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).  
- No anomalies or heuristics are provided, and no evidence of excessive ICMP Echo Requests or rapid repeated pings is present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic volume spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify patterns of suspicious ICMP traffic.
