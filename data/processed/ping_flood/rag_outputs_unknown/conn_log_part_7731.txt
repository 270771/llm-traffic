Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.113 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such event recorded, not a flood or high volume of echo requests. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would require multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a destination, which is not evident here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If a pattern of repeated echo requests emerges, investigate for potential ICMP flood. For now, no security incident is indicated.
