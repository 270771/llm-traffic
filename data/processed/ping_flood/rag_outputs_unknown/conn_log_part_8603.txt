Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from 203.106.198.164 to 133.251.118.110, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics require detection of a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to a target, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate other ICMP types (like type 11) if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as they may indicate other network issues or attacks such as traceroute abuse or routing problems.
