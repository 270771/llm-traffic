Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (last numeric field before the dash), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 203.145.55.236 and 158.133.112.240 to determine if it is part of another ICMP-based activity or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
