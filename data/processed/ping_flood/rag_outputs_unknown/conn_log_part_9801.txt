Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 17 (UDP) or TCP/UDP protocols; there are no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets present.
- The traffic mostly consists of UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connection attempts with SYN flags, none matching the ICMP Echo Request pattern required for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are observed, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) is not met.
- The taxonomy class for ping flood would be "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood," but this is not applicable here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs, as this could indicate SIP scanning or a UDP flood attack.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request spikes or other suspicious ICMP types.
- Enable deeper packet inspection or IDS rules focused on SIP and UDP flood detection.
