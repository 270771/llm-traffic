Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a type field of 3 (indicated by the "3" after the source IP), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP type 3 messages could be considered if network issues arise.
