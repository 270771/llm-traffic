Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values observed are 0, 1, 10, and 11, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood is the presence of numerous ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP types present (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded) to determine if other network issues or attacks (such as network scanning or misconfigurations) are occurring.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
