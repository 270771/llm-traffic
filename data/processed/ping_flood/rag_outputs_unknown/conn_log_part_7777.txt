Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.91, but it is a single event, not a flood or high-volume pattern. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious patterns or taxonomy classes are identified. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source(s).  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if repeated ICMP Echo Requests are observed.  
- Collect heuristic data to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
