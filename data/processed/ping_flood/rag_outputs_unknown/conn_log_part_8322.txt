Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes are available from the anomaly CSV or heuristic context. Given the absence of ICMP traffic and anomalies, no heuristic applies here.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP echo requests or other ICMP types.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
