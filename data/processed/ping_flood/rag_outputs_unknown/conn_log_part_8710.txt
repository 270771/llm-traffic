Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP traffic and no anomalies, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 51.37.150.152 and destination IP 133.105.216.59 for any other suspicious activity or traffic patterns, especially if multiple similar entries appear over time. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be critical to detect a potential ping flood.
