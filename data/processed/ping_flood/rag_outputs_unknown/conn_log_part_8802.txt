Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 109.147.209.198 and destination IP 203.78.177.170 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP Time Exceeded messages, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
