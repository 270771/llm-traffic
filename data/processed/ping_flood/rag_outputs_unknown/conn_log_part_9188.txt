Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are considered for ping flood detection, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 0 corresponds to Echo Reply, which is normal response traffic rather than an attack.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. However, further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.143.78 to the destination 117.14.71.5 to detect potential future ping floods.
