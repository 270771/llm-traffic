Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.29.24.223, within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013228.83 to 1641013228.84). This pattern of many distinct source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.29.24.223 (ICMP type 8 target)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.141.11, 157.206.115.3, 157.206.115.166, 157.206.59.152, 157.206.121.228, 157.206.245.128, 157.206.51.175, 157.206.80.20, 157.206.113.76, 157.206.249.220, 157.206.207.45, 157.206.112.139, 157.206.160.220, 157.206.66.253, 157.206.112.156, 157.206.133.120, 157.206.117.62, 157.206.72.168, 157.206.77.70, 157.206.34.198, 157.206.197.174.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.29.24.223.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP traffic patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are confirmed malicious.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust mitigation accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce impact.  
6. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are spoofed or compromised hosts.
