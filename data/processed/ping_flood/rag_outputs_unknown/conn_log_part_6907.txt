Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 13 (Timestamp). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. The observed ICMP types correspond to diagnostic or error messages rather than flooding behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a broader network scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Collect additional logs or anomaly data to correlate with these ICMP error messages for potential indirect attack vectors.
