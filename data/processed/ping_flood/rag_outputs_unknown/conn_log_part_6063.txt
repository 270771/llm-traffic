Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connections but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Time Exceeded messages are being generated from 94.169.253.247 to 203.78.143.78, as this could indicate routing or TTL issues rather than an attack. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
