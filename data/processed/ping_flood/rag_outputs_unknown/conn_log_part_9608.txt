Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP packets, none matching ICMP ping flood characteristics.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154 to multiple targets, which could indicate SIP scanning or a UDP flood.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture and analyze ICMP Echo Requests if ping flood detection is a priority.
