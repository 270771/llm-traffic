Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 could indicate network issues or scanning activity, and ICMP type 0 is a normal echo reply.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.16 sending ICMP type 3 messages to 75.82.2.124 for potential network misconfigurations or scanning behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible future ping floods.
