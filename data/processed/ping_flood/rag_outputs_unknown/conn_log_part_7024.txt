Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (indicated by the field with value "1" after the destination IP), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is "OTH" (other), indicating an atypical or incomplete connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.158.250 and destination IP 58.40.254.20 for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues, as frequent ICMP type 1 messages can indicate network problems or scanning activity. Further monitoring of ICMP traffic with type 8 should be conducted to detect any future ping flood attempts.
