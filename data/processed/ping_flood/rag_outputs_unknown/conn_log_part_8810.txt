Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is indicated by the destination port field as `0`, which corresponds to ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to verify ICMP types and rates. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential ping floods.
