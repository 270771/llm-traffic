Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is observable.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP anomalies.
- Continue monitoring TCP SYN flood attempts, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or other attacks but not ping floods.
