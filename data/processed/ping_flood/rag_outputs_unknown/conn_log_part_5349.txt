Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and none are shown, no ping flood traffic is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given logs. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful completions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, TCP SYN scans would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, or reviewing logs that include ICMP type fields to detect potential ping floods. Also, monitor for repeated SYN attempts that may indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activity.
