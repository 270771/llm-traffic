Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (all in the 133.243.x.x range) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (54.227.90.79) within the same second (timestamp 1641013210.86). This pattern of many hosts simultaneously sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host," which is commonly classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 133.243.246.249, 133.243.111.130, 133.243.180.233, etc., all targeting destination IP 54.227.90.79 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.227.90.79.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to apply traffic filtering or blackholing if the attack volume is large.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and coordinate with their network operators for remediation.
