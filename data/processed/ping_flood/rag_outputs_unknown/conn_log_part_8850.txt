Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic could indicate traceroute or network path issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.136.185 and destination IPs 66.104.113.92 and 66.104.113.84 for potential network misconfigurations or routing loops causing excessive ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
