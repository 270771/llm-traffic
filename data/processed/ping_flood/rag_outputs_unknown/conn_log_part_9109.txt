Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from 133.243.189.160 to 104.121.253.248, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic. The other ICMP entries have types 1 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not represent ping floods. There is no evidence of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests or rapid repeated pings typical of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) may indicate network issues or scanning but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency. Investigate the source IP 133.243.189.160 if it begins sending multiple Echo Requests rapidly, as that could indicate the start of a ping flood. Also, review network device logs for any unusual ICMP error messages (types 1 and 3) to rule out other network anomalies.
