Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 0 (indicated by the ICMP code field being 0 and no explicit type 8 in the logs), which corresponds to Echo Reply, not Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of ICMP Echo Requests, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.177 and 202.250.230.253) for other suspicious activity or different attack vectors, as the current ICMP traffic appears benign. Monitoring for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates or other protocol anomalies is recommended.
