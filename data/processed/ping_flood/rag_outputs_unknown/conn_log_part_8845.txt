Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (indicated by the port field for ICMP being `0`), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood or other specific attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify the ICMP type and payload. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from the source IP 133.227.58.122 to the destination 103.128.244.253.
