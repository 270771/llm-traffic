Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 44.202.250.29.
- These requests originate from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target IP matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP flood heuristic, typically labeled as:
  - Heuristic: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination.
  - Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 44.202.250.29 (destination)
- Source IPs: 130.187.3.74, 130.187.49.1, 130.187.28.5, 130.187.28.58, 130.187.49.50, 130.187.239.3, 130.187.37.34
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.250.29.
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blocking or blacklisting if confirmed malicious.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
