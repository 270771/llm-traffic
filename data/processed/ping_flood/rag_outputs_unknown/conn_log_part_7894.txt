Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs (130.187.192.12 and 130.187.192.50) to the same destination (44.202.250.29) with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and there is no evidence of sustained or overwhelming traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood is detected, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs to the destination. If a surge in ICMP traffic is observed, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Additionally, verify if these isolated pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
