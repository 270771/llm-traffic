Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.196.70.79, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013226.09xxxx). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources flooding one target—is a classic indicator of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 54.196.70.79 (ICMP type 8, no ports for ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.113.63, 133.243.170.238, 157.206.152.29, 133.243.89.143, 133.243.89.163, 133.243.192.73, and many others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.196.70.79.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust defenses accordingly.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts among the source IPs and remediate accordingly.
