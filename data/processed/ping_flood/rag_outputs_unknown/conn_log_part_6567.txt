Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from the first log entry (ICMP type = 8). However, there is only a single such connection recorded with 192 packets over ~8.4 seconds, which does not indicate a flood pattern (high volume, rapid repeated requests). The other ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics require sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), which is not observed here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 203.78.143.78 to 73.58.141.50. Investigate the source IP if the volume spikes or if other suspicious activity is detected.
