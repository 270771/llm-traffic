Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1, which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or network issue causing these responses. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
