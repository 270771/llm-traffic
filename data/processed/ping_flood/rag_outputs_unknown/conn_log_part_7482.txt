Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0, 1, and 3, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages, as these may indicate network issues or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts unrelated to ping floods.
