Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has no explicit ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet, but the presence of "-" in ICMP-specific fields and the connection state "OTH" (other) indicates this is not a standard ICMP echo request (type 8) traffic. Without ICMP type 8, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection appears to be a single ICMP packet or a non-echo request type, which does not match ping flood patterns characterized by high-volume ICMP echo requests.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source IP to the destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
