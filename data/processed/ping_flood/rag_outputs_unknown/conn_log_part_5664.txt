Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in other logs or a high volume of ICMP traffic overall to rule out other ICMP-based attacks. Monitor the source IP 45.225.96.135 and destination 133.105.43.254 for unusual traffic patterns.
