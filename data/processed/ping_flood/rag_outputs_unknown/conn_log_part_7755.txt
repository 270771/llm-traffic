Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- The single ICMP type 8 entry (second line) shows one packet from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.68, which is insufficient volume or frequency to indicate flooding.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears normal or unrelated to flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs or anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
