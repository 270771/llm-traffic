Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 0, 3, and 13. Since a ping flood attack requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume to overwhelm a target, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, there is no evidence of a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) traffic to ensure they are legitimate and not part of reconnaissance or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would warrant immediate review for potential ping flood activity.
