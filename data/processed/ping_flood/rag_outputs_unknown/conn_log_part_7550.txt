Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the network for ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm the absence of ICMP floods. Also, monitor for SYN flood or scanning activity given the high number of SYN-only TCP connections (S0), which may indicate other types of reconnaissance or DoS attempts.
