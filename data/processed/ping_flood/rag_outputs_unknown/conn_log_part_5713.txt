Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal ICMP error messages rather than attack traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed ICMP traffic appears to be legitimate network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages if they are unusually frequent or correlated with network issues, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is evident.
