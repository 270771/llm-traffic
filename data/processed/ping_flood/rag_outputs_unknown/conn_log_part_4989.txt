Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood, which is typically classified under ICMP-based DoS attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or analyzing ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as the current logs show many failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.
