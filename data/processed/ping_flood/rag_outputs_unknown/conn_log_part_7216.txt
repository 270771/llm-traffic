Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" in the source port column (which for ICMP is often used to represent the ICMP type). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets being sent in high volume.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is "OTH" (other), and the flags indicate no established session or data transfer, further reducing suspicion of an ongoing attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs to detect potential ping floods early.
