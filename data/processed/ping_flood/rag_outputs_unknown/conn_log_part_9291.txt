Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.137.66 and destination IP 72.85.85.46 for other suspicious activity or anomalies in other logs, focusing on ICMP type 1 messages which may indicate network issues or scanning activity.
