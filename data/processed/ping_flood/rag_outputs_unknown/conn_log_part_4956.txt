Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes related to ping floods or other attacks are found in the provided data.

Next Steps:  
Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks. Also, review firewall or IDS alerts for unusual ICMP patterns. Monitoring TCP connection attempts for SYN floods or other TCP-based DoS attacks may be warranted given the many S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags in the logs.
