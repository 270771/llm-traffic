Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition. The traffic appears to be numerous TCP connection attempts with SYN flags set (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) as this may indicate a TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning or connection attempts (commonly heuristic #1 for scanning in many taxonomies).  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
