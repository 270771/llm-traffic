Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack types. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion for possible TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with other logs or ICMP traffic to confirm if any other attack types are present.
