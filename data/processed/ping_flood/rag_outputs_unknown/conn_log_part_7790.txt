Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 3, 13, and 0, which correspond to Destination Unreachable, Timestamp Request, and Echo Reply respectively. Since a ping flood attack requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp Request) could warrant further investigation to understand network issues or reconnaissance activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 13 messages for possible misconfigurations or scanning behavior.  
- Establish heuristics to flag unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) for early detection of ping floods.
