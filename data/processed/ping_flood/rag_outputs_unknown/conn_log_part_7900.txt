Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some successful UDP queries (SF state), but none match typical flooding or scanning patterns with ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS" (Denial of Service) would apply to ping floods, but these do not apply here.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests. Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods. Also, review other protocol logs for signs of scanning or other DoS attacks.
