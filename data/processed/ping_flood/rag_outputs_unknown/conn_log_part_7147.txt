Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP types 8, 11, and 8 respectively. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is necessary for a ping flood, but the volume and pattern here do not indicate flooding. The entries show single or very low counts (last field is 1), no rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, and no sustained high traffic typical of a ping flood. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard knowledge, a ping flood would require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated OTH (other) connection states.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
