Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 11, but none with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," both of which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV and no heuristic context is provided, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here. The traffic observed is likely normal ICMP error or diagnostic messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or unusual volume of ICMP traffic that could indicate an emerging ping flood attack.
