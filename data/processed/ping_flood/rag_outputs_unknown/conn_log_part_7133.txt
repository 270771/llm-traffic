Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP types 3 and 11 typically indicate network issues or scanning rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 3 or 11 messages that could indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
