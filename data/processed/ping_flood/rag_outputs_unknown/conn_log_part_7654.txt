Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a flood. There are only two ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs to different destinations, with no evidence of rapid, repeated requests from a single source targeting one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP Echo Requests from single sources to single destinations. If a surge is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify abnormal ICMP patterns.
