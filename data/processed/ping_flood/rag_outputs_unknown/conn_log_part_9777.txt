Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic shows multiple failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, but none match the pattern of an ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The observed traffic may indicate scanning or reconnaissance attempts (multiple failed TCP connection attempts), which typically fall under heuristics related to network scanning or brute force.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the repeated TCP connection attempts (S0 state) from IPs such as 45.121.95.154 and others for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Review firewall and IDS rules to detect and alert on ICMP Echo Request floods specifically.
