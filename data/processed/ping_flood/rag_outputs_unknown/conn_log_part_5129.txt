Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack types are clearly indicated by the provided logs. The connections mostly show SYN attempts (S0 state) without successful handshakes, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic for ping flood would involve detection of high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a source IP to a target IP.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for unusual high-rate ICMP traffic in future logs.  
- Analyze TCP SYN flood or scanning patterns separately if suspicious connection attempts persist.
