Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first entry (type 11) corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and the second entry (type 3) corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, which are normal ICMP control messages and not indicative of flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, these ICMP types are often part of normal network diagnostics or error reporting.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
