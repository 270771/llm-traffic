Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm the presence or absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for other types of suspicious TCP connection attempts, as many entries show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity. This could be investigated under heuristics related to port scanning or connection attempts.
