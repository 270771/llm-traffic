Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (44.202.250.29) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013221.09xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack under the taxonomy class "Network Flooding" or "Ping Flood."  
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (High volume ICMP Echo Request flood)  
- Taxonomy class: Network Flooding / DoS Attack

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Victim IP: 44.202.250.29 (destination)  
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources including 130.187.232.235, 130.187.239.196, 130.187.239.204, 130.187.3.93, 130.187.19.118, and many others.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 44.202.250.29.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from identified attacker IP ranges if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust firewall/ACL rules accordingly.  
5. Consider isolating the victim host or redirecting traffic to a scrubbing service if the attack volume escalates.
