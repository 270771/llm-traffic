Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request) from 100.68.218.189 to 203.78.135.92, which is a valid ping request. However, there is only a single packet with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore not related to ping flood attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or volume consistent with flooding.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. Generally, ping flood attacks fall under ICMP flood DoS heuristics, which require multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 100.68.218.189 is repeatedly sending echo requests over a short time frame.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for potential denial-of-service symptoms.
