Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP connections are targeting the same destination IP 18.46.170.245 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping requests.
- The volume and frequency of these ICMP Echo Requests from diverse source IPs (e.g., 133.227.180.249, 133.227.149.129, 133.227.149.232, etc.) within a very short time frame strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood.
- The presence of many OTH (other) connection states with zero bytes transferred but repeated ICMP Echo Requests aligns with typical ping flood behavior, where the attacker overwhelms the target with ICMP Echo Requests without expecting replies.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.
- Taxonomy class: **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 18.46.170.245 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.180.249, 133.227.149.129, 133.227.149.232, 133.227.137.194, 133.227.159.50, 133.227.183.247, 133.227.29.32, 133.227.221.6, 133.227.244.249, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 18.46.170.245.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from identified attacking IP ranges.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and adjust firewall/IDS rules accordingly.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host to reduce attack surface.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve network resilience.
