Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 52.222.245.10.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The connections occur within a very narrow time window (timestamps all around 1641013221.8), indicating a high volume of ping requests in a short period.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.149.219, 133.227.7.116, 133.227.117.63, etc.) are sending these ICMP Echo Requests to a single target, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this pattern aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 52.222.245.10 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.149.219, 133.227.7.116, 133.227.117.63, 133.227.62.174, 133.227.62.172, 133.227.7.106, 133.227.149.147, 133.227.205.7, 133.227.117.244, 133.227.205.2, 133.227.205.11, 133.227.144.251, 133.227.162.178, 133.227.226.1, 133.227.149.218.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and block additional malicious sources.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering attack traffic.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to other DoS vectors.
