Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.197.32.252) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013229.8). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in the 133.227.x.x range (e.g., 133.227.182.244, 133.227.182.253, 133.227.182.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.197.32.252 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.197.32.252.
  2. Identify and isolate compromised or misconfigured hosts in the 133.227.x.x subnet that are sending excessive ICMP traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage on the targeted host.
