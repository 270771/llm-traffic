Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and pattern shown in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs to the same destination IP, with no indication of rapid or sustained flooding. There is no evidence of excessive packet rates or overwhelming traffic typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific classification.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity. Additionally, investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
