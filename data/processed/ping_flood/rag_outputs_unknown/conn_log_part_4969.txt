Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood. The logs show connection attempts with TCP flags mostly indicating SYN scans or connection failures (S0 state), but no ICMP traffic is present.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic pattern resembles scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 states for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Correlate with other logs capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods. Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ping flood attempts.
