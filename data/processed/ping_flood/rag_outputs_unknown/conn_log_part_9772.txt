Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 19, which is not type 8 either.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required for a ping flood detection.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 11 and 19 packets may indicate other network conditions such as routing issues or other ICMP signaling, which are not attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs (203.78.136.177, 185.194.205.13, 145.66.191.248, 202.250.197.53) for unusual ICMP activity patterns over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential related network issues.
