Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs (133.243.75.79 and 133.243.75.87) to the same destination (173.20.80.38) with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and the counts are minimal (1 packet each), which does not match the pattern of a ping flood characterized by a large number of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming the target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Without evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to the destination IP.  
- Investigate if these isolated pings are part of network scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- If a sudden surge in ICMP Echo Requests is detected, apply heuristics related to volumetric ICMP attacks and classify under taxonomy class "Denial of Service" or "Network Flooding."
