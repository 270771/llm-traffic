Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All provided Zeek conn.log entries show TCP traffic only, with no ICMP protocol records present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and no ICMP traffic is logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is available to suggest otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP traffic with type 8 is present. Monitoring for unusual ICMP volume or repeated Echo Requests would be necessary to detect ping floods.
