Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8, 128, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, only one record shows ICMP type 8 (first line), but it is a single connection with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- The other ICMP types (128 = ICMPv6 Echo Request, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no attack unless clear flooding patterns appear.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency or volume from the same IPs.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets for possible traceroute or network issues, but these are not attacks.  
- If anomalies appear later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving thresholds on packet rate and volume.

Heuristic and taxonomy: Not applicable here due to lack of anomalies and no flooding pattern.
