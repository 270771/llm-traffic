Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), which is a valid ping request, but the packet count and timing do not indicate a flood pattern (only 1 packet with 2000 bytes at one timestamp).  
- The second ICMP record is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 and therefore cannot be a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 46.108.125.224 if it sends multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Confirm if ICMP type 11 traffic is expected in the network or if it indicates routing issues or traceroute activity.
