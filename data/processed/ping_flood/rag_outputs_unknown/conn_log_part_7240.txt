Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 13, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 indicates "Timestamp Request," neither of which are used in ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by standard ICMP behavior taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is typically related to network errors or misconfigurations, not attacks.  
- ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) is generally benign or used for network diagnostics.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no underlying network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
