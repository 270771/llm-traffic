Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single event without evidence of high volume or flooding patterns. No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned. Generally, ping flood attacks correspond to heuristic patterns involving high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic.

Next Steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 157.206.89.152 to 69.232.166.26. If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to detect abnormal ICMP patterns.
