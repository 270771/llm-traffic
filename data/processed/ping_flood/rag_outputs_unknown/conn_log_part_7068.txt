Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type values of 0 or 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of excessive ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic for potential other issues such as network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
