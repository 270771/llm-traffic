Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (the 4th column after source IP) shows values 128, 11, 8, and 8 in the entries. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are two entries with ICMP type 8, but the packet counts and durations are very low (mostly zero or one packet), indicating no high-volume or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (128, 11) correspond to different ICMP messages (e.g., Echo Reply or Time Exceeded), not ping flood indicators.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. By default, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 8 packets (125.131.136.11 and 119.114.146.72) for any increase in volume or frequency over time.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
