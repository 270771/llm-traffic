Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1 or 0 (fields 4 and 10), none have ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. ICMP type 1 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 corresponds to "Echo Reply," neither of which indicate a ping flood. The traffic shows isolated ICMP messages without the characteristic high-rate echo requests from a single source to a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP traffic may be normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 203.78.137.66, 203.78.140.213, and 130.187.195.144 for unusual ICMP activity patterns over time.  
- Collect additional logs or enable more detailed ICMP logging to detect potential future ping floods.
