Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have an ICMP type field value of 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be ICMP but not of the type used in ping floods.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent other ICMP-based activity (e.g., Echo Reply or other control messages). Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
