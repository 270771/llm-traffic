Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 1 or 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 1 is Echo Reply, and type 0 is typically Echo Reply as well, indicating responses rather than requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 1 and 0 traffic to ensure it is legitimate reply traffic and not part of another anomaly such as ICMP reply floods or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If unusual ICMP reply traffic volume is observed, consider applying heuristics related to ICMP reply floods or reconnaissance once heuristic context is available.
