Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but only a single packet is logged, not a flood or high volume of requests typical of a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.  
- ICMP type 8 alone does not indicate flooding without volume or rate anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.227.208.174) to destination (52.222.245.10) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.250.216.227 sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual traceroute or network issues are suspected.
