Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with SYN packets (S0 state) and no ICMP traffic is present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP Echo Request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP records or types are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the observed traffic appears to be numerous failed TCP connection attempts (SYN scans or connection attempts), which could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the source IPs (e.g., 89.247.69.180, 104.250.73.21) for potential scanning behavior. Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for port scan detection heuristics. Monitor for repeated connection attempts and consider applying rate limiting or blocking suspicious IPs to mitigate scanning.
