Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with type values other than 8 (Echo Request), specifically type 1 (Echo Reply) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable). Only two entries have ICMP type 8, but they are isolated and do not indicate a flood pattern (no rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination). The presence of type 1 and 3 packets further confirms normal ICMP traffic or other ICMP message types, not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the key heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of numerous ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a short time frame, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 messages (e.g., 203.78.137.66) to ensure no network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from any IP to detect potential future ping floods.
