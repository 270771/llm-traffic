Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of the ICMP Timestamp Requests from 133.243.115.124 to 170.17.77.22 to rule out reconnaissance or misconfiguration, but no immediate threat related to ping flooding is detected.
