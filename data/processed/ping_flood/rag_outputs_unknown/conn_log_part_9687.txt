Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (fields 4 and 10), none have type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 indicates these are not echo requests but likely echo replies or other ICMP message types, which do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the nature of these ICMP messages further to determine if they relate to other ICMP-based activities such as network scanning or error messages. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
