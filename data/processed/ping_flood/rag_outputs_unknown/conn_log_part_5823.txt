Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the field after the destination IP, which is 0), not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection states but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) from 138.159.19.249 to 203.78.143.78 to ensure it is legitimate response traffic and not part of a reflection or amplification attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal traffic volume.
