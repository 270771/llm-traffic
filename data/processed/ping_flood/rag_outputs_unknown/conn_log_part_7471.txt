Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field is missing or marked as "-", which means the traffic does not explicitly show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is "OTH" (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection but not necessarily a flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest this is a ping flood or related attack.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The "OTH" state and lack of ICMP type 8 suggest this traffic should be investigated further for potential reconnaissance or malformed packets, but it does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Capture full ICMP packet details including type and code fields.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP (202.250.202.133) to detect potential flooding.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for suspicious ICMP activity.
