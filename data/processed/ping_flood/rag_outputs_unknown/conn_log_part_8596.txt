Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or repeated echo requests from the same source IPs to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if these ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.
