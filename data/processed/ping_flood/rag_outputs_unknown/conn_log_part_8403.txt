Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used for ping.
- The volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013225.57) indicates a coordinated flood.
- The rapid succession and multiplicity of sources flooding the same target IP with ICMP type 8 packets matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 163.84.73.84 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0)
- Source IPs include multiple addresses such as 157.206.81.4, 133.243.87.224, 157.206.82.193, 157.206.119.38, 130.187.229.30, and many others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 163.84.73.84.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement and consider blacklisting or blocking them upstream.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and prepare to escalate to upstream ISP for traffic filtering if attack volume increases.
- Ensure the target host has appropriate ICMP flood mitigation configured (e.g., ICMP rate limiting, firewall rules).
