Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 58.142.235.227 to destination IP 133.251.77.191 with a single packet (count=1) and 28 bytes. This does not indicate a flood, which would require a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame. The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated OTH (other) connection states.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
