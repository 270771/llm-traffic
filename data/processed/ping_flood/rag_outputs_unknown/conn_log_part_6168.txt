Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the field with value 0 after the IP addresses), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets of type 0, which corresponds to Echo Reply or other ICMP messages, not indicative of a flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any other suspicious activity or different attack types, but no immediate action for ping flood is warranted. If ICMP traffic volume spikes or type 8 packets appear, reassess for potential ping flood.
