Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 133.243.173.85 to destination 14.251.102.91, with a single packet (count=1) and a duration of about 1 second. This does not indicate a flood, which would require a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame. The other ICMP entries have type 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types that might indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
