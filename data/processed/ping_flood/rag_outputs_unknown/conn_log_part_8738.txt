Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections, but only two entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping requests. However, these entries are isolated and do not indicate a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP abuse or volumetric attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate the two ICMP type 8 connections (from 60.235.31.150 to 16.92.198.78 and from 133.243.206.29 to 23.241.216.11) for any unusual patterns or repeated attempts.  
- Enable rate limiting or anomaly detection on ICMP traffic to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.
