Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.206.171.253, 157.206.171.216, 157.206.125.188, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP 18.46.237.125 in rapid succession.
- The volume and distribution of these ICMP Echo Requests from many different sources targeting a single IP strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single host."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 18.46.237.125 (receiving the flood)
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.206.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.243.x.x, 133.227.x.x) are sending ICMP type 8 packets.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 18.46.237.125.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood if they are internal or known to be compromised.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or solution if the attack volume is large and persistent.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and to apply host-based mitigations such as ICMP rate limiting.
