Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or error reporting.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
