Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent from multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.103.6, 133.243.99.202, 157.206.195.156, etc.) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.39.157.141 and 69.232.167.15) within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.19). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target IP is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic number is **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target**.  
- The taxonomy class is **T1: ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service Attack**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.103.6, 133.243.99.202, 157.206.195.156, 133.243.99.250, etc.  
- Destination IPs: Primarily 3.39.157.141 and 69.232.167.15.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking IP ranges.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts or network devices.  
6. Notify affected parties and prepare incident response for potential service degradation or denial of service impact.
