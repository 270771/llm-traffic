Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the frequency and volume of ICMP type 13 packets from 157.206.49.81 to 188.226.144.45 to rule out other reconnaissance or timing-based attacks. Also, monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a future ping flood.
