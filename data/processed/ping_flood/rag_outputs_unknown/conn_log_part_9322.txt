Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port, here showing "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. 

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 1 traffic between these IPs to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
