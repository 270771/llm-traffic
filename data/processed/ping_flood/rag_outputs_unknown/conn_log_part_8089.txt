Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 11, or 128/129 (IPv6), none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., type 11 = Time Exceeded, type 0 = Echo Reply, type 128/129 = ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of these ICMP messages, especially the Time Exceeded (type 11) packets, as they may indicate network issues or traceroute activity. Monitoring for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect future ping flood attempts.
