Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or DoS via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. Typically, heuristic #1 corresponds to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS/Probe" would apply if such traffic were present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from single or multiple sources.  
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
