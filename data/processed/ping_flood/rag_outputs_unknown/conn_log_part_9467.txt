Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be identified by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the provided snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present in the conn.log snippet.
- The traffic is predominantly UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connections with SYN flags but no established sessions, indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, not ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed UDP traffic on port 5060 may warrant investigation for SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses on port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or UDP-based DoS.
- Monitor for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in future logs to detect actual ping flood attempts.
