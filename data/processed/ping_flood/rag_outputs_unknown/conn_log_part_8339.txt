Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 1 (ICMP code field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no further classification can be assigned. 

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 130.187.195.247 and destination IP 42.108.139.144 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages, but no immediate attack response is required.
