Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have the ICMP type field (the 17th column) values as 2, 3, 1, and 4, none of which is 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the presence of type 8 is required to identify a ping flood, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The traffic shows various ICMP types (such as type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 1 = Host Unreachable, type 2 = Protocol Unreachable, type 4 = Source Quench), which may indicate network issues or other ICMP-related events but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, these ICMP types typically fall under network error or diagnostic messages rather than attack categories.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the multiple ICMP error messages (types 1, 2, 3, 4) to rule out network misconfigurations or other issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
