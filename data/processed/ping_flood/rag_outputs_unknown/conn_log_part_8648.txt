Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP types observed correspond to "Destination Unreachable" (type 3) and "Router Advertisement" or other informational messages (type 10), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues, but no immediate attack response is required. If further anomalies appear with ICMP type 8 and high packet rates, reassess for ping flood activity.
