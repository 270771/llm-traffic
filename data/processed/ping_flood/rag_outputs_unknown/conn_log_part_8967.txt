Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.197.247.113) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013230.37). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources flooding one target—is a classic signature of an ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.197.247.113 (destination)  
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in the 157.206.x.x range (e.g., 157.206.171.253, 157.206.103.51, 157.206.142.57, etc.)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.197.247.113.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to apply traffic filtering or blackholing if the attack volume is large.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.  
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify compromised hosts within the 157.206.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
