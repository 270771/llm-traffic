Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The connections show mostly SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping flood applies.
- The observed traffic pattern (many SYN attempts without completion) could align with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically heuristic #1 (Port Scanning) and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance."

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion for potential scanning or probing activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs (e.g., 45.121.95.154 repeatedly targeting UDP port 5060).
