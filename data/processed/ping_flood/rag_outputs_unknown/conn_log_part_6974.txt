Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries have types 1 or 13, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the records show type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

- ICMP type 1 is Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, neither of which indicate a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents direct referencing, but by standard ICMP behavior, only type 8 traffic is relevant for ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these logs. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP control or diagnostic messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 1 or 13 messages that could indicate other reconnaissance or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
