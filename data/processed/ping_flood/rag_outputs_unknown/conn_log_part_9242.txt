Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 3 typically relates to network errors, and type 0 is a reply, neither indicating flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs containing a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests with high frequency to confirm or rule out ping flood activity.
