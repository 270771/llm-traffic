Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of the ICMP Timestamp Requests between 131.140.120.8 and 185.138.73.88 to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics and not part of reconnaissance or other suspicious activity. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 13 traffic could be warranted.
