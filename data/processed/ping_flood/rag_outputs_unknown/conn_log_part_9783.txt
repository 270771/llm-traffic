Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (13.24.95.251) sending numerous ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.009 seconds between packets). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from one source to many destinations" typically labeled under a taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.24.95.251; Destination IPs include 163.45.91.242, 163.45.180.199, 163.45.180.129, 163.45.91.1, 163.45.91.217, 163.45.180.162, 163.45.49.10, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood relevance.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.24.95.251 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Implement network-level ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to raise awareness and coordinate mitigation if needed.
