Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood from a single source."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for additional signs of volumetric ICMP attacks or other DoS vectors.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.  
5. Review and update network ACLs to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic where possible.
