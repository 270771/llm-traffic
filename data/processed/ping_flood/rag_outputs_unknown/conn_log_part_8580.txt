Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code "3" in both source and destination port fields, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification can be assigned. 

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other issues such as unreachable hosts, but this is not a denial-of-service ping flood. Monitoring for volume spikes or other ICMP types is recommended.
