Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are `11` and `3`, neither of which is `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded," and type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," which are control messages, not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this traffic is normal ICMP control messaging, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the volume or frequency of these ICMP control messages is abnormally high, which could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
