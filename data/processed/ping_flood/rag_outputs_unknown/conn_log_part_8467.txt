Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from multiple source IPs (notably 18.114.215.35 and several 133.243.x.x addresses) targeting multiple destination IPs (e.g., 203.78.x.x and 54.196.70.79). The ICMP type 8 is the key indicator of ping requests, and the rapid succession of these requests with very low response times (some as low as 0.000124 seconds) strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.  
- Taxonomy class: **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IP addresses and ports:  
- Source IPs: 18.114.215.35, 133.243.5.53, 133.243.210.150, 133.243.210.178, 133.243.82.241, 133.243.100.233, 133.243.130.123, 133.243.130.32, 133.243.169.121, 133.243.182.205, 133.243.182.46, 133.243.210.247, 133.243.224.57, 133.243.135.185, 133.243.72.4  
- Destination IPs: 203.78.130.168, 203.78.133.117, 203.78.146.144, 203.78.129.61, 203.78.136.215, 203.78.136.250, 203.78.143.78, 203.78.143.156, 54.196.70.79  
- ICMP does not use ports, but the log shows ICMP protocol with type 8.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or throttle malicious ICMP traffic if attack volume is large.  
4. Monitor affected destination IPs for service degradation and prepare mitigation such as blackholing or scrubbing services if needed.  
5. Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.  
6. Educate network teams to recognize and respond to ICMP flood patterns promptly.
