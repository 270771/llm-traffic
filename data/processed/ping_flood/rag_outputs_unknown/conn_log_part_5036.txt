Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The traffic consists mainly of TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), but no ICMP traffic is recorded.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. The observed TCP SYN attempts could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity, but this is not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential SYN flood or scanning attacks by reviewing SYN packet rates, connection success ratios, and correlating with firewall or IDS logs. Also, enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.
