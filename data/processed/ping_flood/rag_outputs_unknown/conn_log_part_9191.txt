Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the safest classification is that this is normal or benign ICMP traffic related to network diagnostics or routing issues.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.120 and destination IP 49.64.122.189 for any unusual patterns or repeated ICMP Time Exceeded messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or routing loops. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential future ping floods.
