Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "3" for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 3 messages over time, which could indicate network issues or other ICMP-based attacks. Monitoring for ICMP type 8 floods should continue.
