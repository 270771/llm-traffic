Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source and destination IPs and ports), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 messages, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations, but this is not indicative of a ping flood attack.
