Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not confirm a ping flood or other specific attack.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no direct mapping can be made. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood detection here.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies. If TCP SYN scans are suspected, further analysis of connection patterns and volumes should be conducted.
