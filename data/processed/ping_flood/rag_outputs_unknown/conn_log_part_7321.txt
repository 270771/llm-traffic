Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but the connection states are "OTH" (other) and the packet counts are extremely low (1 and 0 packets). There is no evidence of high-volume or sustained ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the low packet counts and lack of sustained traffic indicate no attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume or repeated connection attempts from these IPs. If volume spikes or connection states change to indicate ongoing sessions, further investigation should be initiated.
