Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries, but only three entries from source IP 54.236.220.60 have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, these requests are sparse and directed at different destination IPs (163.45.192.144, 163.45.252.232, 163.45.192.39) with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types other than 8, which do not qualify as ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP abuse.

Next steps:  
Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP Echo Requests from 54.236.220.60. If the rate increases significantly or targets a single IP repeatedly, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to identify abnormal ICMP patterns.
