Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.204.185 to destination 54.203.14.148, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic. The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of repeated ICMP Echo Requests or high packet counts, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 157.206.204.185 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to confirm no stealthy ping attempts.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP traffic volume.  
- If other ICMP types (e.g., type 11 Time Exceeded) increase abnormally, consider investigating potential traceroute or network scanning activity.
