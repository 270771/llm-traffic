Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP packets, but none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The ICMP types observed are 0, 1, 3, 11, 128, and 129, which correspond to Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, and IPv6 Echo Request/Reply variants, but not the classic ICMP Echo Request flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) packets for potential network issues or other attack types such as reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
