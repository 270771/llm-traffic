Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP error messages rather than a flood.

Next steps: Investigate why the host 163.45.185.21 is sending ICMP type 3 messages to 212.220.241.131, as this may indicate network issues or misconfigurations, but it is not indicative of a ping flood attack.
