Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring. Also, monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
