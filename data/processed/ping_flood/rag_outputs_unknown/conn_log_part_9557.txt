Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP-related entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 or are not ICMP at all. The only ICMP-like entry is at timestamp 1641013232.043324 with ICMP type 4, which is not an echo request (type 8) and therefore does not indicate a ping flood. The majority of traffic is UDP or TCP with no evidence of high-rate ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of ping floods.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context was provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no other suspicious patterns such as SYN floods or UDP floods, no attack is currently detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses, as repeated UDP connections with S0 state and short durations may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request traffic or other signs of volumetric attacks.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP type filtering and anomaly detection to improve future detection capabilities.
