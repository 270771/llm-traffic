Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not indicated here.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a host.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given logs. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, but nothing matching typical DoS or scanning anomalies without further context.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic/taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS" would apply to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs that include ICMP protocol details to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are flooding the network.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific monitoring and anomaly detection rules.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP rate anomalies.
