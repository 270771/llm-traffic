Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (35.211.173.188) targeting numerous destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps within milliseconds). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The high volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 35.211.173.188  
- Multiple destination IPs: 203.78.143.40, 203.78.128.75, 203.78.128.240, 203.78.132.159, 203.78.143.121, 203.78.132.69, 203.78.128.228, 203.78.143.2, 203.78.146.144, 203.78.146.250  
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.211.173.188 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor for continued or similar ICMP flood attempts from other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.  
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network monitoring tools to alert on similar patterns.  
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
