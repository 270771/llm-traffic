Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would have protocol number 1, but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP protocol entries; instead, the majority of suspicious traffic is UDP on port 5060 and various TCP connections.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 is likely SIP signaling traffic or scanning attempts, not ICMP echo requests (type 8).
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, the traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern, which requires ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another specific attack type, but the repeated UDP attempts to port 5060 with flags S0 and D indicate possible UDP scanning or SIP flood attempts, which should be investigated separately.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the observed UDP port 5060 traffic with repeated failed connection attempts (S0) aligns with reconnaissance or scanning heuristics commonly labeled as "Network Scanning" or "UDP Flooding" but not ping flood.
- The TCP entries with S0 flags and single packets also suggest scanning or connection attempts, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 45.121.95.154 for potential SIP scanning or UDP flood activity.
- Monitor for ICMP echo request traffic to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect any future ping flood activity.
