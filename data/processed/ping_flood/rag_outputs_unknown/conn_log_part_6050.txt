Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from two source IPs (203.78.143.78 and 183.204.158.107) to their respective destinations, which is consistent with normal ping requests.  
- However, the volume and frequency of these requests do not indicate a flood pattern. The timestamps are close but do not show a high rate of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 3 is unrelated to ping floods, as type 3 is Destination Unreachable, not Echo Request (type 8).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class applies here.  
- Typically, heuristic for ping flood would involve detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP.  
- Investigate if any source IP shows a sudden spike in ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with network performance issues or alerts from IDS/IPS systems for potential ICMP-based DoS attacks.
