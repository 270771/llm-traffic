Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, which is not indicated here.  
- The traffic shows multiple UDP connections on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP connection attempts, but none match the pattern of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests typical of ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- Typically, ping flood attacks fall under DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP Echo Request floods.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP scanning or other VoIP-related reconnaissance or abuse.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or unusual ICMP types in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to better detect ICMP-based attacks.
