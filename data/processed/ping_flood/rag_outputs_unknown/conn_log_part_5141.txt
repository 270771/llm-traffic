Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. This aligns with heuristic classes related to port scanning or connection flooding, which should be confirmed with additional logs or IDS alerts.
