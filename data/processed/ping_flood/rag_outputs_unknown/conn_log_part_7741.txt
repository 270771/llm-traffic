Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.97, but it is a single event, not a flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination, which would indicate a potential ping flood. Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if such patterns emerge.
