Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field indicated as `11` (third column after source IP), which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the default understanding is that ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or network diagnostic messages, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the volume or frequency of ICMP type 11 messages is unusually high, which could indicate network issues or other reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods in the future.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for comprehensive threat detection.
