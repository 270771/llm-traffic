Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (54.249.65.236) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.45.x.x subnet.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages, the standard for ping.
- The packets are sent in rapid succession (timestamps within milliseconds), consistent with a flood pattern.
- This matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood from a single source."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 54.249.65.236
- Multiple victim/destination IPs: 163.45.224.47, 163.45.224.46, 163.45.224.5, 163.45.13.218, 163.45.13.220, 163.45.151.158, 163.45.215.5, 163.45.151.132, 163.45.151.129, 163.45.215.6, 163.45.109.58, 163.45.215.7, 163.45.109.57, 163.45.13.191, 163.45.4.253, 163.45.109.5, 163.45.120.74, 163.45.94.122, 163.45.94.25, 163.45.94.22, 163.45.186.72
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.65.236 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other suspicious activity from this or related IPs.
3. Notify network operations and affected subnet owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting on internal routers to mitigate impact.
5. Consider blacklisting the attacker IP in upstream provider filters if attack persists.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify any compromised hosts or vulnerabilities exploited to launch the attack.
