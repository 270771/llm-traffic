Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Time Exceeded messages are being generated between these hosts, as it may indicate routing issues or traceroute activity, but it is not a ping flood. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
