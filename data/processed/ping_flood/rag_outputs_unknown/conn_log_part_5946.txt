Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple values, but only entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the ICMP type 8 entries are sparse and isolated, not showing a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding. Other ICMP types (0, 3) are present, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of repeated ICMP type 8 traffic at scale suggests no ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the sources of ICMP type 8 packets (e.g., 183.126.250.224 and 143.5.202.233) for any unusual behavior or spikes over a longer time window. Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
