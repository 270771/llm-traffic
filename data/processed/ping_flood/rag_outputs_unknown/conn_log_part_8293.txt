Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Request (type 8) entries with high frequency from the same source IP to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
