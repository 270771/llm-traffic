Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections show protocol 11 (ICMP) but the ICMP type field is missing or not indicated as type 8 (Echo Request). Since the key criterion for a ping flood is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns. The connections are marked as OTH (other) state, with no payload or repeated requests visible.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify the ICMP type and frequency. If ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or other types are present in high volume, consider other ICMP-based attacks or network misconfigurations.
