Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a single source IP (13.132.168.223) sending numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~milliseconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets to many targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP echo requests from a single source to multiple destinations," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.132.168.223; Destination IPs include 133.105.129.6, 133.105.129.5, 133.105.129.137, 133.105.143.2, 133.105.143.0, 133.105.138.218, 133.105.138.253, 133.105.138.222, 133.105.139.1, 133.105.135.246, 133.105.128.254, 133.105.128.253, 133.105.135.247. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.132.168.223 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch future occurrences.
  5. Notify affected network administrators of targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential impact.
