Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, the only ICMP type 8 record is from source IP 43.165.251.220 to destination 163.45.101.177, but it shows only 1 packet with 28 bytes, which is insufficient volume or frequency to indicate a ping flood. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of high-volume ICMP Echo Requests excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 43.165.251.220 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning.  
- Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP unreachable or time exceeded messages, which may indicate network issues or other attack types.  
- If high ICMP traffic volume appears later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high packet rate of ICMP type 8) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service - ICMP Flood."
