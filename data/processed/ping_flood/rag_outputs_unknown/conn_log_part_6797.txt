Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the fourth field after the source IP. The entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are from 35.83.191.13 to 163.45.114.153 and 163.45.254.133, which are valid ping requests. However, the volume of these requests is extremely low (only one packet per connection record), and there is no indication of rapid or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination that would characterize a ping flood.

The other ICMP entry has type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, heuristic for ping flood would involve detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets is observed, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 messages for possible network issues or misconfigurations.
