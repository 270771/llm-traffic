Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets for potential TCP SYN scan or DoS attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.  
- Establish heuristics for TCP connection anomalies and ICMP traffic monitoring to improve detection capabilities.
