Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an ICMP message outside typical connection states, consistent with ICMP error or control messages rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 195.157.247.78 and destination IP 133.251.136.182 for unusual ICMP error message patterns or other suspicious activity, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
