Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying ping flood attacks. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why ICMP type 3 and 0 packets are present; these could indicate network issues or other benign ICMP activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- If suspicious traffic volume or patterns emerge, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for further analysis.
