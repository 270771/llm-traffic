Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 traffic can be considered for ping flood detection. However, a single ICMP Echo Request does not indicate flooding by itself. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 message (from 133.105.128.252 to 185.167.248.21) if it recurs frequently, as it may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
