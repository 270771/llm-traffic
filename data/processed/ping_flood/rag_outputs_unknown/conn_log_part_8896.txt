Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 157.206.1.6 to 54.77.241.159 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping).  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.141.148 to 66.104.113.91 with ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, not a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP echo requests from a single source targeting a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The presence of only two isolated ICMP packets with different source/destination IPs and types does not indicate flooding.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP echo requests or other suspicious patterns.
