Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8, 3, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the first entry has ICMP type 8 from source IP 103.23.236.133 to destination 163.45.13.142, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other entries are ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume or rapid succession, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 103.23.236.133 if it begins sending multiple echo requests rapidly.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP echo requests if volume spikes.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned at this time.
