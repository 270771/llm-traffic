Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP type fields are logged.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no classification can be assigned at this time.
