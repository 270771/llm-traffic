Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may indicate traceroute or other diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP type 11 messages that could indicate network issues or other reconnaissance attempts, but no immediate security response for ping flood is warranted.
