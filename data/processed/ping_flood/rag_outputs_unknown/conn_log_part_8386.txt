Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from source IP 52.196.212.42 to multiple destination IPs (203.78.130.177, 203.78.162.33, 203.78.130.175, 203.78.152.1) indicate normal ping activity. However, the volume and frequency in this snippet are low and do not show the high packet rate or sustained burst typical of a ping flood attack. Other ICMP types present (type 11 and 0) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume anomalies.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased ICMP echo request rates from these or other IPs. Investigate if the source IP 52.196.212.42 continues to send high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets over time, which could indicate a developing ping flood. Also, review network baseline traffic to establish normal ICMP patterns.
