Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. These entries indicate ICMP error messages rather than ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available, but the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP type 3 messages are being generated from these source IPs, as this may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity. Monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect potential ping floods.
