Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (last field before the count and size fields), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) between these IPs to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different ICMP-based attack or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other unusual traffic patterns.
