Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8, which is Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from a single source, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP traffic from the same IPs.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network scanning activities, as these entries could represent benign or other ICMP traffic types.
