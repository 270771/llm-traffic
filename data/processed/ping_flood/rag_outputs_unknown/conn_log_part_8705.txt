Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field value `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the ICMP type 3, this traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (130.187.37.249) and destination IPs (172.23.14.184, 185.167.249.223) for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-based reconnaissance. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
