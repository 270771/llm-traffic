Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, but no ICMP traffic is logged here.  
- The connections show mostly SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), typical of port scans or connection attempts, not ICMP floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed traffic pattern aligns with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the repeated UDP attempts from 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs on port 5060 (SIP signaling port), which may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present.
