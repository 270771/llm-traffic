Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic may indicate network issues or scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.159.37 for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious behavior, and monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
