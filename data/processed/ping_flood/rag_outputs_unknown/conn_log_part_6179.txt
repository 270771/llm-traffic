Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry has ICMP type 8 from source IP 143.5.202.233 to destination 133.251.96.13, but the connection state is OTH (other), and the packet count is very low (1 packet). The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the low volume and lack of repeated ICMP Echo Requests indicate no flooding pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.  
- If ICMP type 8 traffic volume increases significantly, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high-rate ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood."
