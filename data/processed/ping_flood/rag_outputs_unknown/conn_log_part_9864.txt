Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why the connection state is OTH and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs (130.187.24.209 and 54.129.195.3). If a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets appears, reassess for potential ping flood activity.
