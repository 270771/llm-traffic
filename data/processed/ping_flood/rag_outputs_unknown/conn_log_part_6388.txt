Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were detected in the provided anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack classifications.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic for potential network misconfigurations or other benign issues, but no immediate attack response is required.
