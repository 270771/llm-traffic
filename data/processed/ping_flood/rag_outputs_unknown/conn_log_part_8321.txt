Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the ICMP type and lack of anomalies, this appears to be normal ICMP reply traffic.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood. However, monitoring for a surge in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs (39.163.76.132 and 163.45.15.182) is recommended to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
