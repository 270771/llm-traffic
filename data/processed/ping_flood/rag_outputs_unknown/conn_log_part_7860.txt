Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 3 or 11 (indicated by the field after the source IP, e.g., "3" or "11"), which correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, respectively. None of the entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic consists of ICMP error messages rather than echo requests, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages from 203.78.140.235 to various destination IPs. This could indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or scanning activity. Monitoring for unusual ICMP error rates or correlating with other logs may help clarify the situation.
