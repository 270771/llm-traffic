Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP packets from the same source IP (151.105.96.5) to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.20 and 133.105.230.30). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests that would indicate a flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is "OTH" (other), and the flags indicate no retransmissions or errors.

No other attack type is indicated by this data.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from this or other sources. If a surge in ICMP traffic is detected, investigate for potential ICMP flood or other denial-of-service activity.
