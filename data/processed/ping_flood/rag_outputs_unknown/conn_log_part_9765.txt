Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 0, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the first entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and the second is type 0 (Echo Reply), neither represents the initiation of a ping flood attack. A ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm the target.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no suspicious volume or pattern, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages (133.243.154.254 â†’ 167.246.129.27) to understand why Destination Unreachable messages are generated, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high-rate ICMP Echo Requests for future detection.
