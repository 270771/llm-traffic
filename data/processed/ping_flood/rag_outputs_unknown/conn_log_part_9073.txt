Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type values of 1 or 10, none have type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Without ICMP type 8, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP echo requests and no other suspicious indicators, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 1 and 10 traffic to ensure they are legitimate control or error messages and not part of another attack vector.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
