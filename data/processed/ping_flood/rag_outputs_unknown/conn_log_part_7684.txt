Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, a single or very limited number of ICMP Echo Requests do not constitute a ping flood attack, which typically involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious volume or patterns. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, there is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Request traffic characteristic of a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristics or taxonomy data are provided, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 3 traffic is unrelated to ping floods and typically indicates network errors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 24.26.170.70 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests to 133.105.226.7 at high frequency.  
- Implement threshold-based alerts for ICMP Echo Request rates to detect volumetric attacks.
