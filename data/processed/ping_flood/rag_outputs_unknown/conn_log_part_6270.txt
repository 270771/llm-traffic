Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 11 messages is unusually high, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.
