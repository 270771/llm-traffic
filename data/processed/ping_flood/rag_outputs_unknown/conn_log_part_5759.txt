Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have types 1, 3, or 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. The observed ICMP types correspond to:

- Type 1: ICMP Destination Unreachable (likely an error message)
- Type 3: ICMP Destination Unreachable (various codes)
- Type 11: ICMP Time Exceeded (used in traceroute)

These indicate normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing these ICMP error messages, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is evident.
