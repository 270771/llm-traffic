Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with flags like S0 (SYN sent, no response), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled. Also, monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.
