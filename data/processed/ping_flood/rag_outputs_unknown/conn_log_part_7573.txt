Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration messages, which are normal network diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of these ICMP type 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a different reconnaissance or network scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
