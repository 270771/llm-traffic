Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.197.133, 133.243.195.186, 133.243.18.222, etc.) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 54.227.90.79 within the same second (timestamp 1641013210.858xxx). This pattern of many sources simultaneously sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host" and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood / Denial of Service."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.227.90.79. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.243.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the target host 54.227.90.79 for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to broader DDoS mitigation services if attack volume increases.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts to prevent recurrence.
