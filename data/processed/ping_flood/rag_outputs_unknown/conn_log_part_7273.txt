Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 191.29.224.6, with a single connection record and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entry has type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ping floods correspond to ICMP type 8 traffic with high frequency and volume, which is absent here.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP over a short time window to detect potential flooding. Investigate if the source IP 203.78.143.78 generates multiple echo requests in a short period or if other logs show increased ICMP traffic volume.
