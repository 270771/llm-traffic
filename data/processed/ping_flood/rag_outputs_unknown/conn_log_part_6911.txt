Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior. Without heuristic context, the default assumption is that this traffic is normal ICMP reply traffic.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.145.55.236 to detect potential ping floods.
