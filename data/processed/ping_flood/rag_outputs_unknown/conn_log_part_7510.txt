Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates ICMP error messages rather than ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 messages could warrant investigation into network reachability issues or potential scanning activity, but this is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential ping floods. Also, review network device logs for connectivity problems related to these ICMP errors.
