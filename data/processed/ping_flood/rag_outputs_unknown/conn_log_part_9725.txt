Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but the ICMP type values are mostly 3, 13, and 1. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 1 is Echo Reply, none of which constitute a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source of the ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics or error messages and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
