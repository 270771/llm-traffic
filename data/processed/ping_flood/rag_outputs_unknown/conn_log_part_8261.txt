Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is ICMP but not Echo Requests, this could represent normal reply traffic or possibly a different ICMP-based activity, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (150.227.97.96) or to the destination (119.216.5.137) over time. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests with short intervals, which would indicate a ping flood. Also, verify if other ICMP types or unusual connection states appear frequently to rule out other ICMP-based attacks.
