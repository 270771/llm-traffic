Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis for ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messaging. Monitoring for unusual volumes or patterns of these ICMP types could be warranted.
