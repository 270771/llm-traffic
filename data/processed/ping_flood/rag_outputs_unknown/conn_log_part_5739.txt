Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All the ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections show OTH (other) state with no payload or retransmissions, consistent with normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 traffic is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (154.137.253.245, 203.78.136.88, 133.243.19.170) for unusual ICMP error message patterns or volume over a longer time window to rule out reconnaissance or misconfiguration. Also, verify network devices for routing loops or misconfigurations causing excessive ICMP time exceeded messages.
