Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this is normal ICMP control traffic, possibly related to traceroute or TTL expiration.

No attack is detected here. Further investigation could focus on monitoring for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets if ping flood suspicion arises later.
