Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (icmp.log) are available to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Review network traffic for other potential DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN_SENT (S0) states, which could indicate scanning or connection attempts.  
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning or connection flooding if further evidence arises.
