Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, no ping flood or related ICMP flooding attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if additional logs contain ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from a single source to confirm or rule out ping flood.  
- Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP floods with other types or fragmented ICMP packets.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
