Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume and connection characteristics do not indicate flooding. The logs show only two ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (35.211.173.188) to two different destination IPs (163.45.177.128 and 163.45.177.129) with a single packet each and no rapid repetition or high packet count typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from this or other sources. If a sudden surge in ICMP type 8 packets occurs targeting one or multiple hosts, investigate for potential ping flood or DoS activity.
