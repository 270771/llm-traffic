Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no specific classification can be assigned. Generally, ping floods are identified by heuristic patterns involving high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types that may indicate other network issues or attacks.
