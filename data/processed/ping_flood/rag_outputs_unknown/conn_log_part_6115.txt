Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No continuous or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given this, no known ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in Echo Requests if they appear in extended logs.
