Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these entries do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
