Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) entries with high frequency from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) or to the same destination (133.251.160.97) in other logs to rule out potential ping floods or reconnaissance activity.
