Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.23.69.72.
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct (e.g., 133.243.184.120, 133.243.75.220, 133.243.196.6, etc.), all sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously within the same timestamp (1641013230.069xxx).
- This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP type 8 packets to one target in a short time frame matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the victim with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most relevant heuristic is:
  - Heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 3.23.69.72 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is not applicable).
- Multiple attacker/source IPs from the 133.243.x.x subnet.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.23.69.72.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from identified attacking IPs if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
