Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping.
- Multiple ICMP Echo Requests are sent in rapid succession from single source IPs (3.241.1.60 and 172.23.68.231) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds).
- This pattern of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm targets with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: 3.241.1.60, 172.23.68.231
- Destination IPs: 163.45.163.255, 163.45.164.175, 163.45.164.254, 163.45.164.177, 203.78.160.53
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (3.241.1.60 and 172.23.68.231) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or new sources of ICMP flooding.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic while allowing legitimate network diagnostics.
