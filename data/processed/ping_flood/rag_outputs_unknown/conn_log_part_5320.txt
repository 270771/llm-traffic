Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack types are clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show failed TCP handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, often classified under network scanning or probing taxonomy.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for possible ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
