Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is `3` (destination unreachable), not `8` (echo request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 indicates error messages rather than a flood or scan.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP destination unreachable messages are being generated between 203.78.136.139 and 101.33.172.120, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or connectivity issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
