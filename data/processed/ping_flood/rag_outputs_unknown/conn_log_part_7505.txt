Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the logs show only two isolated ICMP packets from the same source IP (172.23.68.231) to different destination IPs, with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and there is no evidence of sustained or overwhelming traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate a ping flood or other attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this or other sources. If a large number of ICMP Echo Requests are observed in a short time frame targeting one or multiple hosts, re-evaluate for a ping flood attack.
