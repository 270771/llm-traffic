Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 45.225.96.135 to 163.45.223.242 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). The second entry shows ICMP type 3, which is a destination unreachable message, not related to ping floods. However, there is only a single echo request recorded, not a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP echo requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other indicators, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.
