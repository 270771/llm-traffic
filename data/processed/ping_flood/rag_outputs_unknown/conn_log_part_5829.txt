Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but given the Zeek conn.log format and the absence of type 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the required condition for a ping flood attack. The ICMP type is likely not 8, as indicated by the "-" placeholders in the ICMP-specific fields.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and code fields. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 2a02:dc70:3901:b303:fcef:23:d70b:66a to the destination 2001:fcff:fa79:c0fd:e:7ff:fe1e:3a07, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.
