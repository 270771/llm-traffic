Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from multiple source IPs (mostly in the 157.206.x.x range) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26). The high frequency of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641013232.99) is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection heuristic (commonly heuristic #3 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Flood").  
- Taxonomy class: "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Layer Attack."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.6.253, 157.206.229.133, 157.206.149.10, 157.206.123.16, 157.206.40.185, etc.  
- Destination IPs: Primarily 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify affected network owners (54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) to prepare for potential service degradation.  
4. Monitor network traffic for escalation or spread to other targets.  
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent attacking IPs if mitigation at the perimeter is insufficient.  
6. Review upstream provider support for volumetric attack mitigation (e.g., scrubbing services).
