Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate other logs (e.g., ICMP-specific logs or packet captures) to confirm if ICMP traffic is present.
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP connections show SYN attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not ping flood.
- If suspicious TCP SYN floods or other anomalies appear, apply heuristics related to SYN flood or port scanning.
