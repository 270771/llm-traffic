Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no unusual behavior.

No immediate attack is detected. However, further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.243.206.29 to detect potential future ping floods.
