Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are sent from numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 157.206.5.6, 157.206.114.27, 157.206.228.253, 192.207.221.6, etc.) targeting a single destination IP 163.84.73.84.
- The packets are sent in rapid succession with very low inter-arrival times (some as low as 0.000002 seconds), consistent with a high-rate ICMP Echo Request flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, confirming these are ping attempts.
- The volume and distribution of sources strongly indicate a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly records are provided, this matches the classic heuristic for ICMP flood detection: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single victim.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 163.84.73.84 (destination)
- Multiple attacker IPs: 157.206.5.6, 157.206.114.27, 157.206.228.253, 192.207.221.6, 157.206.110.252, 157.206.216.253, 157.206.158.254, 133.243.220.21, 133.227.58.122, 203.78.139.194, etc.
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 163.84.73.84.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from identified attacker IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible.
- Conduct forensic analysis to identify potential compromised hosts within the attacker IP ranges.
