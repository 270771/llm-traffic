Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types. The key indicator for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Here, the majority of ICMP packets from 13.24.95.251 to multiple destinations are type 8, which could be normal ping traffic. However, the volume and timing do not indicate a flood pattern (e.g., extremely high frequency or sustained burst). Also, one entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and another type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not relevant to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to support labeling this as a ping flood or any other attack. Without evidence of excessive ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target, this traffic appears benign or normal diagnostic pings.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.  

Heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
