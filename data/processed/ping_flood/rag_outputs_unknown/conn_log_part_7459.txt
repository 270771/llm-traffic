Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log entry is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th field after the source IP and port, here "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is ICMP but not type 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP Echo Replies from 95.210.174.206 to 163.45.185.21 to ensure they are expected responses and verify no other suspicious ICMP traffic (type 8) is present in broader logs.
