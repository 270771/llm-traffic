Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `11`, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectively. A ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages are typically related to network diagnostics or error reporting, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of these ICMP error messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
