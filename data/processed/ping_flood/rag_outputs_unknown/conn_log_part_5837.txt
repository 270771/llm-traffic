Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8, which is Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not match the known pattern for ping floods, which rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types and payloads.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for correlated alerts on these IP addresses.
