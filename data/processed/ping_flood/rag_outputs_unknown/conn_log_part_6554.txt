Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is the first record from 133.243.208.115 to 35.95.248.147, but it is a single connection with 725 bytes and no indication of rapid repeated requests or volume typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required. However, monitoring ICMP traffic volume and frequency from these IPs could be a prudent next step to detect any emerging anomalies.
