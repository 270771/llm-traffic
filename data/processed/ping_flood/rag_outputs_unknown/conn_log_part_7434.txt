Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Without evidence of ICMP type 8 traffic or high-volume repetitive ICMP requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No immediate attack is detected. However, further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 133.227.159.48 to 167.46.181.18 to rule out potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
