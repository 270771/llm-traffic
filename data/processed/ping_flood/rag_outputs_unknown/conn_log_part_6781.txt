Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: Multiple ICMP connections are observed targeting the same destination IP 35.87.78.209 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping requests. The high frequency of these echo requests from different source IPs (133.227.7.116, 133.227.206.33, 133.227.211.1, 133.227.90.1, 133.227.225.149) to a single target strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: 133.227.7.116, 133.227.206.33, 133.227.211.1, 133.227.90.1, 133.227.225.149
- Destination: 35.87.78.209
Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 35.87.78.209 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential sources of ICMP flood traffic.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
