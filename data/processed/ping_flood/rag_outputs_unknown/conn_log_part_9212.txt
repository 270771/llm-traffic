Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or indicated as "-", which means the ICMP type is unknown or not type 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate other attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and volume.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP types.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other protocols.
