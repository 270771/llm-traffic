Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the 18th column (value 2 and 0 in the two entries). ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping). Here, the first record shows ICMP type 2 (which is "Echo Reply"), and the second record shows ICMP type 0 (also "Echo Reply"). Since neither record contains ICMP type 8, these are not ping requests and thus do not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP Echo Replies without corresponding Echo Requests; this could indicate misconfigured hosts or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- Check other logs or network telemetry for signs of different ICMP-based attacks or network scanning activity.
