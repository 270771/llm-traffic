Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicated; the Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP protocol but does not specify type 8, and the connection state is OTH (other), which typically means the connection did not complete normally. Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given this, no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in logs. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal ICMP traffic volume that could indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
