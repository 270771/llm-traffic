Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which indicate ping requests, are absent in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet.  
- The ICMP types present are 1 (Destination Unreachable), 0 (Echo Reply), and 13 (Timestamp), none of which correspond to ICMP Echo Request (type 8).  
- Since the key condition for a ping flood is a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The observed ICMP traffic could be normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 1 and 13 packets (e.g., 133.243.206.21, 133.243.171.99) to ensure these are legitimate network operations and not part of reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- If unusual volume or patterns of ICMP error messages arise, consider applying heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance once available.
