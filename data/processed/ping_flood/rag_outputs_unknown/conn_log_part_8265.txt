Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 or 11 (fields 4 and 10 combined indicate ICMP type and code, here the 4th field after source IP is 11 or 3 or 11, none is 8). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not represent ping requests and therefore cannot be part of a ping flood attack.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are typically related to network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic is generally classified as network diagnostic or error messages, not attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.101.171.237, 163.45.185.43, 133.227.58.122) for unusual volume or patterns of ICMP error messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would be indicative of a ping flood.  
- Collect more detailed logs or enable deeper packet inspection to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.
