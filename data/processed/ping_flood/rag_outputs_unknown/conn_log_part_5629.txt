Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 13. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 13 indicates "Timestamp Request," neither of which are used in ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomalies flagged, no immediate attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.125.201.18 and 202.250.216.227) for unusual ICMP activity patterns or volume over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
