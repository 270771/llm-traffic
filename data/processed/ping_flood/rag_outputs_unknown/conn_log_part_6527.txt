Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the field with value 0 after the destination port, which corresponds to ICMP type). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection states are "OTH" (other), and the flags indicate no established sessions or retransmissions typical of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP type 0 packets (Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of a reflection attack.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or abnormal ICMP volume from these IPs.  
- If possible, correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to detect other attack types.
