Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack patterns can be confirmed from this data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity, but this is not a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets for potential TCP SYN scanning or DoS attempts. Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.
