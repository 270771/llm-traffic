Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 from 112.201.24.37 to 163.45.16.238, which is an echo request (ping). However, the count of packets is very low (only 1 packet), and there is no indication of rapid or repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 157.206.153.123 to 54.203.14.148, which is not a ping request and thus cannot be a ping flood source.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo request and reply exchanges.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP echo requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume.
