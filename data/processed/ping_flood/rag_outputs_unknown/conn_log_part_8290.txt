Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 0 and 129, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and 129 is an ICMPv6 type unrelated to ping floods. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP traffic with types other than 8 suggests normal or other types of ICMP communication rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP Echo Replies (type 0) and ICMPv6 traffic (type 129) to ensure they are within normal operational parameters.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
