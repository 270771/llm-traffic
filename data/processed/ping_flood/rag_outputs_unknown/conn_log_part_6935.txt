Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry (timestamp 1641013212.322522) shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second ICMP entry (timestamp 1641013208.585973) shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the default assumption is that isolated ICMP Echo Requests are normal network behavior, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 packets if they persist, as they may indicate routing or TTL issues but are not related to ping floods.
