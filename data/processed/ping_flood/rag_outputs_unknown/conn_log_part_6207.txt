Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, not `8`. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the log shows type 0 (Echo Reply), this traffic does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume, there is no indication of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs showing a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns. Monitoring for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (80.61.201.56) to the destination (203.78.143.78) would be prudent to rule out early-stage reconnaissance or flooding attempts.
