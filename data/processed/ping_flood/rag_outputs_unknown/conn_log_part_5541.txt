Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and no ICMP traffic is logged here, no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some UDP queries, which may indicate scanning or normal traffic but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically (icmp.log or equivalent) to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods. Also, enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP type 8 traffic to catch ping floods early.
