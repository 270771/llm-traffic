Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.140.163 and destination IP 192.0.222.29 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, especially if multiple ICMP types or volumes are observed over time. Collect additional logs to determine if other ICMP types or patterns emerge that could indicate a different attack vector.
