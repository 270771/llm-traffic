Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All connections in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP-based, with no ICMP traffic entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The connections show typical TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN failures for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if available, focusing on repeated failed connection attempts from the same IPs.
