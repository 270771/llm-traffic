Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) only from two source IPs (133.243.77.163 and 133.243.172.24) targeting 44.202.236.101, but the volume is extremely low (each entry shows a count of 1). A ping flood attack typically involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the presence of ICMP type 8 alone does not indicate an attack without volume or pattern evidence.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential reconnaissance or scanning behavior.
