Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The S0 TCP state typically relates to incomplete TCP handshakes, often linked to reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.180, 89.247.69.146) for potential scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to detect any volumetric ICMP anomalies not visible in this snippet.
