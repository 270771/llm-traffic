Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP types are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood attack. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are not part of a different network issue or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for broader context.
