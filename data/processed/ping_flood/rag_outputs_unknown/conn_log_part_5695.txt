Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate an attack by itself. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are present, no immediate security threat is detected. However, further investigation could include monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 4.22.150.54 to 203.78.143.78 to detect potential future ping floods.
