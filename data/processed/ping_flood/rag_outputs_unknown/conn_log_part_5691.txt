Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types: 11, 10, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. There is a single ICMP type 8 record from 106.224.180.93 to 203.78.162.228, but it is a single connection with a duration of about 1 second and only 112 bytes transferred. This does not indicate a flood, which would show a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP echo requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. Investigate the ICMP types 10 and 11 traffic for potential other ICMP-based anomalies, such as unreachable or time-exceeded messages, which might indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.
