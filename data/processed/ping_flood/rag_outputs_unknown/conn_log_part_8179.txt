Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.203.247.100) within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013223.6). Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.102.174, 133.243.204.216, 133.243.204.251, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**.  
- Taxonomy class: **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 3.203.247.100 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.102.174, 133.243.204.216, 133.243.204.251, 133.243.253.35, 133.243.120.241, 133.243.253.119, 133.243.29.179, 133.243.69.131, 133.243.225.249, 133.243.213.85, 133.243.247.110, 133.243.120.193, 133.243.240.3, 133.243.136.236, 133.243.182.205, 133.243.29.118, 133.243.124.77, 133.243.73.146, 133.243.227.252, 133.243.177.105, 133.243.242.160, 133.243.182.122  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 3.203.247.100.  
2. Deploy or tune DDoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate ICMP flood traffic.  
3. Identify and block or quarantine the attacking source IPs if they are internal or known compromised hosts. If external, coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs for source filtering or blackholing.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or other related anomalies.  
5. Review and harden the target hostâ€™s ICMP handling policies, possibly disabling ICMP Echo Replies if not required.
