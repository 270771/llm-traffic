Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the snippet shows two entries. The first entry from 203.78.136.177 to 156.50.181.97 has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). The second entry from 173.20.80.35 to 163.45.128.163 has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets in high volume, these entries do not match the required pattern.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that ICMP types other than 8 do not indicate ping floods.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 packets in high frequency to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 11 or 0 packets, which may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance but are not ping floods.
