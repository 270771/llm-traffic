Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log snippet indicates ICMP protocol with no further detail on ICMP type. Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8 (Echo Request), this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood. Additionally, the connection state is "OTH" (other), and the packet and byte counts are zero, indicating no active data transfer consistent with a flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in logs. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from the source IP (2a02:dc70:6dc:f007:60:21:c173:1bb9) to the destination IP (2001:fcff:fa79:c0fd:e:7ff:fe1e:3a07) to detect potential ping floods.
