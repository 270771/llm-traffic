Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The entry shows ICMP traffic between 130.187.195.246 and 167.46.173.228, but without the ICMP type being 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another type of attack. Given the lack of explicit ICMP type 8 and no anomaly flags, no attack is currently detected.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing full ICMP packet details, including ICMP type and rate of requests, to confirm if any high-volume Echo Requests occur. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
