Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed ICMP traffic appears to be legitimate network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from the source IP 202.250.230.253 to destination 209.148.207.129. If a surge in Echo Requests is detected, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
