Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detected ping flood or related anomaly.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided TCP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN packets with no successful connections (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.  
- Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for any future ping flood attempts.  
- Establish heuristics for TCP scanning detection and update anomaly taxonomy accordingly.
