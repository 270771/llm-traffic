Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single record with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 59.90.223.254 to 203.78.202.158, but it shows only 1 packet with no signs of flooding (no high packet count or rapid repeated requests).  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.  
- ICMP type 8 traffic alone is normal unless it is high volume or sustained, which is not the case.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 59.90.223.254 if it starts sending multiple Echo Requests rapidly.  
- Check for other signs of network scanning or reconnaissance that might precede an attack.
