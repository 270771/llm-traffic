Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from IP 18.72.141.69 to two different destination IPs (203.78.132.69 and 203.78.132.74). While ICMP type 8 is consistent with ping requests, the volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a flood. The timestamps are very close but only show two requests, which is insufficient to conclude a flooding attack. The other entries with ICMP type 0 or other types do not represent ping floods, as per the rule that only type 8 is relevant.

No anomaly records are present to support suspicion of an attack. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests rather than a denial-of-service flood.

Next steps:  
Monitor for a sustained high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations or repeated requests to the same destination, which would be indicative of a ping flood. If such patterns emerge, investigate source IP 18.72.141.69 further.
