Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single instance without evidence of high volume or flooding patterns in the snippet provided.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets are part of a traceroute or other diagnostic activity, as they are not malicious by themselves.
