Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 69.232.167.15, from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.207xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," which is commonly classified under a Denial of Service (DoS) attack taxonomy.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources including 133.243.84.185, 133.243.78.10, 133.243.67.80, 133.243.4.131, 133.243.227.252, 133.243.56.118, 157.206.170.155, and others are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 69.232.167.15. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 69.232.167.15.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods.
  4. Engage incident response to assess potential impact on the target host and ensure availability.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
