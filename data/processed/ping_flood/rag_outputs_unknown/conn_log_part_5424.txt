Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets but no established sessions, which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN failures for possible scanning or reconnaissance activity. Specifically, review ICMP logs or packet captures to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests. If ICMP traffic is found, analyze ICMP type fields to detect any ping flood attempts.
