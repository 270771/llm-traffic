Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request), and no ICMP traffic is present, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means the traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. However, the traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Correlate with IDS alerts or other logs to confirm if this is benign or preparatory malicious activity. Monitoring for ICMP traffic separately is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
