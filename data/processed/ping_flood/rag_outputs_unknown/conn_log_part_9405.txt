Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the IP 69.232.167.15 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.198â€“202). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the target with ICMP requests to degrade service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #3 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Flooding").  
- Taxonomy class: "Denial of Service (DoS) - Network Layer Attack."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 69.232.167.15 (target of the flood)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.243.113.36, 157.206.141.203, 133.243.225.193, 133.243.205.212, 133.243.179.252, 133.243.8.142, 133.243.179.230, 133.243.71.19, 157.206.109.22, 133.243.205.213, 133.243.205.214, 133.243.225.199, 133.243.216.133, 133.243.115.115, 133.243.115.8, 133.243.113.129, 157.206.101.113, 133.243.93.134, 157.206.101.119, 133.243.210.166, 133.243.195.207, 133.243.93.153, 133.243.115.114.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 69.232.167.15.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from identified attacking source IPs if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further volumetric ICMP anomalies.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.  
6. Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing to prevent recurrence.
