Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is a single ICMP type 8 record from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.72, but it is a single connection entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known suspicious patterns or classifications apply here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern by correlating with additional logs or network traffic captures.  
- Consider checking for other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts if volume or patterns change.
