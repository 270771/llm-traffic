Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the heuristic for ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.
- The traffic shows multiple UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP) and various TCP SYN attempts, but none match the pattern of an ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced.
- The observed traffic could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity (e.g., repeated UDP packets to SIP ports), which should be investigated further.

Next steps:
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for potential ICMP flood attempts.
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic to port 5060 for possible SIP scanning or abuse.
- Apply heuristics related to scanning or reconnaissance once anomaly data is available.
