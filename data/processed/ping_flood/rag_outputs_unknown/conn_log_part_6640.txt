Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there is ICMP echo reply traffic without corresponding echo requests, as this could indicate misconfiguration or other network issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) from or to these IPs (112.115.140.242 and 133.105.121.194) to detect potential future ping floods.
