Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no relevant heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm no ping flood.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated Echo Requests from single IPs.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
