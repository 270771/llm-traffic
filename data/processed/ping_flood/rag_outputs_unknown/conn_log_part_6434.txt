Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 11th column) is 0 in the first record and missing in the second. For a ping flood, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request). Since neither record has ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 0 and other types to determine if it corresponds to other ICMP-based anomalies such as unreachable messages or other control traffic.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to identify if these IPs are involved in other suspicious activities.
