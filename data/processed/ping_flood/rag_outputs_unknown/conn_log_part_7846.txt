Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for traffic to be considered a ping flood.  
- In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8:  
  - From 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.10  
  - From 203.78.142.95 to 52.226.112.164  
- However, these are isolated single connection entries with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP type 8 packets indicative of flooding.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 10, 11) correspond to Destination Unreachable, Router Advertisement, and Time Exceeded messages, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. Given the data, no attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs at high frequency to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if unusual volumes are observed, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.
