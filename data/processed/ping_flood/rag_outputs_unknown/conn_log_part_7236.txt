Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic between 163.45.226.246 and 49.204.41.27 with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network issues or misconfigurations rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there are routing or firewall misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate future ping flood attempts.
