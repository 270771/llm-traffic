Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here only shows TCP connections.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as many connections show SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not ping floods.
