Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP packets are logged.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot match known ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no direct mapping can be made.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP type fields are logged.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- Enable anomaly detection rules focused on ICMP flood patterns to catch future attempts.
