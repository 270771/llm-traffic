Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 149.166.143.54 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for any unusual patterns or repeated ICMP type 11 messages, as excessive Time Exceeded messages could indicate network routing issues or traceroute activity rather than an attack.
