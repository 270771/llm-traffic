Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 1. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood attack, but neither entry has type 8. Type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 indicates "Host Unreachable" or "Destination Unreachable (Host)." These are not indicative of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed ICMP types suggest network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why these ICMP error messages are occurring; they may indicate network misconfigurations or connectivity issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
