Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to confirm or rule out ping flood activity.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any alerts related to ICMP anomalies or other DoS attack patterns.
