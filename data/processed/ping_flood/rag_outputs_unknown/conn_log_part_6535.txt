Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a response, not an attack initiation. Neither entry shows repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one destination in high volume, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 0 traffic are normal network operations and do not indicate an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood. Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests with increasing frequency or volume.
