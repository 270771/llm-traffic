Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, and none are observed here, this is not a ping flood. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is matched.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the traffic appears to be numerous failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state for potential port scanning or other reconnaissance. Correlate with IDS alerts or other logs to determine if these attempts are precursors to other attacks. Monitoring for ICMP traffic should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
