Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP Echo Request floods, and taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" for ping floods. Since this is a Timestamp Request, it does not fit that classification.

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of the ICMP Timestamp Requests from 210.162.64.199 to 89.247.66.53, as they may indicate reconnaissance or timing analysis. Monitor for any increase in volume or other ICMP types that could signal an attack.
