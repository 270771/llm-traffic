Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 0, and in the second entry is 11. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 11 is Time Exceeded, both of which are normal ICMP message types used in network diagnostics and error reporting, not indicative of flooding.  

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but by standard taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the hallmark of ping flood attacks.  
- Types 0 and 11 are benign or related to other network functions, not attacks.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP type 11 messages, which could indicate network issues or traceroute activity, but this is not an attack.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or other suspicious traffic patterns.
