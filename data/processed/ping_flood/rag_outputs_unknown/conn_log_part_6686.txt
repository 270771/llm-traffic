Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has type 128 (indicated by the Zeek conn.log ICMP type field), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, but not type 8 (ICMP Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of type 8 ICMP packets and no other suspicious indicators, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated connection attempts from the same source IP. If such patterns emerge, further investigation should focus on volume and rate of ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential flooding.
