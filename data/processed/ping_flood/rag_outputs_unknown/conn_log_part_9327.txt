Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be identified by protocol number 1, but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 (SIP signaling) from 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs is consistent with SIP scanning or possible SIP flood attempts, but this is not ICMP type 8 (echo request) traffic required for a ping flood.
- No ICMP type 8 packets are present in the log snippet, so no ping flood pattern is detected.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the best fit is that this traffic does not match the ping flood heuristic (which requires ICMP type 8).
- The UDP port 5060 traffic may warrant investigation under heuristics related to SIP flood or UDP flood, but this is outside the ping flood classification.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 on port 5060 to multiple internal IPs for potential SIP flood or scanning activity.
- Collect ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm or rule out any ICMP-based attacks.
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP echo requests to detect future ping flood attempts.
