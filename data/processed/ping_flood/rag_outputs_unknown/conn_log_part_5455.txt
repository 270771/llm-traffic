Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IPs.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related anomalies.  

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of relevant data.
