Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP address (35.83.191.13) targeting multiple destination IPs. All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The rapid succession and distribution of these ICMP Echo Requests to many different hosts strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristic and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection (excessive ICMP Echo Requests from one source) and fits the taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 35.83.191.13
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 35.83.191.13 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider about the abusive IP to coordinate mitigation.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future attacks.
5. Consider deploying ICMP rate limiting on critical infrastructure to reduce impact of such floods.
