Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, not 8, which means this traffic is not an echo request (ping) but likely an echo reply or another ICMP message type. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but without further data, no definitive attack classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 133.227.159.48 and 167.246.129.16 to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Collect additional logs to identify volume and frequency patterns that might indicate other ICMP misuse.
