Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 1 or 3, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for ping floods. ICMP type 1 indicates an ICMP Destination Unreachable message, and type 3 indicates ICMP Destination Unreachable or other error messages, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic detection for ping floods relies on high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 and 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based communication or errors.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
