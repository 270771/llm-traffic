Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a host.
- The anomaly CSV contains no records, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no related anomalies or heuristics can be referenced.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for unusual ICMP Echo Request rates or patterns.
- Continue to monitor TCP SYN flood or other DoS indicators, as many entries show TCP connection attempts with SYN flags but no established connections, which could indicate other scanning or DoS activity.
