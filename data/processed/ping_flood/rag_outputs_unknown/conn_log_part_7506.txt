Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Destination Unreachable messages are being generated between 203.78.136.16 and 193.96.13.51, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or other issues unrelated to ping floods.
