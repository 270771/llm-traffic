Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.141.148 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, and monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
