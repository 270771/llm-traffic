Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is no ping flood or related ICMP attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
- Consider enabling ICMP-specific logging if not already active.
