Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, the second entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods. There is no evidence of a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns such as sustained high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 18.73.129.47 for any unusual ICMP Echo Request patterns over a longer time window to rule out low-rate or intermittent ping floods. Also, review network baseline traffic to confirm normal ICMP behavior.
