Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without heuristic context, the default taxonomy for ping flood would require ICMP type 8 traffic, which is missing.

Next steps:
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs specifically for ICMP packets to confirm no ping flood is occurring.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP traffic volume.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Heuristic for ping flood typically involves detection of high-rate ICMP type 8 packets.
- Taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service" or "Network Flooding" under ICMP attacks.

No current attack is detected in the provided data.
