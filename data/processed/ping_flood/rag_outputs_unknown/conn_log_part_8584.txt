Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent rapidly from source IP 13.24.252.2 to multiple destination IPs (202.250.217.1, 202.250.217.210, 202.250.217.7). ICMP type 8 is the standard ping request, and the high frequency of these packets within milliseconds indicates a ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests" and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.24.252.2; Destination IPs 202.250.217.1, 202.250.217.210, 202.250.217.7; ICMP type 8; no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 13.24.252.2 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
  3. Investigate the source host 13.24.252.2 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
