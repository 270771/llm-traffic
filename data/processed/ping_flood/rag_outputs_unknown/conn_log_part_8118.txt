Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP type number, which is the 7th field after the source and destination IPs and ports. Here, the destination port is 0, and the ICMP type is not explicitly shown as 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate other attack types.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type codes. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 203.78.136.82 to detect potential future ping floods.
