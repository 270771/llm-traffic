Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and timing of these requests do not indicate a flood pattern. The timestamps are not tightly clustered to suggest rapid repeated pings from the same source to the same destination, and there is no evidence of overwhelming traffic or resource exhaustion.

No anomaly records are present to support suspicion of a ping flood or other attack.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, the default assumption is that ICMP type 8 traffic alone does not constitute an attack without additional indicators such as high frequency or volume.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from the same IPs, especially 133.227.242.217 and 133.227.132.249 targeting 52.222.245.10, as these could indicate early stages of a ping flood. If such patterns emerge, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection and classify accordingly.
