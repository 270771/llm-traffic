Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0 state) for possible port scanning or SYN flood attacks.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for potential ping flood detection.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify if these TCP attempts are part of a broader reconnaissance or DoS activity.
