Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with type values other than 8 (e.g., type 1 and 3), which are not indicative of ping requests.  
- Only two entries have ICMP type 8 (echo request), but these are isolated and do not show the volume or rapid repetition characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The entries with type 8 have normal connection states and no signs of excessive packet counts or durations that would suggest flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the default assumption is that no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 1 and 3 traffic, as these indicate destination unreachable or other ICMP error messages, which could suggest network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the IPs 133.243.206.29 and 133.243.173.85 to 184.184.140.104 and 42.155.76.169 respectively, as these could precede a ping flood.  
- Implement baseline traffic analysis to detect deviations in ICMP traffic patterns.
