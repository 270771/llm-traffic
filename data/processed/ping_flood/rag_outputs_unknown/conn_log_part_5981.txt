Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the logs show only single isolated ICMP packets (count = 1) from each source IP to different destinations, without evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The connection states are OTH (other) and flags indicate no retransmissions or floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific label. Since ICMP type 8 is present but no volume or pattern of flooding is observed, this traffic does not match a ping flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. If multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets are detected in a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate if these isolated pings are part of network scanning or reconnaissance activity.
