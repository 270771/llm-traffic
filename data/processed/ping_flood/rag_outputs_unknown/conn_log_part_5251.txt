Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All connections in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP-based (protocol field = tcp) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The absence of ICMP traffic excludes ping flood, and the TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 flag), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with S0 flags for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. This could be a precursor to other attacks and warrants further monitoring and correlation with IDS alerts or firewall logs.
