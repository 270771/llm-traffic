Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (fields 4 and 10 combined show type 0 or 1), but none have ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not represent ping requests and therefore do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to better classify any suspicious ICMP traffic in the future.
