Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 0 (fields 4 and 11 in the snippet), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that these ICMP packets are likely error messages (type 3 = Destination Unreachable) or Echo Replies (type 0), which are normal in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or repeated error messages that might indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or denial-of-service patterns once available.
