Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP echo requests from the same source IP (69.232.167.18) to two different destination IPs, with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood attack. The connection durations and packet counts are minimal, and there is no evidence of overwhelming traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood (which requires sustained, high-rate ICMP echo requests), no attack is detected.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from this source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, consider investigating if these isolated pings are part of network scanning or reconnaissance activities.
