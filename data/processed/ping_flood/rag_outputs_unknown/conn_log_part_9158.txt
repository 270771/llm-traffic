Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- The only ICMP-related field is the ICMP type column, which appears only once with a value of 8 in a TCP record (which is inconsistent and likely a parsing artifact). No legitimate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged.
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is observed, the condition for a ping flood (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) is not met.
- The traffic mostly consists of UDP packets on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling) and various TCP SYN attempts with S0 state (SYN sent, no response), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided.
- The observed UDP port 5060 traffic with many failed attempts could be investigated for SIP scanning or DoS attempts, which typically fall under heuristic categories related to protocol abuse or scanning.
- The TCP S0 states suggest reconnaissance or scanning activity, often classified under network scanning heuristics.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154 for potential SIP scanning or DoS attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging and anomaly detection rules specific to ICMP type 8 to catch ping floods promptly.
