Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, 11, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 record (timestamp 1641013231.300076) from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 133.105.58.55, but it is an isolated event, not a flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.  
- No high volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination are present in this snippet.  

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP Echo Requests rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for possible network issues or other anomalies unrelated to ping floods.
