Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 13 traffic is typically benign or diagnostic.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or frequency of ICMP type 13 messages that could indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based probing, but no immediate attack is evident from this data.
