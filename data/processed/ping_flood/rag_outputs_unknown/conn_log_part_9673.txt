Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack patterns can be confirmed from this data.
- The traffic mostly shows failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), which may warrant investigation for scanning or SIP-related abuse but is unrelated to ping floods.

Recommended next steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as it appears frequently and may indicate SIP scanning or abuse.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.
- Apply heuristics related to scanning or SIP abuse if available, as these connection attempts may fit heuristic classes for reconnaissance or protocol abuse.
