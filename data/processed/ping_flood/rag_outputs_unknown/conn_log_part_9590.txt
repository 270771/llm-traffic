Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, the volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a flood. The entries show isolated ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.254.197.94 to various destination IPs, but there is no evidence of rapid, repeated requests targeting a single IP or multiple IPs in a short time frame that would characterize a ping flood. Other ICMP types (3 and 1) are also present but are unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 8 traffic alone does not confirm an attack without volume or rate indicators.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from any single source IP. If a sudden surge of ICMP type 8 packets targeting one or multiple hosts is detected, re-evaluate for a ping flood attack. Additionally, investigate the purpose of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages for potential network issues or other attack vectors.
