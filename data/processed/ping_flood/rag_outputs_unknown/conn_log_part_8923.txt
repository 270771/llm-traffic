Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a victim IP.
- The anomaly CSV contains no records, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no related anomalies or heuristics can be referenced.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from single or multiple sources.
- If ICMP traffic is found later, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection, typically involving high packet rates and type 8 ICMP messages.
