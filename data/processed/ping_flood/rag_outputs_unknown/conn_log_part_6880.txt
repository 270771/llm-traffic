Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 8, 11, and 13. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic can indicate a ping flood. Here, there is only a single record with ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641013211.822195) and it shows a single packet (orig_pkts=0, resp_pkts=0), which does not match the high-volume, repetitive traffic pattern characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Other ICMP types present (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded, 13 = Timestamp) do not correspond to ping floods but may indicate normal network diagnostics or other benign ICMP activity.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession rules out a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency from the involved IPs (172.23.68.231 and 202.250.241.93) to detect potential future ping flood attempts. Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if network connectivity issues are suspected.
