Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "3" for both source and destination ports, which corresponds to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other connectivity issues, but they do not represent a ping flood attack.
