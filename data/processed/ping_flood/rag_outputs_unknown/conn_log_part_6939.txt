Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts without completion would fall under reconnaissance heuristics and taxonomy classes related to scanning.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion for potential scanning activity. Collect ICMP logs or packet captures to verify if any ICMP-based attacks occur outside this snippet.
