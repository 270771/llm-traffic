Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. The presence of numerous rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (143.187.187.183) to multiple destination IPs (163.45.254.197, 163.45.71.51, 163.45.70.194, 163.45.255.78) strongly matches the pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: Excessive ICMP Echo Requests**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Attacker/source: 143.187.187.183 (source port 8, ICMP Echo Request)
  - Targets/destinations: 163.45.254.197, 163.45.71.51, 163.45.70.194, 163.45.255.78
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 143.187.187.183 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on routers.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
