Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 record (151.105.96.5 â†’ 133.105.230.63) with no indication of high volume or repeated requests typical of a flood.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no classification can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 8 alone does not indicate an attack without volume or pattern evidence.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 if it starts generating multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for volume-based alerts.
