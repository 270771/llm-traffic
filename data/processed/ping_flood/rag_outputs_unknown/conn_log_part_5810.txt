Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans would fall under reconnaissance heuristics and taxonomy classes related to scanning or probing.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) for potential scanning activity. Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for any future ping flood attempts.
