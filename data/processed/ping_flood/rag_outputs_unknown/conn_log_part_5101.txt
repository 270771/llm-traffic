Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is observable here.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given TCP/UDP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning activity but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or packet captures directly to confirm absence of ICMP flood traffic.  
- Monitor for SYN flood or port scanning patterns given the many failed TCP connection attempts (S0 states).  
- Enable anomaly detection heuristics for ICMP traffic to catch ping floods if they occur.
