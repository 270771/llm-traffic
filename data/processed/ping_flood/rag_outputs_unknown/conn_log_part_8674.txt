Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single IP 44.202.236.101 from various source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds).
- ICMP type 8 is the echo request used in ping floods.
- The volume and distribution of these echo requests from multiple sources to one destination strongly match a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 44.202.236.101 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0 or not applicable)
- Source IPs: 133.243.7.240, 133.243.102.113, 133.243.161.190, 133.243.120.132, 133.243.156.255, 133.243.120.251, 133.243.87.237, 133.243.15.6

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 44.202.236.101.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service impact.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
