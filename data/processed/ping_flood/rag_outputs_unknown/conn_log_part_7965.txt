Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP Echo Reply packet from 203.78.143.78 to 146.203.89.6, with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is a normal ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match ping flood or other known ICMP-based attack patterns.

No immediate security response is required, but continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and types is recommended to detect any future abnormal patterns.
