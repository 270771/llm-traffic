Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, or enabling ICMP logging in Zeek to detect potential ping floods. Also, monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that may indicate scanning or other TCP-based attacks.
