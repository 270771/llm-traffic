Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries with protocol 17 (UDP) show destination ports around 5060 and other SIP-related ports, not ICMP.
- No entries indicate ICMP traffic (protocol number 1) or ICMP type 8 (echo request) which is required to identify ping floods.
- The logs show mostly TCP SYN scans (S0 state) and UDP traffic on SIP and other ports, which may indicate scanning or other reconnaissance but not ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed traffic pattern aligns with scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic to port 5060 (SIP) from 45.121.95.154 as it may indicate SIP scanning or enumeration.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes or type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture potential ping flood activity.
