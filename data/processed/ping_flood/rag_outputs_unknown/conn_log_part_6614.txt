Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 13, or other than 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the records show type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) and other ICMP types present to determine if they indicate other reconnaissance or scanning activities.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which could signal the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP type 8 traffic volume thresholds to detect future ping flood attempts.
