Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.113.54, 133.243.87.139, 133.243.220.59, etc.) all sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 44.202.236.101 within the same second (timestamp 1641013227.83xxxx). This pattern of many sources simultaneously sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting a single victim IP, classified under a Denial of Service (DoS) attack taxonomy.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range; destination IP: 44.202.236.101; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 44.202.236.101.
  2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
  4. Monitor network and host performance on 44.202.236.101 for signs of service degradation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if attack volume escalates.
