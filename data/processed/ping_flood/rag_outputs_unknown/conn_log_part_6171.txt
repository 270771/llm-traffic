Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 13 and 0, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 0 is Echo Reply, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the default assumption is that these ICMP types are normal or unrelated to flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume or rate of ICMP Timestamp Requests or Echo Replies, which could indicate other reconnaissance or timing attacks.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
