Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.
- The protocol field is either "udp" or "tcp"; no ICMP entries are present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not shown here.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 appears to be SIP signaling attempts, possibly scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is unrelated to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct evidence of ping flood or other attacks is found.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are given, no taxonomy class can be assigned.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood classification.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP attempts on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as these may indicate SIP scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods early.
