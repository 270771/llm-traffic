Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request) from 133.243.109.14 to 42.155.76.169 with 224 packets over ~3 seconds, which could be normal ping traffic but not necessarily flooding.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable) from 77.189.168.146 to 203.78.136.217 with 1103 packets over ~1.8 seconds. Since ICMP type is not 8, this is not a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, by definition, ping flood requires ICMP type 8 traffic at high volume, which is not conclusively present here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of ICMP type 3 packets, as this may indicate network issues or a different type of ICMP-based attack such as a network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
