Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from the same source IP (3.241.1.60) targeting multiple destination IPs (202.250.250.127, 202.250.250.123, 202.250.250.121) with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). The rapid succession of these echo requests to different targets is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-frequency ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks).  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 3.241.1.60  
- Target/destination IPs: 202.250.250.127, 202.250.250.123, 202.250.250.121  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from 3.241.1.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
- Block or throttle ICMP traffic from the attacker IP to prevent network congestion and service disruption.  
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or escalation.  
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and consider blacklisting the attacker IP if malicious intent is confirmed.  
- Review and update ICMP handling policies to balance legitimate diagnostic use and security.
