Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All provided Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is observed, the fundamental condition for identifying a ping flood attack is not met.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is available. The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity, as these may indicate other types of DoS or reconnaissance attacks. Specifically, analyze connection rates and source IP behavior for SYN flood heuristics.
