Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single target IP address (35.72.129.52) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013236.12xxxx).
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target, aiming to degrade its availability.
- The absence of anomaly CSV data and heuristic context requires assigning a likely heuristic and taxonomy based on standard knowledge:
  - Heuristic: High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood from multiple sources targeting a single victim.
  - Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Target IP: 35.72.129.52 (ICMP has no ports, but the field shows 8 for ICMP type)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.243.113, 133.243.81.217, 133.243.200.232, 133.243.215.153, 133.243.7.240, and many others from the 133.243.x.x subnet.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.72.129.52.
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or related anomalies.
5. Consider deploying anti-DDoS services or appliances if the attack volume escalates.
6. Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and apply appropriate blocking or blacklisting.

This targeted and rapid influx of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources confirms an ongoing ping flood attack.
