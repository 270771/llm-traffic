Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (last field before the count), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. The connection state is `OTH` (other), and the flags indicate no established session, which may warrant further investigation for unusual ICMP activity but does not indicate a ping flood.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 133.227.58.120 and 167.31.136.7 to rule out other ICMP-based anomalies or misconfigurations.
