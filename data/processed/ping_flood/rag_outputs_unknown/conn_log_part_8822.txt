Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.222.41.57) from many different source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-volume ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many IDS systems: "ICMP Flood Detection").  
- The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 52.222.41.57 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.227.214.160, 133.227.134.148, 133.227.64.254, 133.227.129.154, 133.227.180.249, 133.227.214.164, 133.227.129.145, 133.227.179.1, 133.227.179.5, 133.227.153.41, 133.227.214.147, 133.227.64.249, 133.227.129.135, 133.227.209.1, 133.227.134.78  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.222.41.57.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to apply traffic filtering or blackholing if the attack volume is large.  
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if not required for legitimate operations.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts among the source IPs and remediate accordingly.
