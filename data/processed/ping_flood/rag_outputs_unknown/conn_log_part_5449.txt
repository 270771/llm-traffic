Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs generating numerous TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts. Establish heuristics for scanning detection if not already in place.
