Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the source IP (e.g., `8` in the first two entries, `11` in the third). ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping).  
- The first two entries show ICMP type 8 from source IP 151.105.96.5 to two different destination IPs, each with only a single connection record and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests.  
- The third entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of a high rate or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single or multiple destinations, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. By default, ping flood attacks would fall under a heuristic related to ICMP flooding and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 151.105.96.5 is generating repeated ICMP Echo Requests over a short time window.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts for potential DoS activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Heuristic: ICMP Echo Request flood detection (not triggered here).  
- Taxonomy: Denial of Service (DoS) attack class.

No attack is currently present based on the provided data.
