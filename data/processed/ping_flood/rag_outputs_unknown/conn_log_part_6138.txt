Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 11, 8, 3, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. There is a single record with ICMP type 8 (from 58.142.235.227 to 203.78.197.162), but it is isolated and does not show the high volume or rapid repetition characteristic of a ping flood attack. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would fall under a heuristic related to ICMP abuse or volumetric DoS attacks, and taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service."

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs at high frequency. Investigate the source IP 58.142.235.227 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests in large volumes.
