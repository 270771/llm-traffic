Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is "3" (Destination Unreachable), not "8" (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 typically indicates network or host unreachable messages, which are normal control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is present.
