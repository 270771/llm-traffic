Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field = tcp). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated here. The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), many of which fail to complete, possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, TCP SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to detect volumetric ICMP anomalies.
