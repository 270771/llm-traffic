Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8, so it is not an initiating ping flood.  
- No high volume or repetitive ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would require multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession.  
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Monitor for spikes in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential flooding.  
- Verify if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations that could be relevant.
