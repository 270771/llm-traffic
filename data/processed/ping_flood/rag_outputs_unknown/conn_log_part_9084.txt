Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping) messages.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.201.7, 157.206.160.0, 133.243.162.30) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a small set of destination IPs (notably 18.46.237.125, 44.197.149.57, 52.223.127.239) in a very short time window (all timestamps are nearly identical).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a few destinations simultaneously is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target(s) with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomaly CSV or heuristic context is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources**.
- Taxonomy class: **Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.201.7, 157.206.160.0, 133.243.162.30, 133.243.225.196, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 18.46.237.125, 44.197.149.57, 52.223.127.239.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor affected hosts (e.g., 18.46.237.125) for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if attack volume increases.
6. Log and alert on continued high-volume ICMP Echo Requests for ongoing situational awareness.
