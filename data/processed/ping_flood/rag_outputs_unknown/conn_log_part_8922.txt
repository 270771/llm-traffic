Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 7 and 1, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 1 is an Echo Reply, and type 7 is a Reserved code, neither indicating a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 7 and 1 to ensure they are legitimate responses or benign control messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or abnormal traffic volume that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks.
