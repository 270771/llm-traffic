Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, two entries have ICMP type 8 (from 18.72.141.69 to 163.45.173.104 and 163.45.177.1), but the volume and timing do not indicate floodingâ€”there are only two such packets within a very short time frame, which is insufficient to classify as a flood. The third entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood heuristics look for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs.  
- Investigate if 18.72.141.69 is generating unusually high ICMP traffic over a longer period.  
- Check network device logs or IDS alerts for corroborating evidence of ICMP-based DoS activity.
