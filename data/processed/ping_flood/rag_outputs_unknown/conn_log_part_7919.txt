Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 62.131.18.60 for potential network scanning or traceroute activity, as ICMP type 11 is often generated during such operations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other unusual traffic patterns.
