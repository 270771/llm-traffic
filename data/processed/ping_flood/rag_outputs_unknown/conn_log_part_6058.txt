Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates ICMP error messages rather than a flood of ping requests. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type here.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific classification can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 typically relates to network troubleshooting or routing issues, not attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (61.112.31.14) to detect potential future ping floods. Also, investigate why ICMP Time Exceeded messages are being generated to rule out routing loops or misconfigurations.
