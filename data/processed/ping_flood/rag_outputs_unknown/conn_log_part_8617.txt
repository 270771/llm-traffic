Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from the involved IPs (200.129.49.40 and 203.78.143.78) and review additional logs for repeated ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
