Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The ICMP type 3 traffic could indicate network issues or scanning activity but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.105.128.252 and destination IP 2.79.151.99 for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious activity, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted.
