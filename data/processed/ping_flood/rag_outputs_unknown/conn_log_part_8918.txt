Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (all in the 157.206.x.x range) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (54.179.154.60) within a very short time window (timestamps all around 1641013229.97). This pattern of many sources sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting a single host, overwhelming its network stack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources including 157.206.141.203, 157.206.248.29, 157.206.145.149, etc., all targeting 54.179.154.60 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.206.0.0/16).
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (54.179.154.60) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with network teams to trace and block attack sources upstream if possible.
