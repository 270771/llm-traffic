Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.180, 89.247.69.191) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Collect ICMP logs or enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
