Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first entry (type 11) corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and the second entry (type 3) corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages. These ICMP types are typically related to network diagnostics or error reporting, not flooding attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, the presence of multiple ICMP error messages could warrant further investigation into network routing or connectivity issues.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP error messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or scanning activity.
