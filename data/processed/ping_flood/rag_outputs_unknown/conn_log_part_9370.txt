Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from different source IPs (157.206.227.126, 157.206.206.233, 157.206.195.131, 157.206.159.189, 157.206.143.249) targeting two destination IPs (69.232.166.26 and 54.183.178.87) in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomaly CSV or heuristic context is provided, assign heuristic number **H1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests**.  
- Taxonomy class: **DoS (Denial of Service) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Sources: 157.206.227.126, 157.206.206.233, 157.206.195.131, 157.206.159.189, 157.206.143.249  
- Destinations: 69.232.166.26, 54.183.178.87  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.  
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.  
4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.  
5. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering.  
6. Review and update incident response plans to handle ICMP flood attacks efficiently.
