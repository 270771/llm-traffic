Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.87.78.209) from multiple distinct source IPs within the same second (timestamp 1641013210). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.

Heuristic and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detectionâ€”high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 35.87.78.209 (ICMP type 8, no ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.227.129.153, 133.227.8.70, 133.227.219.8, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the field is 0.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.87.78.209.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
4. Monitor the target host for performance degradation and ensure logging is enabled for further forensic analysis.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host to reduce attack surface.
