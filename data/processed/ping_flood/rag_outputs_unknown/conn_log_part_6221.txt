Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but since ICMP type 11 is typically used for diagnostic or error messages, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or similar volumetric ICMP attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source of these ICMP Time Exceeded messages to ensure they are not part of a traceroute or legitimate network diagnostics. If these messages are excessive or correlated with other suspicious activity, deeper network behavior analysis should be conducted.
