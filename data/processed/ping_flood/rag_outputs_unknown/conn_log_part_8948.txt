Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various ICMP types. The critical condition for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Here, only one record has ICMP type 8 as the source port (46.108.125.224 â†’ 203.78.141.247), but the traffic volume (2000 bytes over ~19 seconds) and connection state (OTH) do not indicate a flood pattern. Other entries either have ICMP types other than 8 or no data volume, which disqualifies them as ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of repeated, high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic, this does not match a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic with type 8 for any unusual spikes over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from single sources to multiple destinations.  
- Check for other ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance activity, as some entries show ICMP types 0 and 11, which could indicate replies or time exceeded messages.  

Heuristic and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of data and no detected ping flood.
