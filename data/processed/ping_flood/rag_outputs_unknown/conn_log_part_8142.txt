Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. One has ICMP type 1 (which is an ICMP destination unreachable message), and the other has ICMP type 8 (an echo request, i.e., a ping). However, there is only a single ICMP type 8 entry with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be characterized by a large number of ICMP echo requests (type 8) in a short time frame from one or more sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP(s) to the same destination IP(s).  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential flooding behavior.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.243.206.29 sending the ICMP echo request to 23.50.50.249 for any unusual activity or repeated pings.
