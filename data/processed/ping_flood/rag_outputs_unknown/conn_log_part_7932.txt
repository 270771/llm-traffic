Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are sent from different source IPs (133.243.26.14, 133.243.67.1, 133.243.111.110, 133.243.112.250) targeting the same destination IP (174.95.41.114) within the same timestamp.
- This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target IP matches the classic behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target with ICMP Echo Requests.
- The presence of ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is available, assign heuristic number **H1** for "ICMP Echo Request Flooding" and taxonomy class **T1** for "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood".
  
Involved IPs and Ports:
- Sources: 133.243.26.14, 133.243.67.1, 133.243.111.110, 133.243.112.250 (all source port 0, typical for ICMP)
- Destination: 174.95.41.114 (port 8, ICMP Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 174.95.41.114.
- Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 174.95.41.114.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
