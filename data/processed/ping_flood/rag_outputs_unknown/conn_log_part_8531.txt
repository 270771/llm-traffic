Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 or 11, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries are type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

The observed ICMP types:  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded  

These types typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding with echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP error messages are unusually frequent, it may warrant investigation for network misconfiguration or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.142.122, 133.227.58.122, 203.78.136.177) for unusual behavior or scanning patterns.  
- Correlate with other logs to check for network issues causing these ICMP errors.
