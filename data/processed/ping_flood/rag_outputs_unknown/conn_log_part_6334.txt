Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the lack of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood, and the TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags but no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by enabling or reviewing ICMP-specific logs to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP echo requests or replies in future logs.  
- Review TCP connection attempts for possible scanning or reconnaissance activity, which may warrant heuristic 1 (Reconnaissance) if such context becomes available.
