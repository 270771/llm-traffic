Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

The ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are not related to ping floods but could be indicative of network issues or other types of scanning or misconfigurations.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types are frequent or correlated with other suspicious activity, further investigation into network health or potential reconnaissance might be warranted.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic volume spikes and review other logs for potential scanning or denial-of-service attempts.
