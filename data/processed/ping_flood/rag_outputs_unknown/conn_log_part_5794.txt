Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types. Only entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are relevant for ping flood detection.  
- Among the entries, only one record has ICMP type 8:  
  `1641013201.061630 37.87.125.169 8 203.78.162.46 icmp ...`  
- However, this single ICMP Echo Request does not indicate flooding by itself. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination. Other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded) are present but are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- ICMP type 11 traffic may indicate network issues or traceroute activity, not an attack.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 37.87.125.169 for unusual ICMP Echo Request patterns if volume increases.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
