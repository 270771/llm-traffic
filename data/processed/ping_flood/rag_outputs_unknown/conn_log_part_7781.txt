Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.89, which is an echo request (ping). However, the second entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 157.206.152.30 to 163.84.112.154.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The logs show only single or isolated ICMP packets.  
- No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs or network data show repeated ICMP echo requests that could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns to better detect anomalies in the future.
