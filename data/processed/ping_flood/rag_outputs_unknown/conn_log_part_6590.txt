Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by collecting more extended logs to check for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which would confirm a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.
