Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic with no specified ICMP type field, but the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood. Here, the ICMP type is missing or not indicated as 8, so it does not match the ping flood criteria. Additionally, the connection state is OTH (other), and there is no evidence of repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP packet data to verify ICMP types and volume. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP (2400:cb03:5be0:8ffb:ff8e:e02f:c12f:cbda) to the destination IP (2001:fcff:fb7d:bb05:a9d7:ea07:7e20:15d9) to detect potential flooding behavior.
