Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the log snippet are mostly 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 8 (Echo Request) only once. However, the single Echo Request (type 8) entry does not show a pattern of high-frequency or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests from one source to one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 sending the single ICMP Echo Request to 133.105.230.124 to confirm normal behavior.  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other ICMP types (e.g., type 3) are frequent and anomalous, consider investigating for other network issues or attacks such as network scanning or misconfigurations.
