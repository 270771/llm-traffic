Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as `-` (missing or unspecified), and the ICMP code is also `-`. Since the ICMP type is not explicitly 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8.

No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate why the ICMP type is missing in the log entry. Verify if ICMP traffic is being fully captured and parsed correctly. If further ICMP traffic with type 8 is observed at high volume, reassess for potential ping flood.
