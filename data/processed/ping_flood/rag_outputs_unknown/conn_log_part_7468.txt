Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is not ICMP type 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.152.29 and destination IP 67.46.8.11 for any unusual traffic patterns or repeated ICMP Echo Replies that might indicate other reconnaissance or network issues. Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods in the future.
