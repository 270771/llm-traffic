Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP Echo Request (type 8) entries in the logs or other signs of volumetric ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 133.227.58.120 to the destination 159.94.108.137.
