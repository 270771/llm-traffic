Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, many with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity, as these could indicate other types of network probing or attacks. Monitoring for ICMP traffic specifically would be necessary to detect ping floods.
