Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), and the second entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply). Neither entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for identifying a ping flood attack. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP types suggest normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in other logs or timeframes to rule out ping floods.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in ICMP error messages that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
