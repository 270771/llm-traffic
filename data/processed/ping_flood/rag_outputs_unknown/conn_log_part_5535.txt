Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connection attempts (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic entries. Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, there is no evidence of ping flood activity. The absence of ICMP traffic means the condition for a ping flood (ICMP type 8 packets flooding a target) is not met.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack patterns can be confirmed from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes, which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, and monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets. Also, review firewall and IDS logs for any alerts related to ICMP floods or other DoS attempts.
