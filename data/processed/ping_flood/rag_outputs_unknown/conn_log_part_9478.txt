Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP records show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the traffic volume and timing do not indicate flooding. The first record shows a single ICMP echo request with a duration of 0.006 seconds and 56 bytes, and the second shows a single echo request with a duration of 7.7 seconds and 112 bytes. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest otherwise.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If multiple rapid ICMP echo requests are detected, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate other ICMP types or protocols if suspicious behavior arises.
