Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are 128 and 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods. However, the first entry has type 128, which is an ICMPv6 Echo Request, not ICMP type 8 (IPv4). The second entry shows ICMP type 8 but only a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. There is no evidence of repeated or excessive ICMP echo requests from one source to one destination that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The lack of multiple rapid ICMP echo requests or large packet counts suggests no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 echo requests with high frequency or volume to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in connection states.  
- Collect more detailed logs or flow data to identify volumetric ICMP attacks if they occur.
