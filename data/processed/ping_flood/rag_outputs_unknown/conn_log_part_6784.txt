Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types. Only entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are relevant for ping flood detection. Here, there are two entries with ICMP type 8 (timestamps 1641013211.052265 and 1641013211.053750) from source IPs 133.227.208.174 and 133.227.218.183 targeting 35.87.78.209. However, the volume and frequency of these echo requests do not indicate a flood pattern; the log snippet shows isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a high-rate, sustained burst typical of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination. If a surge is detected, trigger alerts for potential ICMP flood. Also, investigate the sources 133.227.208.174 and 133.227.218.183 for unusual behavior or repeated ICMP echo requests over time.
