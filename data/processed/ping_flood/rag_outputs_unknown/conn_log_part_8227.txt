Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is represented by the source port field in Zeek conn.log for ICMP traffic, which is `11` in both entries. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded," not type 8 ("Echo Request") which is required for a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 3.03 (Destination Unreachable, Fragmentation Needed), also not type 8.  
- No high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is observed, nor repeated rapid ICMP traffic from a single source to a destination, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.120 and 133.227.58.122) for unusual ICMP error message patterns or other suspicious behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other ICMP types that could indicate reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Confirm if these ICMP messages are part of normal network troubleshooting or error reporting.

Heuristic and taxonomy: Not applicable as no ping flood or related anomaly is detected.
