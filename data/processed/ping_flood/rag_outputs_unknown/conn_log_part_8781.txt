Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `0` respectively, not `8`. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for a ping flood is repeated ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

- The first record: ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is a response message, not a ping request.
- The second record: ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is a reply to a ping, not an attack initiation.

No anomaly records are present, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.140.235 and 202.250.230.253) for other suspicious activity since ICMP type 3 and 0 messages can be part of network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other unusual patterns.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes with type 8, re-evaluate for ping flood.
