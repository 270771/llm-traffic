Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) packets all targeting a single destination IP (163.84.73.84) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time window (timestamps all around 1641013226.8). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target" and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs:
  - Victim: 163.84.73.84 (destination)
  - Attackers: Multiple sources including 133.243.218.243, 133.243.19.250, 157.206.34.242, 133.243.78.14, 157.206.164.253, and others.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 163.84.73.84.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
