Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from IP 203.78.143.78 to 95.5.248.250, but it appears as a single connection with a very short duration (0.050109 seconds) and only 32 bytes transferred, which does not indicate flooding.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 11 and 128, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination are present in the snippet.  

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be explicitly referenced. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets rules out a ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency or volume from the same source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or other ICMP types that might indicate different network issues or attacks (e.g., ICMP unreachable or time exceeded messages).
