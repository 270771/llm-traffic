Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types are 11, 0, and 13, which correspond to Time Exceeded, Echo Reply, and Timestamp, respectively. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations, as ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) can be part of network diagnostics or traceroute activities.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Consider enabling ICMP rate limiting or logging on network devices to capture suspicious ICMP traffic patterns.
