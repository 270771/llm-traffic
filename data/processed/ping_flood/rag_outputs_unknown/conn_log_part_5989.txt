Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 2 and 0, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the records have type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 2 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another anomaly.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If unusual ICMP error messages persist, consider deeper packet inspection or correlation with other logs to detect possible reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
