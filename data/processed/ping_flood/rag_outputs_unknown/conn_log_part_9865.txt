Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings). However, the volume and pattern in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two isolated ICMP echo requests are present, each with a single packet (`-` in bytes fields and `1` in packets). There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious indicators, this traffic does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity or if other logs show correlated anomalies.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP echo request spikes to detect potential future ping floods.
