Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have ICMP type values of 3, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 0 (Echo Reply), and 13 (Timestamp) suggest normal or other diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are not part of a misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, which would indicate potential ping flood attempts.
