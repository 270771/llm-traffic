Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 4th column after source IP) values are `3` and `11`, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectivelyâ€”not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the safest assumption is that these ICMP messages are normal network control traffic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate network issues or other types of reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If other anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP error message floods or network scanning.
