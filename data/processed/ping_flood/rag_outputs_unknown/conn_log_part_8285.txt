Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 133.227.159.6 and 165.31.148.123 to determine if it is part of a legitimate response or another anomaly. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect potential ping floods.
