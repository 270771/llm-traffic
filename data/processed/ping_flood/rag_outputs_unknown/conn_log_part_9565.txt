Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8, so it is a response, not an attack traffic.  
- No repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of type 8 ICMP packets means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if additional logs show a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP unreachable or redirect messages, which may indicate different network issues or attacks.
