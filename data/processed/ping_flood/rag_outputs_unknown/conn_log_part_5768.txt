Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP type 13 traffic could be legitimate network diagnostics or time synchronization attempts.

Next steps: Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 13 traffic is unusually high or correlated with other suspicious activity. Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
