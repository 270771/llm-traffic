Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from various source IPs within the 157.206.x.x range targeting a small set of destination IPs (54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.00xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession from multiple sources to the same targets is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood attacks is high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic targeting one or more hosts, aiming to overwhelm network resources. The taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" under ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 157.206.119.18, 157.206.225.234, 157.206.119.26, 157.206.100.169, 157.206.206.197, 157.206.241.1, 157.206.241.227, 157.206.100.207, 157.206.10.79
  - Destinations: 54.183.178.87, 69.232.166.26
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor network performance and logs continuously for further ICMP flood attempts or related anomalies.
  5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
