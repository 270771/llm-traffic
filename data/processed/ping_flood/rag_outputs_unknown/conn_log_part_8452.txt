Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.249.1.129) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The rapid succession of these echo requests to different targets within milliseconds strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source" and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.1.129; Destination IPs include 163.45.70.251, 163.45.70.210, 163.45.70.136, 163.45.23.77, 163.45.216.215, 163.45.69.1, 163.45.216.242.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.249.1.129 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
