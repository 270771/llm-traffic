Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic is mostly on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), and TCP connections show SYN attempts (S0 state) but no flooding pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The taxonomy for ping flood would be "Denial of Service" via ICMP Echo Request flooding, which is not observed here.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic on port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or SIP-based attacks.
- Monitor TCP SYN attempts for possible SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect ICMP traffic logs to verify if any ICMP-based attacks occur outside this snippet.
