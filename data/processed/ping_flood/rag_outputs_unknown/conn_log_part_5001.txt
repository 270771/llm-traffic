Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV.
- Without heuristic context, the default taxonomy for ping flood would involve ICMP Echo Request floods, which are absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate why no ICMP traffic is loggedâ€”verify if ICMP logging is enabled and functioning.
- Monitor for other types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods, as many connections show SYN sent but no completion (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN anomalies if available, focusing on repeated failed connection attempts from the same IPs or ports.
