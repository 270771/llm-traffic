Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 172.23.68.231 to two different destination IPs (203.78.183.6 and 133.251.182.205). However, the volume and pattern do not indicate a floodâ€”only two ICMP echo requests are present, which is insufficient to classify as a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 1, which are not type 8 and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of a few ICMP echo requests is normal network behavior and does not match known ping flood patterns, which typically involve a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets overwhelming a target.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP(s). If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, consider correlating with other logs or IDS alerts to detect broader attack patterns.
