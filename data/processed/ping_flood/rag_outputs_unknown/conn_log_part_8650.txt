Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 3 or 1, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion states that if the ICMP type is not 8, it is not a ping flood, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP types 1 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) typically indicate error messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages originating from 203.78.137.66 to various destinations. This could indicate network misconfiguration, scanning activity, or other issues worth further analysis. Specifically, review network device logs and routing configurations related to 203.78.137.66.
