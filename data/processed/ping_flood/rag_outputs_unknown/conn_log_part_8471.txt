Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP connections are targeting the single destination IP 54.196.70.79 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The connections occur within a very short time window (timestamps around 1641013226), indicating a high volume of echo requests from diverse source IPs.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 54.196.70.79 (ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are 0 or irrelevant).
- Source IPs include: 133.243.242.179, 133.243.85.62, 133.243.106.126, 133.243.92.228, 133.243.225.1, 133.243.81.197, 133.243.197.148, 133.243.106.218, 133.243.206.29, 157.206.237.109, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.196.70.79.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement; consider blacklisting or blocking these IPs upstream.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
