Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second ICMP entry shows a duration and size but the ICMP type field is missing or unclear; however, the ICMP code field is 9.017215 which is not a valid ICMP type. The ICMP type must be exactly 8 for a ping flood.  
- No repeated high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target are evident in the snippet.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The OTH (Other) state flags indicate irregular connection states but do not confirm a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by collecting more extended ICMP traffic logs focusing on ICMP type 8 packets and their frequency.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from single IPs to detect potential flooding.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for denial-of-service symptoms.
