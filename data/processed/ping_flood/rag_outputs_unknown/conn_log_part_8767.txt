Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic from a single source IP (3.243.126.119) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. This pattern—rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations." The taxonomy class is "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 3.243.126.119  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range  
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 3.243.126.119 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from other sources.  
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source IP and assess potential compromise or malicious intent.  
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if this is a recurring issue.  
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
