Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a length of 58 bytes but does not specify the ICMP type as 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but without the ICMP type 8, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type field in more detailed logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
