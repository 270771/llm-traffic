Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 0, and 3. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable. These do not indicate a ping flood pattern.  
- The traffic does not show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed ICMP types suggest normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate if ICMP type 3 or 11 messages are unusually frequent, as they may indicate network issues or other types of scanning activity.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
