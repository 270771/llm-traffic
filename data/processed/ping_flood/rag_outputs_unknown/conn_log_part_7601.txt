Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confirmed from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.134, 134.210.231.164) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood or ICMP-based attacks.  
- Establish heuristics for TCP SYN flood or scanning if relevant, as these connection patterns may indicate other DoS or reconnaissance attempts.
