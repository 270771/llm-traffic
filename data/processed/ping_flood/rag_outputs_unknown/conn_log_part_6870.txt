Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.213.130, 133.243.189.145, 133.243.113.5, etc.) sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 3.192.28.218 in rapid succession. This pattern of many hosts sending ICMP Echo Requests to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Attackers (sources): Multiple IPs in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.213.130, 133.243.189.145, 133.243.113.5, etc.)
  - Victim (destination): 3.192.28.218
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms these are ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.192.28.218.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting the same host.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and prepare to apply blackhole routing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
5. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary disabling ICMP Echo responses on the victim host to mitigate impact.
