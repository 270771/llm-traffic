Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood.  
- In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8: from 157.206.202.224 to 54.203.14.148 and from 157.206.157.225 to 54.203.14.148. However, these are isolated single connections, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a flood.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 3, 11) are present, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

No attack is present. The traffic does not match ping flood patterns, which require sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 packets. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IP, which could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages for potential network issues or other attack types.
