Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- All connections have protocol values 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP), and no ICMP protocol (1) entries are visible.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs or other Zeek logs (icmp.log) to confirm absence of ICMP echo requests.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
