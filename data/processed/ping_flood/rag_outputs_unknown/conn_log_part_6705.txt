Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.203.14.148 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013210.44xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target IP is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is:  
- Heuristic: High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination within a short time window.  
- Taxonomy class: ICMP Flood / Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:  
- Target IP: 54.203.14.148 (ICMP type 8 destination)  
- Source IPs: 157.206.159.32, 157.206.145.182, 157.206.167.234, 157.206.101.234, 157.206.101.143, 157.206.101.113, 157.206.82.204, 157.206.59.172  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:  
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter or firewall to mitigate the flood.  
2. Monitor the target host (54.203.14.148) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.  
3. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood protection mechanisms such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly detection on network devices.  
4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or participation in a botnet.  
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISPs of the source IPs to report abuse.
