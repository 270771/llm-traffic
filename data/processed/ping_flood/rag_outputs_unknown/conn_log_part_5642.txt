Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 11 messages are present between 154.137.193.126 and 203.78.143.78, as these may indicate network routing or TTL issues rather than an attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
