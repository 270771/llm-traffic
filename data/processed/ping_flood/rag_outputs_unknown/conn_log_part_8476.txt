Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223) within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013226.18). The volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple distinct source IPs to the same destination IPs strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where attackers overwhelm targets with excessive ping requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Targets: 163.84.73.84 and 44.198.161.223 (destination IPs receiving the flood)  
- Attackers: Multiple source IPs including 157.206.127.239, 130.187.239.3, 133.243.76.5, 157.206.66.253, 133.243.91.2, and others.  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and identify any new attacking IPs.  
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Alert affected system owners to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary ICMP blocking on affected hosts.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
