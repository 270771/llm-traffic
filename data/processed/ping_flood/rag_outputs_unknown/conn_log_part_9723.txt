Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values of 3 and 10, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. The traffic consists of multiple ICMP types but none are Echo Requests, so it does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are explicitly recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. However, ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages often indicate network scanning or misconfiguration rather than flooding. This should be investigated further by reviewing the source IPs (133.243.88.*) for potential scanning activity or network issues.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for scanning or reconnaissance alerts.  
- Verify if the destination IP 185.199.134.16 is experiencing connectivity issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages.
