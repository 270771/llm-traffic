Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 52.139.205.2 to 133.105.129.5, but it is a single connection with a duration of 0.55 seconds and 504 bytes transferred, which does not indicate a flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets are observed that would suggest a ping flood pattern.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of type 8 floods excludes ping flood attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages for potential network issues or other attack vectors such as reconnaissance or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) frequency to detect emerging ping flood attempts.
