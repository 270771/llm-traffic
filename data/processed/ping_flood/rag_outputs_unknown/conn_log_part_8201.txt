Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 203.78.143.78 to 181.23.135.253, with a single packet and 32 bytes, which does not indicate flooding.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.  
- No repeated or high-volume ICMP Echo Requests are present in the snippet, which is required to identify a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of type 8 ICMP floods excludes ping flood attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types that may indicate other network issues or attacks.
