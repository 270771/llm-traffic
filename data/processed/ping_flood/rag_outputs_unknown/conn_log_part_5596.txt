Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic in the log shows a connection with ICMP type field missing or unspecified (indicated by "-" in the relevant fields), and the ICMP type is not explicitly 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the connection state "OTH" (other) and flags do not indicate a typical flood or scanning pattern.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and rates. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume from 133.227.58.122 to 51.91.115.202 to detect potential flooding.
