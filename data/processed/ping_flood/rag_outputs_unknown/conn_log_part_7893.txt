Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the port field being 0), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets with type other than 8, possibly Echo Replies or other ICMP message types.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
