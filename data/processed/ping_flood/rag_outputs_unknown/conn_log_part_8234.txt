Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 107.102.62.64 from different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Sources 130.187.192.48, 130.187.195.145, 130.187.233.57, 130.187.26.34, 130.187.49.50 are all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 107.102.62.64. Ports are 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs.
  2. Monitor the target host 107.102.62.64 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the attack traffic.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
