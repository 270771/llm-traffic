Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.73.129.47) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages, the core of a ping flood attack.
- The rapid succession of these Echo Requests to many different targets within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641013228.5xx) matches the known pattern of a ping flood, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 18.73.129.47
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- ICMP code: 0
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the log shows ICMP protocol.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 18.73.129.47 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
