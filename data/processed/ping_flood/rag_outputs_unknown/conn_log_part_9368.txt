Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) from a variety of source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all at 1641013233.xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession from multiple sources to the same targets matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the traffic fits the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single or few targets," which is commonly classified under the taxonomy of "ICMP Flood / Ping Flood Denial of Service."
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 157.206.255.134, 157.206.74.179, 157.206.203.143, 157.206.161.8, 157.206.242.151, 157.206.89.154, 157.206.242.129
  - Destinations: 54.183.178.87, 69.232.166.26
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to reduce the flood impact.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  4. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic if the volume is large.
  5. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within your network or external attackers.
