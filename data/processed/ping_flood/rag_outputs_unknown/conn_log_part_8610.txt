Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show failed TCP handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, often classified under network scanning or probing taxonomy.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts for potential scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs to detect any possible ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review existing ICMP monitoring rules to capture Echo Requests (type 8) for future detection.
