Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (157.206.73.174, 157.206.119.26, 157.206.156.30, 157.206.82.208, 157.206.5.99) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (3.199.185.249) within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.206.73.174, 157.206.119.26, 157.206.156.30, 157.206.82.208, 157.206.5.99; Destination - 3.199.185.249; Port is not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs.
  2. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to block or mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.
  3. Monitor the target host (3.199.185.249) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
