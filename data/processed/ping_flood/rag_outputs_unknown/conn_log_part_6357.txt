Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type values are 0, 3, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that these ICMP types correspond to normal or other diagnostic/error messages (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded).

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential other ICMP-based issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping floods.  
- If ICMP type 3 or 11 traffic is unusually high, consider checking for network routing or connectivity problems.
