Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting primarily the IP 174.95.41.114 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013220.33xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where the attacker overwhelms the target with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target" typically labeled as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack under the taxonomy class "Network Flooding" or "ICMP Flood."  
- Assigning heuristic number: 1 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection).  
- Taxonomy class: "ICMP Flood / Ping Flood" under DoS attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 174.95.41.114 (primary target receiving the flood).  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.103.86, 157.206.123.8, 157.206.249.220, 157.206.21.6, 157.206.118.10, 157.206.123.120, 157.206.12.129, 157.206.160.220, 157.206.147.0, 157.206.194.43, 157.206.216.143, 157.206.216.221, 157.206.142.60, 157.206.0.155, 157.206.40.144, 157.206.12.163, 157.206.21.97, and others.  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).  
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.  
4. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.  
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics for future attacks.
