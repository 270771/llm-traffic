Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 11, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. There is a single record with ICMP type 8 (from 119.255.136.125 to 202.250.202.5), but it is an isolated event with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not correspond to ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks fall under a Denial of Service (DoS) taxonomy and would be flagged by heuristics detecting high-rate ICMP Echo Requests.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at a high frequency. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood DoS attacks. Also, review network traffic volume and rate metrics to detect volumetric anomalies.
