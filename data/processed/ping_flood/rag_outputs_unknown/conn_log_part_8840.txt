Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 3, 11, and 8. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood traffic. Here, only one entry has type 8, and it is a single connection with no evidence of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not correspond to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession suggests no flooding pattern.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 entry further to confirm it is benign (e.g., normal ping or network diagnostic).  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Consider correlating with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify any emerging ICMP-based attacks.
