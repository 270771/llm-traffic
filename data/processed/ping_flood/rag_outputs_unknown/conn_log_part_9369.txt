Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 203.78.143.78 to 193.150.93.1 with a single packet and low duration (0.200237 seconds), which does not indicate flooding.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 13, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a destination, which is characteristic of ping flood attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets or sustained traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types that may indicate other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
