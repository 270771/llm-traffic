Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows a connection with 96 packets over ~2 seconds, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given; the Zeek conn.log does not directly show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) in these entries.  
- The second ICMP record has a packet count of 1 and no duration or packet count indicating flooding. Also, the ICMP type is not explicitly stated as 8.  
- According to the instruction, only ICMP type 8 traffic can be considered ping floods. Since no ICMP type 8 is present or indicated, no ping flood is detected.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated in the snippet. The connection states are OTH (other), which is common for ICMP traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Further investigation could include:  
- Extracting ICMP type details from raw packet captures or more detailed logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitoring for sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.
