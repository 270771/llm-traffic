Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet have an ICMP type of 11 or other values, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since the fundamental condition for a ping flood (ICMP type 8) is not met, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The ICMP types observed (such as 11, which is Time Exceeded) typically indicate diagnostic or error messages rather than flooding or attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP error messages, as excessive ICMP errors can indicate network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic specifically to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other suspicious activity is detected, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for comprehensive analysis.
