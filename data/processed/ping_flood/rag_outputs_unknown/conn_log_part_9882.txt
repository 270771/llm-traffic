Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.72.129.52) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641013236.12). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is "ICMP Flood Detection" (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.243.x.x range (e.g., 133.243.210.150, 133.243.210.155, 133.243.210.178, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.72.129.52 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
  3. Monitor the target host (35.72.129.52) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack traffic.
