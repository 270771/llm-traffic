Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP entries are logged here, there is no evidence of a ping flood. The absence of ICMP traffic means the traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the traffic shows multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN flags set (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate further by reviewing ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods. Also, monitor for TCP SYN scan heuristics if suspicious connection attempts persist.
