Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP connections in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm the target with echo requests, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, ICMP type 3 traffic often indicates network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.229.227 for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior, as it is sending multiple ICMP type 3 messages to various destinations. Monitoring for unusual ICMP error message volumes or correlating with other logs could clarify if this is benign or part of a different attack vector.
