Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11, 1, and 3. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries match the criteria for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Type 11 = Time Exceeded  
- Type 1 = ICMP Destination Unreachable (or possibly Echo Reply depending on context, but here likely unreachable)  
- Type 3 = Destination Unreachable  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references can be made. However, based on standard ICMP type definitions, these packets do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or error conditions.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If suspicious activity continues, enable more detailed logging or IDS rules focused on ICMP Echo Requests and rate anomalies.
