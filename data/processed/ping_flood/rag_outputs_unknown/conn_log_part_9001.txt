Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 107.102.62.64 from different source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Sources include 130.187.228.179, 130.187.193.5, 130.187.193.6, 130.187.229.82, 130.187.19.246, 130.187.19.214, and 130.187.193.119. The target IP is 107.102.62.64. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), port fields are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 107.102.62.64.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  5. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
