Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets originating from a single source IP (133.243.5.1) targeting multiple destination IPs with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The rapid succession of these echo requests to different targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern, aiming to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source" and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.243.5.1; Destination IPs include 95.211.133.106, 82.230.32.236, 45.191.213.229, 195.74.108.148, and 192.167.101.117. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.243.5.1 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this or other sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules in IDS/IPS systems to alert on similar patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for potential compromise or misuse.
