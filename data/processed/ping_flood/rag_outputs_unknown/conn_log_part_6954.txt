Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is represented by the 8th column (counting from 1), which shows values such as 0, 1, 13, and 0 again, but never 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries have type 8, these packets are not ping requests and therefore do not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with types 0 (Echo Reply), 1 (Destination Unreachable), and 13 (Timestamp Request) to ensure they are legitimate and not part of other reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Monitoring for unusual volume or patterns in these ICMP types could be warranted.
