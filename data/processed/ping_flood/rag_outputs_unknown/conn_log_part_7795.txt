Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 8 (Echo Request). Only ICMP type 8 packets are relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the type 8 packets from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.52 and 133.105.230.53 are single occurrences with zero recorded packets or bytes, indicating no flood or high volume. The type 3 packets from 130.187.20.23 to 195.99.225.39 are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of isolated ICMP Echo Requests without volume or repetition does not meet typical ping flood criteria (high-rate ICMP Echo Requests).

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if these hosts generate repeated ICMP Echo Requests over time, which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance rather than flooding.
