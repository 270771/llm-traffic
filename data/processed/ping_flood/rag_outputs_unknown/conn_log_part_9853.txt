Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would be identifiable by protocol number 1 (ICMP), but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only UDP (protocol 17) and TCP (protocol 6) traffic.
- No entries indicate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to confirm a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060 appears repeatedly but is not ICMP and thus unrelated to ping floods.
- The TCP entries show single SYN attempts (S0 state) with no flooding pattern or ICMP involvement.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154, as it may indicate SIP-related scanning or UDP flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect potential ping floods in future monitoring.
