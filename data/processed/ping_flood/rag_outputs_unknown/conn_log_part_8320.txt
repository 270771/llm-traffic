Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11, but only the first entry has type 8 (Echo Request) and it is a single connection with no indication of flooding (no high frequency or volume). The other entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ping flood attacks require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.45.108.104 sending ICMP type 8 to 139.93.218.236 for any unusual patterns over time.  
- Check for other types of ICMP-based attacks or network issues indicated by types 3 and 11.
