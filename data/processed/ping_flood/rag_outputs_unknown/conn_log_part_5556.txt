Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The connections are mostly TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts, but not ICMP flooding.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is detected, no ping flood heuristic applies.
- The observed traffic may indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity (TCP SYN scans), which typically fall under heuristics related to network scanning or reconnaissance.
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the next step is to investigate these TCP SYN attempts for potential scanning or intrusion attempts.

Next Steps:
- Monitor for repeated SYN attempts from the same IPs to identify scanning patterns.
- Correlate with IDS/IPS alerts for scanning or brute force attempts.
- Capture ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
