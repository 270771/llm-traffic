Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to an ICMP timestamp request, not an echo request (type 8) used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection behavior but is not sufficient to classify this as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature and frequency of ICMP type 13 traffic between 163.45.185.120 and 185.145.15.196 to determine if it is part of a reconnaissance or timing-based attack. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood.
