Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show protocol 11 (ICMP) but the ICMP type field is missing or indicated as 0, not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection states are OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but not necessarily an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why these ICMP packets have type 0 or missing type fields. Verify if these are malformed packets or part of another ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messaging activity. Monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded) could be relevant if further anomalies arise.
