Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `11`, not `8`. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 11 is Time Exceeded, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity related to these IPs or ports. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the safest assumption is that these entries represent normal ICMP error or control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is an unusual volume of ICMP type 3 or 11 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP error message floods or reconnaissance activity.
