Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is a response to a ping rather than an attack generating excessive ping requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Since the traffic is ICMP Echo Reply, it does not match known ping flood patterns.

No immediate attack is detected, but monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP (218.73.175.208) would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
