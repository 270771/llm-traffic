Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 0 and 1, not 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 0 is Echo Reply, and type 1 is typically Destination Unreachable or other control messages, which are not indicative of ping floods.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without explicit heuristics, the absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 1 packets (code 3 or others) to determine if these indicate network issues or other ICMP-based reconnaissance or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for broader network anomaly detection.
