Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 0, 3, and 11. None have ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Specifically:  
- Type 11 (Time Exceeded) from 150.227.97.96 to 163.84.16.166  
- Type 10 (Router Advertisement) from 203.78.135.66 to 5.131.34.9  
- Type 1 (Destination Unreachable) from 203.78.134.15 to 109.15.134.119  

Since no ICMP echo requests (type 8) are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 1, 10, and 11 often relate to network diagnostics or error messages rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP error messages to ensure they are legitimate and not part of a reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.
