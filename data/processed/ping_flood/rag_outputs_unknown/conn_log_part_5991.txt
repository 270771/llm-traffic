Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 3 or other than 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries have type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 messages (Destination Unreachable) seen here, as multiple such messages could indicate network misconfigurations or other issues worth examining.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
