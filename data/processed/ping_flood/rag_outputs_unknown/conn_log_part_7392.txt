Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, not type 8 which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 indicates "Echo Reply," neither of which constitute a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic does not match ping flood criteria, no heuristic or taxonomy assignment is applicable.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as they may indicate network misconfigurations or other connectivity issues. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
