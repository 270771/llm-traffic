Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is the 7th column, here showing values 0, 128, 3, 11). Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of these entries are type 8, this traffic does not represent a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded, type 128 = Echo Request in IPv6 but here likely a different interpretation or a mismatch).

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as these can indicate network issues or scanning activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal a future ping flood. If possible, correlate with other logs or alerts to detect reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
