Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0 or 3 (indicated by the 7th field after source/dest IPs and ports, which is 0 or 3, not 8). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), none of these entries correspond to ping requests. Therefore, no ping flood pattern is present.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection rules specifically targeting ICMP Echo Requests to catch future ping floods promptly.
