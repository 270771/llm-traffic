Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the connection state is "OTH" (other), and the packet counts are very low (only 1 packet each), indicating no high-volume or sustained traffic typical of a ping flood attack. There is no evidence of rapid or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination that would indicate flooding.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific label.

Next steps: Monitor for increased volume or frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs. If a sudden surge in ICMP Echo Requests occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate why these ICMP packets are marked as "OTH" state, which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection tracking.
