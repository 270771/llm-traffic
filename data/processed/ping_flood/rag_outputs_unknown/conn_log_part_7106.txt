Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Ping floods involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP Echo Replies are observed without corresponding Echo Requests in the logs, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request traffic (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
