Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP types observed are 1 (Destination Unreachable), 13 (Timestamp), and 0 (Echo Reply). Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 1 and 13 traffic may indicate other network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 1 and 13 messages to ensure they are legitimate network operations and not part of a reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.
