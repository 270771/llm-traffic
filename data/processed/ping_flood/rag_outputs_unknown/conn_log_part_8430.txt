Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 0, 9, and 11, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Specifically:  
- Entry 1: ICMP type 9 (Router Advertisement)  
- Entry 2: ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded)  
- Entry 3: ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded)  

Since the ICMP type is not 8 in any record, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned here. However, ICMP types 9 and 11 are typically related to network diagnostics or routing, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, as repeated ICMP type 11 messages could indicate network issues or traceroute activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- If anomalies appear in other logs or with additional context, re-evaluate for potential ICMP-based attacks.
