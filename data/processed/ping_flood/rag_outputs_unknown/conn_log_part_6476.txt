Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field indicated by the 4th and 6th columns (values 11 and 0 respectively). ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, and type 0 corresponds to "Echo Reply." Neither entry shows ICMP type 8, which is required for an ICMP Echo Request (ping) and thus for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, based on standard taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.  
- ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) alone does not indicate an attack without corresponding Echo Requests.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.243.19.170 and 133.227.58.120) for unusual ICMP activity patterns or volume over time.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets which would indicate potential ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for possible reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
