Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the connection durations are very short (0.049063 seconds and unspecified), and the packet counts are minimal (32 bytes in one entry, no data in the other). There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP packets are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign traffic.  
- If a sudden spike in ICMP traffic occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
