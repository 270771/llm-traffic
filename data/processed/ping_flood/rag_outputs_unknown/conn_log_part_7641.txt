Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values as "-" (unknown or not specified) except one entry with ICMP type 84, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious behavior related to ICMP ping floods or other attacks.

Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no heuristic or taxonomy class applies here for ping flood detection.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type 84 packet further to identify its nature, as it is unusual and not a standard Echo Request. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
