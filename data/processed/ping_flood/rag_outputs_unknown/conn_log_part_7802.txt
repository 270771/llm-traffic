Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 8. According to the given rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, one entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not a ping flood indicator. The other entry has ICMP type 8, but there is only a single record with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets means this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood or DoS activity. Also, review other logs or network monitoring tools for volumetric ICMP traffic spikes.
