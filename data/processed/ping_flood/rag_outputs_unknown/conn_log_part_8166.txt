Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and no ICMP entries are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs generating numerous failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity. Collect ICMP logs specifically to monitor for ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
