Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.
- There is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The protocol field shows only "udp" and "tcp" with no ICMP entries.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connection attempts appear to be mostly failed or incomplete TCP/UDP sessions (S0 state), which could be scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, S0 states in Zeek conn.log correspond to failed connection attempts, often linked to reconnaissance (heuristic: scanning detection, taxonomy: reconnaissance).

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts (e.g., 45.121.95.154) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious UDP/TCP traffic.
