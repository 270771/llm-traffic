Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.
- ICMP traffic would be indicated by protocol number 1, and the ICMP type field would be present to identify type 8 (echo request) for ping floods.
- Here, protocols are UDP (17) and TCP (6) only; no ICMP entries are present.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple 133.105.x.x addresses on port 5060, which may indicate SIP scanning or UDP flood attempts.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable logging or alerts specifically for ICMP type 8 packets to catch ping flood attempts early.
