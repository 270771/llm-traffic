Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, there is only a single ICMP Echo Request from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.196, not a flood or high volume of requests. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no sustained or repeated ICMP Echo Requests are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual ICMP traffic volumes.
