Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic may indicate other network issues or benign ICMP error messages but does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 1 messages to determine if there are underlying network connectivity or routing issues. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
