Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 52.222.41.57 from different source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps differ by milliseconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches the common heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single host" typically classified under "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks in anomaly taxonomies.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Targets: 52.222.41.57 (destination IP receiving the flood)
  - Sources: 133.227.156.210, 133.227.113.127, 133.227.179.0, 133.227.134.29 (all sending ICMP type 8)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.222.41.57.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor network traffic for additional sources and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IPs.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.
