Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 133.243.18.106 to 167.246.129.99 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows traffic from 161.216.247.5 to 203.78.135.92 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single packet with no indication of flooding or high volume.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 traffic if unusual, as it may indicate network issues or traceroute activity but is not an attack.
