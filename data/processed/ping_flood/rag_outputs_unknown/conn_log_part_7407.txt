Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values of 0 or 3, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, none of these entries indicate ping flood traffic.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 3 = Destination Unreachable) suggest normal or error-related ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential misconfigurations or network issues causing ICMP errors.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data once available.
