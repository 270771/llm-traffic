Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks rely on ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood.  

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly TCP connection attempts, many with SYN flags set but no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.

Recommendation:  
Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeekâ€™s conn.log does not show ICMP by default. Enable ICMP logging or review ICMP-specific logs to detect ping floods. Also, monitor for TCP scanning or SYN flood patterns given the many SYN-only connections here.  

Heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
