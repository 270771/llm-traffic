Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP echo request packets (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 11 indicates "Time Exceeded," which are control messages rather than echo requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the safest assumption is that these ICMP messages are normal network control traffic or possibly indicative of other network issues, but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs (157.206.119.22, 112.13.144.173, 202.250.230.253, 193.96.13.31) for any unusual patterns or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
