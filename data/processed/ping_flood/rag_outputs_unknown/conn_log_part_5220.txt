Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since no ICMP traffic is logged, and specifically no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are observed, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports that no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.
- The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood. The heuristic for ping flood requires ICMP Echo Requests at high volume.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN failures (S0) for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scan detection and monitor for repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
