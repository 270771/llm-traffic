Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no indication of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts without completion would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, often taxonomy class "Network Scanning."

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts (e.g., 45.121.95.154 on UDP port 5060) for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity. Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for possible ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
