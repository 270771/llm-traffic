Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column (counting from 1), which shows values 11, 3, 8, and 3 for the four entries. Only the third entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request recorded, not a high volume or flood of such packets. The other ICMP types (11 and 3) correspond to Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable messages, which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of multiple ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious patterns, this traffic does not match a ping flood attack.

If further investigation is warranted, focus should be on the ICMP type 8 traffic from source IP 222.135.78.24 to destination IP 133.105.182.174, verifying if this echo request is part of a larger pattern or isolated. Monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests would be the next step.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
