Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry has ICMP type 8, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is necessary to identify a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) attack heuristic, often labeled as "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" in anomaly taxonomies.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential flooding behavior.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or related alerts from IDS/IPS systems.
