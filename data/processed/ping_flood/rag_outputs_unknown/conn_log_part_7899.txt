Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has a type field of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is related to traceroute or TTL expiration rather than a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic typically does not indicate an attack but normal network diagnostic or routing behavior.

No immediate security incident is detected here. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic for excessive Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential ping floods in the future.
