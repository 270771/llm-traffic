Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "11," which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why there are ICMP Time Exceeded messages between 202.250.202.133 and 177.92.165.147, as this could indicate routing loops or network misconfigurations. Monitoring for increased volume or other ICMP types may be warranted.
