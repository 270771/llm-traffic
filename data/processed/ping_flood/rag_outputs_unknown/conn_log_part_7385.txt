Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP code field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of ICMP Echo Requests and no anomalies, no ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP (203.78.140.213) to the destination (39.107.201.175) to rule out stealthy ping floods or other ICMP misuse.
