Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), but no clear signs of flooding or scanning patterns are evident. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack classifications.

Next steps: Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks. Also, monitor for unusual volumes of SYN packets or other connection attempts that might indicate scanning or DoS attempts. Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
