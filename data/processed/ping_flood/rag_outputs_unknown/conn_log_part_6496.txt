Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 or 11 (the 4th field after source IP), none have type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required for a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. The connection states are all "OTH" (other), and no anomalies are reported in the anomaly CSV. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific alternative attack classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent other ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messages (e.g., type 11 is Time Exceeded). Monitoring for volume spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) should continue to detect potential future ping floods.
