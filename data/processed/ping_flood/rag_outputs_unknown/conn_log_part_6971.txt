Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with ICMP types 3, 1, and 0 respectively. None of these are ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type used in ping floods. Since the key indicator for a ping flood is a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

The observed ICMP types correspond to:  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
- Type 1: Host Unreachable (or possibly an ICMP error message)  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping flood attempts.
