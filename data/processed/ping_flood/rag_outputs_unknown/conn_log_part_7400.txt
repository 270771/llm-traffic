Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out before Zeek processing.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect future ping floods.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.
- Continue monitoring TCP/UDP anomalies, as some entries show many TCP connection attempts with SYN flags but no established sessions, which could indicate scanning or other reconnaissance activity.
