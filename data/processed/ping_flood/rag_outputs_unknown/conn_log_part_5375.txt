Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans correspond to reconnaissance heuristics and taxonomy classes related to scanning or probing.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to confirm if scanning or other attacks are occurring.
