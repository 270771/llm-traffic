Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values are 0, 129, 0, and 10, none of which correspond to the Echo Request type (8) required for a ping flood attack. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, since the traffic is ICMP but not Echo Requests, it may represent other ICMP activity such as error messages or informational messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 0, 10, and 129 in this environment to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another attack vector (e.g., ICMP unreachable or router advertisement messages).  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
