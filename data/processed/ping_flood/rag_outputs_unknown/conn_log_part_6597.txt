Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 0, 2, and 3, but none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 clearly excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 2 (Source Quench) messages, as these can indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
