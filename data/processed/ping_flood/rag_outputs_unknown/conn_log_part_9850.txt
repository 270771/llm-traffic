Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 (as indicated by the 4th and 6th fields: 11 and 0, or 3 and 1), none have ICMP type 8, which is the Echo Request type required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets (types 0 and 1 correspond to Echo Reply and Destination Unreachable or other control messages) to ensure they are legitimate and not part of another ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service technique. Monitoring for a sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent.
