Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are control messages and do not indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomalies flagged, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other non-DoS related problems.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods or unusual ICMP traffic volume.  
- If heuristics and taxonomy data become available, correlate with ICMP type 8 traffic for more precise detection.
