Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections originating from the single source IP 133.243.5.1 targeting various destination IPs with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). This pattern—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from one host to many targets in a short time frame—is characteristic of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade network performance.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 133.243.5.1  
- Multiple destination IPs: 185.198.99.90, 82.230.36.60, 189.190.105.109, 185.62.199.43, 37.23.67.238, 185.198.98.150  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from 133.243.5.1 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Block or throttle traffic from 133.243.5.1 to prevent further flooding.  
3. Monitor network traffic for additional signs of ICMP-based DoS attacks.  
4. Investigate the source host 133.243.5.1 for compromise or misuse.  
5. Notify affected destination IP owners if internal to your network or coordinate with upstream providers if external.  
6. Consider deploying anomaly-based detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
