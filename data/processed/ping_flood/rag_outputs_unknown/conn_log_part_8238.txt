Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the second entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods. Additionally, the volume and pattern of ICMP traffic in the snippet do not indicate a flood; there is only one Echo Request and one unrelated ICMP message.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, heuristic for ping flood would involve repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high frequency from a single source to a target, which is not observed here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review other logs or network metrics for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
