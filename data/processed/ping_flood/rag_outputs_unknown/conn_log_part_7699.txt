Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) and thus not indicative of a ping flood. The second ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8. Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic does not match other common attack types such as ICMP flood or smurf attacks, as there is no evidence of excessive Echo Requests or broadcast amplification.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request (type 8) traffic volume from any source IP. If a surge in type 8 packets is detected, investigate for potential ping flood activity. Additionally, review network baseline metrics to identify unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
