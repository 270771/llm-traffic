Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging in Zeek or other network monitoring tools to capture ICMP type and frequency.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP Echo Requests from single or multiple sources as a sign of ping flood.
