Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.79, but it appears as a single connection record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets means this traffic does not match the known ping flood heuristic, which requires repeated ICMP Echo Requests.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related anomalies in future logs.
