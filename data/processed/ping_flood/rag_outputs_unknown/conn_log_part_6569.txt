Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network misconfigurations or traceroute activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
