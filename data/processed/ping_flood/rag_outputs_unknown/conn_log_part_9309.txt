Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from different source IPs (133.227.176.6, 133.227.235.23, 133.227.199.11, 133.227.153.37) to the same destination IP (100.84.99.85) in a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / DoS Attack."
- Involved IPs: Sources - 133.227.176.6, 133.227.235.23, 133.227.199.11, 133.227.153.37; Destination - 100.84.99.85; Port is 0 as ICMP does not use ports.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation and ensure critical services on 100.84.99.85 are protected or isolated if needed.
