Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 36.174.60.103 to 163.45.208.92, but it shows only a single packet (`1` packet, 28 bytes) with no signs of flooding or high volume.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.  
- The absence of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or sustained high packet counts indicates no ping flood pattern.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be explicitly referenced. However, if this were a ping flood, heuristic #1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" would typically apply.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or misconfigurations, as these can indicate routing or firewall problems.
