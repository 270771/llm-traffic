Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3`, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This indicates the traffic is ICMP but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the observed traffic likely represents normal ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 5.131.34.9 to 202.101.170.61, which could indicate a developing ping flood. Also, investigate why ICMP type 3 messages are being generated to ensure no underlying network issues.
