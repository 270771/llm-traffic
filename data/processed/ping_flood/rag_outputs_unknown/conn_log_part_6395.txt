Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP traffic in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the entries have type 8, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable messages, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network misconfigurations or routing issues causing these ICMP error messages. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.
