Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request) from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.144, but only a single packet is logged with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition.  
- The second ICMP record has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8, so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that would characterize a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 packets if they are unusually frequent, as they may indicate network issues or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
