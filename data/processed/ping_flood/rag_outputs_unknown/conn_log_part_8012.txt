Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (107.102.62.64) from many different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources from the 157.206.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.206.232.229, 157.206.236.250, 157.206.2.77, etc.) targeting destination IP 107.102.62.64 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or router.
  2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (107.102.62.64) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  5. Consider implementing ICMP traffic filtering policies to allow only legitimate diagnostic traffic.
