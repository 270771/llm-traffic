Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the field with value 0 after the destination port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP type 0 packets (Echo Reply) to ensure they are legitimate responses and not part of a different anomaly such as ICMP reply floods or reflection attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly detection tools for further analysis.
