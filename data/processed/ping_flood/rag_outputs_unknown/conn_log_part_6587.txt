Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an unusual or incomplete connection, but without further data, this does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 and destination IP 96.23.111.17 for any other suspicious activity or logs showing ICMP type 8 traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or high ICMP traffic volume to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
