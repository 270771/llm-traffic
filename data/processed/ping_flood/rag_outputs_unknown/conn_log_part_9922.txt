Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there is only a single packet recorded, not a flood or high volume of ICMP Echo Requests. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source targeting the same destination, this does not match ping flood patterns.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may indicate network issues or scanning activity, which could be investigated further by reviewing additional logs for patterns of ICMP errors or other suspicious traffic.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential ping floods. Also, investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages to rule out misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts.
