Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show either TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The UDP traffic on port 5060 appears repeatedly from 45.121.95.154, but this is likely SIP signaling traffic, not ICMP.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the repeated UDP traffic on port 5060 from 45.121.95.154 for potential SIP-related abuse or scanning.
- Monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request floods or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or filtering to better detect ping floods if they occur.
