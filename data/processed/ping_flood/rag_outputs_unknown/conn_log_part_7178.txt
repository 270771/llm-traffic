Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has type 128 (indicated by the Zeek conn.log ICMP code field), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or other ICMP message, but not type 8 (ICMP Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume, no attack is indicated.

Next steps: Investigate if there are other ICMP Echo Request entries (type 8) with high frequency or volume from the same source IP (2001:b744:c5e1:6cfd:3ff:603e:c932:5625) or to the destination IP (2001:fcff:fb7d:4f18:60:63ee:330e:4746). Monitoring ICMP traffic patterns over time would help detect potential ping floods.
