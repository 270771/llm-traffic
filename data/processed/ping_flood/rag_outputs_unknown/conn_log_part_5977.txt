Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 0, and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 record (from 163.84.72.223 to 163.45.128.81) but no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests indicative of flooding.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The presence of ICMP type 3 and 0 traffic is normal network behavior related to error messages and replies.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at high frequency to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.84.72.223 if it starts sending multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
