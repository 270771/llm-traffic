Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 3.192.28.218, from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013211.76). This pattern—many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.192.28.218 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.210.155, 133.243.73.5, 133.243.220.55, 133.243.242.179, 133.243.251.255, 133.243.204.249, 133.243.242.248, 133.243.84.165, 133.243.187.111, 133.243.251.252, 133.243.85.5, 133.243.247.249, 133.243.24.7, 133.243.19.197, 133.243.240.14, 133.243.252.154, 133.243.154.142, among others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 3.192.28.218.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are confirmed malicious.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust defenses accordingly.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation appliances or cloud-based DDoS protection services to absorb and filter attack traffic.
