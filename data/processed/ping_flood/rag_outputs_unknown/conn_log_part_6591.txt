Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates error messages rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns or other common ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Investigate why ICMP type 3 messages are generatedâ€”this could indicate network misconfigurations or unreachable hosts, which may warrant further network diagnostics but is not an attack.
