Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the conn.log snippet is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no other attack type can be confidently identified from this single entry. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate additional logs for repeated ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from the same source IP (203.78.136.169) to the destination (85.84.138.68) to confirm or rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for other ICMP types that may indicate different network issues or attacks.
