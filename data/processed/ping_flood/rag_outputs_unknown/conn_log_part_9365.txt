Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from multiple source IPs within the 157.206.x.x subnet targeting two destination IPs: 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26. The rapid succession of these echo requests within a very narrow timestamp window (~1641013232.998 to 1641013233.002) is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where numerous ICMP echo requests are sent to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single or few targets."  
- Taxonomy class: "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service Attack."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.206.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 157.206.147.233, 157.206.117.57, 157.206.145.182, etc.)  
- Destination IPs: 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.206.0.0/16) targeting the victim IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.  
4. Notify affected parties (owners of 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate mitigation efforts.  
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent attacking IPs if mitigation at the perimeter is insufficient.
