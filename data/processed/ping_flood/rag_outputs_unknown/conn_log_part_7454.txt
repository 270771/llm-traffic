Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 10, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the basis for ping floods. Types 10 (Router Advertisement) and 11 (Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents direct referencing, but by standard ICMP behavior, these types do not match ping flood patterns.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), with no evidence of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests or abnormal traffic volume.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. However, ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) can sometimes be related to traceroute or network issues, which might warrant further network diagnostics if frequent.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.140.213 and 133.227.135.199) for unusual behavior if other alerts arise.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve future detection accuracy.
