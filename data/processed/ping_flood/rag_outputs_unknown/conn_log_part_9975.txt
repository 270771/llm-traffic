Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic entries would be identifiable by protocol number 1 (ICMP), but the provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to confirm a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic shown is mostly on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), and TCP traffic is on various ports, none related to ICMP.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
- Verify if UDP port 5060 traffic is legitimate SIP signaling or part of another attack vector such as SIP flooding or scanning.
