Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which do not indicate ping flood behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known attack patterns is possible.  

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the given data, no immediate security incident is indicated.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 11 and 3 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes that could indicate a ping flood.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP traffic analysis to improve detection capabilities.
