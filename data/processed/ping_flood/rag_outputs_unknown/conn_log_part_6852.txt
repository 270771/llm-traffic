Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating from a single source IP (54.236.220.60) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.044 seconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets to various hosts is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: High-rate ICMP echo request flood**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood** based on standard attack classifications.
- Involved IP addresses: Attacker/source IP is 54.236.220.60; multiple destination IPs include 163.45.94.102, 163.45.124.158, 163.45.10.204, 163.45.221.12, and 163.45.177.133. Ports are ICMP type 8 (echo request), no ports in traditional TCP/UDP sense.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.236.220.60 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS rules.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if internal hosts were impacted and strengthen network segmentation to limit attack surface.
