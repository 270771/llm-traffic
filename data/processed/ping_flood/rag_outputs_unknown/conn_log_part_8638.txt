Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port, here showing "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply or Destination Unreachable, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 1 traffic to ensure it is legitimate and not part of another reconnaissance or denial-of-service pattern. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs (133.227.159.37 and 147.134.251.93) to detect potential future ping floods.
