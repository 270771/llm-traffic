Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 163.84.73.84.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The packets originate from numerous distinct source IPs, indicating a distributed pattern.
- The timestamps are nearly identical, showing a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time frame.
- This matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests to degrade or deny service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 163.84.73.84 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.116.253, 157.206.144.252, 157.206.82.195, 133.243.78.5, 133.243.120.241, 157.206.81.35, and others.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target if not required for legitimate operations.
