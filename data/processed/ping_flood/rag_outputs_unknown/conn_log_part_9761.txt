Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given logs. The connections mostly show failed TCP handshakes (S0 state) and some UDP traffic, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, often classified under "Network Scanning" or "Reconnaissance" taxonomy.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed connection attempts (e.g., 89.247.x.x, 45.121.95.154) for potential scanning activity. Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ping flood attempts. Also, correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context.
