Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, the safest classification is that this is normal ICMP diagnostic traffic or possibly a traceroute-related message.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 11 messages that could indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
