Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. The first entry has ICMP type 8, but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or anomaly taxonomy, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate if the source IP 151.105.96.5 sends multiple echo requests in a short time frame.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics or IDS alerts for ICMP floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
No heuristics or taxonomy classes are assigned due to lack of anomaly data and context.
