Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or another network issue. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential future ping floods.
