Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 7th field after source port) is either missing or not equal to 8 in these records. Specifically, the entries with ICMP type values are 3 and 1, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "ICMP Echo Reply" respectively, not "Echo Request" (type 8) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Echo Reply) are normal ICMP message types used in network diagnostics and error reporting, not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 163.45.185.20 sending multiple ICMP Echo Replies and Destination Unreachable messages to different destinations to ensure these are legitimate responses and not part of another reconnaissance or misconfiguration issue.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- If further anomalies arise, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify suspicious patterns.
