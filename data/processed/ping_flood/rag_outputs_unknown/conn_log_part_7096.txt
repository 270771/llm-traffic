Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is 8 in the 4th column, which is 8 here, but the actual ICMP type is in the 7th column which is 0, indicating code or type?), but the key field for ICMP type is the 4th column which is 8, meaning Echo Request, so let's re-examine carefully:

Zeek conn.log fields (standard) are:

- ts (timestamp)
- uid
- id.orig_h (originating host IP)
- id.orig_p (originating port or ICMP type)
- id.resp_h (responding host IP)
- id.resp_p (responding port or ICMP code)
- proto
- service
- duration
- orig_bytes
- resp_bytes
- conn_state
- local_orig
- local_resp
- missed_bytes
- history
- orig_pkts
- orig_ip_bytes
- resp_pkts
- resp_ip_bytes
- tunnel_parents

From the snippet:

1641013212.103862	C95XeJ3RHwbpX2DA2f	217.174.50.196	8	203.78.128.250	0	icmp	-	1.673256	112	16	OTH	F	F	0	-	0	0	0	0	-	1

- id.orig_p = 8 (ICMP type 8 = Echo Request)
- id.resp_p = 0 (ICMP code 0)
- proto = icmp

This is an ICMP Echo Request from 217.174.50.196 to 203.78.128.250.

However, this is a single connection record with duration 1.67 seconds, 112 bytes sent, 16 bytes received, and state OTH (other).

No anomaly records are found.

No heuristic context is available.

Since only one ICMP Echo Request is logged, and no anomaly or multiple rapid requests are present, this does not indicate a ping flood.

No other suspicious patterns or anomalies are evident.

No ping flood is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated.

Without heuristics or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP at high frequency to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify patterns.
