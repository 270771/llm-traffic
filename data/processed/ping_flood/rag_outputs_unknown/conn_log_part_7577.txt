Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) involves two connections from source IP 151.105.96.5 to different destination IPs (133.105.230.253 and 133.105.230.254), each with a single packet and minimal payload (0 bytes). This does not match the pattern of a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.

The other ICMP entry with type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods, as only type 8 is relevant for such attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of volume and the presence of only single packets indicate normal or benign ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency or volume from these or other IPs. If multiple ICMP type 8 packets flood the network rapidly, re-evaluate for ping flood conditions.
