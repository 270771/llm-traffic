Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, there is no record of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest otherwise.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts to capture potential ping flood activity.  
- Monitor for other types of suspicious TCP connection attempts, as many entries show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no classification can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood heuristics.
