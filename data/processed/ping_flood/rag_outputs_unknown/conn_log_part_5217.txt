Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs (icmp.log or similar) are available to confirm the absence of ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review TCP SYN scan heuristics if scanning activity is suspected, as the current TCP connection attempts may warrant further analysis for reconnaissance behavior.
