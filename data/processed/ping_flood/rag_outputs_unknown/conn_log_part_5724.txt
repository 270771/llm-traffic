Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry from 202.250.217.7 to 64.190.198.220 has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry from 203.78.143.78 to 5.104.87.2 has ICMP type 0, which is an echo reply, also not an echo request. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP type 8 traffic or high-volume repetitive ICMP echo requests, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages (202.250.217.7) to understand if there are network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If other suspicious traffic patterns emerge, apply relevant heuristics once available.
