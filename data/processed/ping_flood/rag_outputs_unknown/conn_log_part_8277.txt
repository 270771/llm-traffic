Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. The source IP 52.196.212.42 is sending a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests to many different destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic #1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations**.  
- The taxonomy class is **Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Attacker/source IP: 52.196.212.42  
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x subnet (e.g., 163.45.71.181, 163.45.39.231, 163.45.97.19, etc.)  
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:  
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 52.196.212.42 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).  
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.  
3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to automatically detect and respond to similar patterns.  
4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.  
5. Notify upstream providers or the ISP responsible for 52.196.212.42 to take action if the source is external.  
6. Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood scenarios.
