Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 52.222.245.10.
- All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The source IPs are numerous and distinct (e.g., 133.227.150.249, 133.227.144.254, 133.227.167.254, etc.), indicating a high volume of echo requests from multiple sources in a short time frame.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 52.222.245.10 (no port for ICMP)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.227.150.249, 133.227.144.254, 133.227.167.254, 133.227.208.7, 133.227.167.249, 133.227.62.210, 133.227.208.8, 133.227.117.238, 133.227.144.248, 133.227.167.201.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.222.245.10.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from identified malicious source IPs.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
