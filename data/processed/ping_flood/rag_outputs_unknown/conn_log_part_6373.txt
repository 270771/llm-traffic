Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Specifically, the ICMP type values are 3 and 11, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectively. Since a ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages often indicate network troubleshooting or error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing frequent ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- If unusual volumes of ICMP error messages persist, consider deeper packet inspection to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or scanning activity.
