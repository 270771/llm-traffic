Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.105.128.252 and destination IP 92.81.101.105 for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-related issues, and monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
