Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code fields (3 and 3) for source and destination ports, which correspond to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.243.68.103 and destination IP 167.31.194.89 for potential ICMP error message floods or other ICMP-based reconnaissance, as ICMP type 3 can be used in network scanning or misconfiguration. Collect more detailed ICMP type and code data and monitor for volume spikes or repeated error messages.
