Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:
- Heuristic for ping flood would require ICMP type 8 with high frequency.
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps: Investigate the purpose of ICMP type 13 traffic if it is unusually frequent or from suspicious sources, as timestamp requests can be used for reconnaissance. Monitor for any escalation or changes in ICMP traffic patterns.
