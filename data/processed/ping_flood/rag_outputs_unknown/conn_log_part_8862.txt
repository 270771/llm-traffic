Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values other than 8 (Echo Request). For example, the last entry has ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), and others have type 0 or 11, none of which correspond to ICMP Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Given the lack of heuristic and taxonomy context, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned here.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 1 and 11 messages to determine if they indicate network issues or other reconnaissance activities. Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
