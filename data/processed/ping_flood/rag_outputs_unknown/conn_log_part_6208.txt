Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show protocol 11 (ICMP) with ICMP type field as 0, not 8. Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the lack of ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly flags, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, time exceeded) that might indicate network issues or other attack types. Collect additional logs with ICMP type details to clarify the traffic purpose.
