Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no established connections (S0) for possible TCP SYN scan or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.
