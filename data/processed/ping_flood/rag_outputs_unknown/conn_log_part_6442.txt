Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 202.250.202.133 and 96.89.36.206 to determine if it is part of a legitimate response or another anomaly. Monitoring for increased volume or other ICMP types may help detect other ICMP-based attacks.
