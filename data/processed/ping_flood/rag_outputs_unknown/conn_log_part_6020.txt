Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 13 and 0, which correspond to "Timestamp" and "Echo Reply" messages, respectively, not the ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP types related to timestamp and echo reply, it may be normal network diagnostic or time synchronization traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of these ICMP types that could indicate other reconnaissance or timing-based attacks. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
