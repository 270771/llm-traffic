Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Given the ICMP type, this traffic may be benign or related to network diagnostics rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic with high frequency from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any unusual volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests if they appear.
