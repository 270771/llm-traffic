Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP types are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) indicate other ICMP message types unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records are found and no heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or other benign ICMP activity rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of misconfigurations or other network problems.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
