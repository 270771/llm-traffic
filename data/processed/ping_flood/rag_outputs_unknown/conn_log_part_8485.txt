Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the volume and timing of these requests do not indicate a flood pattern. The entries are sparse and isolated rather than a rapid, high-volume burst typical of a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no anomalies are detected and no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific attack classification can be assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate network diagnostics or low-level scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs, which could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable rate-limiting or alerting on ICMP traffic if thresholds are exceeded.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP types or patterns if they appear in future logs.
