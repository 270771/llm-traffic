Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Among the ICMP entries, only one record shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is a legitimate ping request. However, there is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting a destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entries have type 3 or 11, which are not echo requests and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 11 (time exceeded) suggests normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or rate from any source IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood or denial-of-service activity.
