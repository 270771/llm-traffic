Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state further, as these may indicate port scanning or other reconnaissance. Monitoring for ICMP traffic should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
