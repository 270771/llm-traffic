Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, but none are ICMP traffic.
- ICMP traffic would be indicated by protocol number 1, but all entries show either UDP (17) or TCP (6).
- Additionally, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP traffic is mostly on port 5060 (SIP signaling), and TCP traffic is on various ports, none related to ICMP.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Since no ping flood or other clear attack is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets on port 5060 from IP 45.121.95.154, as repeated failed UDP connections could indicate scanning or SIP-related abuse.
- Enable ICMP-specific logging or packet capture to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to confirm or rule out ping floods in the future.
