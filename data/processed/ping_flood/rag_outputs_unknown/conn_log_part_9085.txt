Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping.
- Multiple distinct source IPs are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.223.127.239, 18.46.237.125, and 44.197.149.57) in a very short time window (all timestamps are nearly identical).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a few destinations simultaneously is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target hosts with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood detection: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single or few destinations.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.
- Heuristic number: Assign heuristic #1 (ICMP Flood Detection) as the most likely given the traffic pattern.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.101.239, 133.227.195.255, 157.206.249.203, 133.243.232.149, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 52.223.127.239, 18.46.237.125, and 44.197.149.57.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the field is 0 or "-".

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs.
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor affected hosts for service degradation and prepare to apply temporary ICMP blocking if service impact is severe.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts if the attack is distributed from internal IPs.
6. Inform network operations and incident response teams to maintain heightened alertness for follow-up attacks.
