Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, the log shows only two isolated ICMP echo requests from 151.105.96.5 to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.80 and 133.105.230.90) with no indication of high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood attack. There is no evidence of sustained or volumetric ICMP traffic that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic is normal ICMP echo requests without flooding characteristics, no attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP. If a sudden surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network baseline traffic patterns to identify deviations.
