Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP code field is 1), which corresponds to an ICMP destination unreachable message, not an echo request (type 8). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ICMP type 1 traffic is typically diagnostic or error-related, not indicative of flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 157.206.194.66 and destination IP 185.145.15.199 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect possible future ping floods.
