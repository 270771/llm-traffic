Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic appears to be a normal ICMP echo reply.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request (type 8) traffic volume from or to these IPs (174.58.192.131 and 203.78.135.92). If a surge in type 8 packets occurs, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
