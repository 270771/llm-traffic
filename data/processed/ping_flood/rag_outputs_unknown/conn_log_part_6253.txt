Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 11th column) is 0 or 10 or 11, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. The observed ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 10 = Router Advertisement, 11 = Time Exceeded) suggest normal or other diagnostic ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP types 0, 10, or 11 to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate a potential ping flood.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or reconnaissance once available.
