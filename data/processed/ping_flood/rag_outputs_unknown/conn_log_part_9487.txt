Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 133.227.58.122 to 45.219.3.240 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows traffic from 3.241.1.60 to 202.250.202.160 with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8.  
- No ICMP Echo Request (type 8) packets are present in the snippet, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are found in the provided anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs containing ICMP type 8 packets with high frequency from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns that could suggest other ICMP-based attacks such as Smurf or ICMP flood variants.
