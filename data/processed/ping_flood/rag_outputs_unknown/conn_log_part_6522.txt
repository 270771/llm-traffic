Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies are recorded, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate why multiple ICMP type 3 messages are observed between these IPs, as it may indicate network misconfiguration or connectivity issues rather than an attack. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or unusual volume would be prudent.
