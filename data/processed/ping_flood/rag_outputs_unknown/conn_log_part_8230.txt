Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such event with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a denial-of-service (DoS) attack taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP echo request flooding.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential DoS activity. Also, consider enabling rate limiting on ICMP traffic at network perimeter devices to mitigate future risks.
