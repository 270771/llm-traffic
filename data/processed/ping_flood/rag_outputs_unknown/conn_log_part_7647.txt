Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is OTH (other), and the flags indicate no unusual behavior.

Next steps: Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from the source IP 163.45.190.179 to 183.204.158.107. If a high rate of Echo Requests appears, investigate for potential ping flood activity.
