Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show type 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request" messages, not type 8 (echo request) required for ping floods. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the traffic involves ICMP type 13, it may be normal network diagnostic activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is an unusual volume or pattern of ICMP timestamp requests that could indicate reconnaissance or other probing activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.
