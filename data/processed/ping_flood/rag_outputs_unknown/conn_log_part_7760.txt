Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), but the traffic volume and pattern in the snippet do not indicate a flood. The first record shows a single ICMP echo request with a duration of about 2 seconds and 72 bytes transferred, which is normal. The second record lacks byte and packet counts, suggesting no sustained traffic. There is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from one source to one or multiple destinations that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood or other attack pattern is evident, no immediate security response is required.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs. If a pattern of repeated, high-rate ICMP echo requests emerges, investigate for potential ping flood attacks.
