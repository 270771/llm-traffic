Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first entry (ICMP type 3) indicates a "Destination Unreachable" message, and the second entry (ICMP type 0) is an "Echo Reply." These are normal ICMP control messages and do not indicate flooding.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available, but based on standard ICMP type definitions, these packets do not represent a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.105.128.252 sending ICMP type 3 messages if frequent, as it may indicate network issues or misconfigurations. Similarly, monitor ICMP Echo Replies for unusual volume, but no immediate attack is evident.
