Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP connections have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 4th field after source IP and port), which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. The traffic shows isolated ICMP packets with OTH (other) state, indicating no established or continuous echo request flows typical of ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any other ICMP types 8 flows or high-rate ICMP traffic elsewhere in the logs. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or spikes in ICMP traffic volume that could indicate early-stage reconnaissance or flooding attempts.
