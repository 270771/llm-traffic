Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections, but the ICMP type field is mostly 0, 8, or other values. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to echo request (ping). However, the volume and pattern of these ICMP type 8 packets do not indicate a flood. The timestamps are close but do not show a high rate of repeated echo requests from a single source to a single destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic for ping flood would involve detecting high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP traffic further by analyzing packet rates per source IP and destination IP over a longer time window to confirm no flooding behavior. Also, verify if any other ICMP types or unusual flags are present that might indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks.
