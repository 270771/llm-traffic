Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries have types other than 8 (echo request). Specifically, the ICMP types are 1, 3, and 0, which correspond to destination unreachable, destination unreachable (or other error), and echo reply respectively. Since a ping flood requires a high volume of ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed ICMP types suggest normal error or reply traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for potential network issues causing ICMP error messages (types 1 and 3).  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- If unusual volumes of ICMP error messages persist, consider deeper packet inspection or network device logs to rule out other network problems or reconnaissance activity.
