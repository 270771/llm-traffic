Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are from IPs 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.182 and 203.78.143.78 to 103.13.242.250, but the volume and frequency in this snippet are very low (single packets each).  
- The other ICMP entry has type 5 (Redirect), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No sustained or high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are visible, which is required to identify a ping flood.  

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 5 (Redirect) packet for potential network misconfiguration or other issues, as ICMP Redirects can sometimes indicate routing anomalies or attacks.
