Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are observed here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but given the absence of ICMP traffic, no ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are being captured elsewhere or if logging is incomplete.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests (type 8) to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review other logs for possible TCP-based attacks, as many connections show SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.
