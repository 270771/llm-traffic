Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is insufficient to classify as an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.227.58.120 and destination IP 115.222.15.43 for potential network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP Time Exceeded messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect possible future ping floods.
