Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. This traffic indicates an ICMP error message rather than a flood of ping requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic is consistent with normal ICMP error reporting rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages from 157.206.108.222 to 8.102.27.46 could be useful to detect potential network issues or misconfigurations.
