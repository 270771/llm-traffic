Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic between two IPv6 addresses with ICMP type not specified as 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests to be sent in high volume.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the OTH state in ICMP traffic to ensure it is not related to other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Specifically, capture ICMP type and code fields in future logs to better classify traffic. Monitoring for high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) remains critical for detecting ping floods.
