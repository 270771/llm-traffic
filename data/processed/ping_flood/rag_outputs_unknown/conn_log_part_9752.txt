Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second record shows ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomalies or heuristics are provided, and no suspicious volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) are present.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly records exist, no known ping flood heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there is a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in a broader log timeframe.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic volume or repeated failed connection attempts that might indicate other network issues or attacks.
