Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code and type columns, which here show "-" (missing or not type 8). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing more detailed ICMP type and code information, and monitor for any increase in packet rate or volume that might indicate other ICMP-based attacks.
