Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack, this traffic should not be considered malicious ping flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source of these ICMP Time Exceeded messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or routing loops. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
