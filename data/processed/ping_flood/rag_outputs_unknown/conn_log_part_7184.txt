Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 0, 1, 3, and 13. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) indicates other types of ICMP traffic but not ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs generating ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are not part of other reconnaissance or denial-of-service activities.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood attempts.
