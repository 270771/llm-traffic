Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as a ping flood, and no such data is shown.
- The logs show multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The connection attempts could be indicative of reconnaissance or scanning activity, which typically falls under heuristic classes related to network scanning or probing.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify if these TCP attempts are part of a larger attack pattern.
