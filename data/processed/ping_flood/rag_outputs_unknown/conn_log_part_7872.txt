Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (Echo Reply), not 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents ICMP Echo Replies rather than the flood of Echo Requests typical of a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly indicated in the provided data. Without heuristic context or anomaly records, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a corresponding high volume of ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) from the same or related IPs to confirm or rule out a ping flood. Also, monitor for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that may indicate different network issues or attacks.
