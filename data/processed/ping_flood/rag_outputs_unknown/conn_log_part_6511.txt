Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 1, 6, or other than 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and none of the records show type 8, there is no evidence of a ping flood attack. The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests characteristic of ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic rules out ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP types present (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 6 = Parameter Problem) to determine if other ICMP-based anomalies or misconfigurations exist. Monitoring for unusual volumes or patterns in these ICMP types may be warranted.
