Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic between IPs, but the ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly indicated as type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not confirmed as 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The connection states are "OTH" (other), and flags indicate no established or typical ping flood behavior.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type details in more granular logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of the ICMP traffic. Also, monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic volume from these IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
