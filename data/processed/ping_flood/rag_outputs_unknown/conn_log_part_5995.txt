Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP types 11, 11, and 8 respectively. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. However, the single ICMP type 8 record shows only one packet (count=0 or 1), which is insufficient to indicate flooding. The other two entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ICMP Flood," but these cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential DoS activity.
