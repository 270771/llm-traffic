Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 13 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Type 13 is Timestamp Request and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 13 packets for potential misconfigurations or other network issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
