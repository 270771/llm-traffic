Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate a ping flood, which is not the case here.
- The traffic mostly consists of failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state) and some UDP traffic on port 5060 (commonly SIP), none of which match ping flood patterns.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply.
- The observed traffic could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity due to many failed connection attempts, which should be investigated further.

Next steps:
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).
- Investigate the repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to identify any suspicious patterns on UDP port 5060 or TCP ports like 8080.
