Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages (ping).
- Multiple ICMP Echo Requests are sent from single source IPs (e.g., 173.20.80.38) to different destination IPs (163.45.128.89 and 163.45.128.90) in rapid succession (timestamps within milliseconds).
- This pattern of high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, assign the most likely heuristic as:
  - Heuristic #1: High-rate ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Source IPs: 173.20.80.38, 18.76.68.232
- Destination IPs: 163.45.128.89, 163.45.128.90, 163.45.255.239
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (173.20.80.38, 18.76.68.232) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle malicious ICMP traffic if attack volume is large.
- Investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse to prevent further attacks.
