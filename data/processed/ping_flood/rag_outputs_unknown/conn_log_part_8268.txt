Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the source IP, which shows the value `8` for both entries. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the correct type for ping packets. However, the volume and pattern of these entries do not indicate a flood. The logs show only two distinct ICMP Echo Requests from different source IPs to different destinations, with no evidence of rapid, repeated requests from a single source targeting one destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no known suspicious patterns or classifications are matched.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination within a short time frame, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate if any other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns emerge that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks or reconnaissance.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes significantly, consider enabling rate limiting or filtering on network devices to mitigate potential ping floods.
