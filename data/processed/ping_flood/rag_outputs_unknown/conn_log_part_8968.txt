Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) packets all targeting a single destination IP address (3.197.247.113) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013230.38). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Heuristics and Taxonomy: Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this traffic matches the classic heuristic for ICMP flood attacksâ€”excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host. The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Victim IP: 3.197.247.113 (destination)
- Attacker IPs: Multiple sources in the 157.206.x.x range
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.197.247.113.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the victim host if operationally feasible to reduce impact.
