Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a high volume of ICMP traffic originating from a single source IP (18.73.129.47) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds).
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages, the exact type used in ping floods.
- The rapid succession and distribution of ICMP Echo Requests to many different IPs is consistent with a classic ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High-rate ICMP Echo Request flood from a single source."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 18.73.129.47
- Multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x range
- ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), no ports involved (ICMP is portless).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.73.129.47 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other DoS attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider about the abusive IP to coordinate mitigation.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events.
5. If internal hosts are affected, isolate impacted systems and perform forensic analysis to ensure no compromise beyond DoS.
