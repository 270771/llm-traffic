Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 3 (Destination Unreachable), not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. ICMP type 3 typically indicates network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 133.251.128.196 and destination IP 162.113.225.178 for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages or other suspicious traffic patterns.
