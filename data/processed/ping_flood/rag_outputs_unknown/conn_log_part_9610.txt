Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show ICMP type 11 (code 11 is Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 11 packets often indicate traceroute or network path issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (128.12.64.149 and 203.78.136.88) for unusual ICMP Time Exceeded traffic volume or patterns that might indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could signal the start of a ping flood.
