Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping flood detection. The first entry has ICMP type 8 (from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.119.227), but it is a single connection record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior. The second entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a large volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to one or multiple destinations in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 172.23.68.231 is generating excessive ICMP traffic over time.  
- Correlate with network flow data or IDS alerts for volumetric ICMP anomalies.
