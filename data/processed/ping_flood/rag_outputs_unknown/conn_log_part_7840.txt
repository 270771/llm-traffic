Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.15, which is a valid ping request.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) from 203.78.136.169 to 23.12.184.89, which is not a ping request and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no attack is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from any single IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 messages if they persist, as they may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
