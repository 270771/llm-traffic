Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114) within a very narrow timestamp window (all around 1641013220.3). The volume of distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets simultaneously to the same destination IPs strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple from the 157.206.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.206.172.135, 157.206.116.110, 157.206.150.211, etc.)  
- Destination IPs: Primarily 3.196.199.185 and 174.95.41.114  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.206.0.0/16) targeting the victim IPs.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering or blackholing.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns and adjust mitigation accordingly.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume escalates.
