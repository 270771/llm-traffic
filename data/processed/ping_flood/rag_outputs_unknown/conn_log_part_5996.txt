Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in the first three entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, these are isolated single packets to different destination IPs, not a high volume or rapid succession from one source to one target that would indicate flooding. The fourth entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would require sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one source to one destination.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated, high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination. Investigate if any source IP sends a large burst of Echo Requests within a short time frame, which would be indicative of a ping flood.
