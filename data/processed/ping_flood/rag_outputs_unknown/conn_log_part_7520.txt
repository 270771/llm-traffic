Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first ICMP record shows no ICMP type specified (field is "-"), so it cannot be a ping request (type 8). The second record shows ICMP type 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Therefore, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of type 8 ICMP packets and no anomaly flags, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 sending ICMP Echo Replies (type 0) to 125.209.123.6 to ensure this is expected behavior and not part of a larger suspicious pattern. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or unusual traffic volume that could indicate emerging threats.
