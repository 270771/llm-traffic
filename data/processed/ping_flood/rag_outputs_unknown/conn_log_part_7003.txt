Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, the connection duration is only 1.75 seconds with a single packet (orig_pkts=1), indicating no rapid or repeated ICMP echo requests typical of a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is evident from this single ICMP echo request. Without multiple packets or sustained traffic, this is normal ping activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP echo requests from 35.83.191.13 to 163.45.255.18 over a short time frame to detect potential flooding.
