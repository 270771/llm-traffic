Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 157.206.157.225 to destination 3.39.157.141, but it shows a single connection record with zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no flood or high volume of echo requests. The other ICMP entries have type 13 (Timestamp Request), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Typically, heuristic #1 would relate to ICMP Echo Request floods, and taxonomy class would be "DoS/ICMP Flood," but these do not apply here due to lack of volume and type mismatch.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs. Investigate the source 157.206.157.225 if multiple echo requests appear in a short time frame, as it could indicate early-stage reconnaissance or a low-rate ping attempt.
