Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6) with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and no ICMP traffic is logged here, this cannot be a ping flood. The absence of ICMP type 8 packets rules out ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding or DoS via ICMP.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, TCP SYN scans or failed connection attempts would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, to ensure no ICMP-based attacks are missed.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Analyze TCP connection attempts for possible scanning or brute force activity.
