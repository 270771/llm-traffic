Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.39.157.141) from many different source IPs within the same second (timestamp 1641013233.15xxxx).
- This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target" and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Victim IP: 3.39.157.141 (destination)
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 157.206.147.69, 157.206.108.145, 157.206.149.10, 157.206.237.141, 157.206.237.23, 157.206.249.223, 157.206.123.154, 157.206.249.220, 157.206.123.114, 157.206.201.231, 157.206.206.197, 157.206.12.193, 157.206.14.54, 157.206.0.173, 157.206.170.255, 157.206.14.168, 157.206.125.173, 157.206.154.104, 157.206.2.176, 157.206.34.197, 157.206.34.202, 157.206.1.253, 157.206.12.66
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.39.157.141.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from identified attacker IPs if possible.
- Monitor the victim host for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation to broader DDoS mitigation services.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the victim host is vulnerable or misconfigured to respond to ICMP floods and harden accordingly.
