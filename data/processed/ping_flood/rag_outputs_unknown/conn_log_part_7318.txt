Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log entry is 0, which corresponds to an Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Reply packets in a short time frame or if other ICMP types (especially type 8) appear in the logs to rule out other ICMP-based attacks. Also, monitor for unusual traffic volume or patterns from the involved IPs (45.225.96.135 and 133.105.74.185).
