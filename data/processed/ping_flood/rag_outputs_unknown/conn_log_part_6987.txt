Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an Echo Request (ping). However, there is only a single packet recorded (orig_pkts=1), not a flood of packets. The second entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods. There is no evidence of high-volume or repetitive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as ICMP floods or scanning.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs. If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ping flood or DoS activity. Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Request floods.
