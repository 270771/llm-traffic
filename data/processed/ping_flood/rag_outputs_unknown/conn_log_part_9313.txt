Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 100.84.99.85 from various source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.227.96.148, 133.227.156.210, 133.227.135.133, etc.) targeting destination 100.84.99.85 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  3. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation on 100.84.99.85.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or unexpected regions.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to improve detection heuristics and update firewall rules accordingly.
