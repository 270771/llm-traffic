Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log format here does not indicate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. The connection state is OTH (other), and the packet count is very low (1), which does not match the high volume characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to indicate otherwise.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type field explicitly in future logs to confirm packet types. Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from 5.131.34.101 to 202.101.173.119 to detect potential ping floods.
