Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code fields (3 and 3) for source and destination ports, which correspond to ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records are found to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic context or anomaly taxonomy, the observed traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messaging rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 3 messages indicating network issues or misconfigurations, but no immediate security threat from ping flooding is detected.
