Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8 or not present at all, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the logs, which mostly show TCP connection attempts with SYN sent but no established sessions (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scan or connection flood heuristics would apply here if further investigation is warranted.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts (S0 states) for potential scanning or SYN flood activity.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify if these TCP attempts represent a different DoS or reconnaissance attack.  
- Enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts explicitly.
