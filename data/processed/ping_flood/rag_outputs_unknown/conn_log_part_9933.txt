Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the volume and frequency shown in the snippet are minimalâ€”only two ICMP Echo Requests within a very short time frame, each with a single packet (`id.orig_p=8` and `id.resp_p=8` are ICMP type and code, not ports). There is no evidence of high packet rate or sustained traffic from one source to multiple destinations or vice versa, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to indicate a known attack pattern here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request rates from the source IP 13.132.168.223.  
- Investigate if these pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.  
- If a sudden surge in ICMP traffic is detected, apply rate limiting or filtering rules accordingly.
