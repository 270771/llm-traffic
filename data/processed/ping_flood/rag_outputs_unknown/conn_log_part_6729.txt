Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8 and 128. ICMP type 8 corresponds to an Echo Request (ping), but the second record shows type 128, which is an ICMPv6 Echo Request. However, the first record shows only a single ICMP Echo Request packet (count=1), and the second record shows 58 packets but for ICMPv6. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination that would indicate a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets or a large volume of ICMP Echo Requests, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMPv6 traffic (type 128) further to ensure it is legitimate, as ICMPv6 can be used in other network functions or attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request rates or anomalies in ICMP traffic volume.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once available.
