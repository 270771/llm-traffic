Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type field values of 0 and 1 (last numeric fields before the final dash), which correspond to ICMP types other than 8 (Echo Request). Since a ping flood attack specifically requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is available to assign a specific classification.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further to determine if it relates to other ICMP-based activities such as Echo Reply (type 0) or Destination Unreachable (type 3) if present in other logs.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request packets (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.  
- Enable logging or alerting on high-rate ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts promptly.
