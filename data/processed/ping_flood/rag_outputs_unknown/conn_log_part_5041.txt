Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no other attack type is clearly indicated. The logs show mostly TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts to catch Echo Request floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that might indicate a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, which would require different heuristics and taxonomy.
