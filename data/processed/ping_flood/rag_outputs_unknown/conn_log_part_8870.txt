Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated as "0" (the 7th field after source IP and port), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks rely on a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic between 203.78.136.65 and 66.104.113.91 to determine if it is part of a different ICMP-based activity or misconfiguration. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
