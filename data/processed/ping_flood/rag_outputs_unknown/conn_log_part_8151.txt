Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 1, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The first record shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second shows ICMP type 1 (Echo Reply). These types indicate diagnostic or response traffic rather than an attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, the presence of ICMP Time Exceeded and Echo Reply packets is normal in network operations.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
