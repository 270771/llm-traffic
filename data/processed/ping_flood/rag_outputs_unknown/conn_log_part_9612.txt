Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP types 13, 10, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

The traffic instead shows other ICMP types:  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  
- Type 10: Router Advertisement  
- Type 0: Echo Reply  

These types do not indicate a ping flood but could be part of normal network operations or other ICMP-based activities.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- No explicit heuristics or taxonomy classes are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.  
- Given the absence of type 8 ICMP packets, no heuristic related to ping flood (commonly heuristic #1 or similar) applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual ICMP activity patterns if needed, especially if these ICMP types are unexpected in the environment.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would be indicative of a ping flood attack.  
- Consider enabling more detailed ICMP logging or anomaly detection rules to catch future ping flood attempts.
