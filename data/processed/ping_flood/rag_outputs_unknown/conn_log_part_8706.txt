Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP traffic from 203.78.143.78 to 186.13.16.5 with ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single such entry with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 3, which is a destination unreachable message, not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 8 alone does not confirm a ping flood without volume or frequency indicators, no attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets at high frequency from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping flood attempts. Also, investigate the ICMP type 3 message for possible network issues or misconfigurations.
