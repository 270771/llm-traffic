Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest other suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm no ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IP.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for ICMP-related alerts.
- Continue monitoring TCP/UDP connection attempts for other attack types such as SYN floods or port scans.
