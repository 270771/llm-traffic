Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The connection state is `OTH` (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP `133.227.58.122` and destination IP `185.247.18.210` for potential network scanning or other ICMP-based reconnaissance, as ICMP type 11 can be used in traceroute or network mapping activities. Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 11 messages that could indicate a different form of ICMP abuse.
