Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is the 4th column after the source IP in the Zeek log snippet. For example, in the first entry, the ICMP type is `3`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request). The second and third entries have ICMP type `8`, which is Echo Request, but these are isolated single connections without volume or frequency indicators of flooding.  
- There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 3 corresponds to a Destination Unreachable message, not a ping request.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. By default, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) heuristic and taxonomy, but this is not applicable here due to lack of evidence.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 8 packets (151.105.96.5 and 172.23.68.231) for any unusual patterns or volume over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs to detect potential emerging ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or network monitoring tools to confirm normal or suspicious behavior.
