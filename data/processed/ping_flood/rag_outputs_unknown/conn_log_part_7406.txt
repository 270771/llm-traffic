Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 203.78.143.78 to 154.49.113.1, but it appears as a single connection with a low packet count (32 packets over 0.26 seconds), which does not indicate flooding. The other ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not ping requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. Since no type 8 ICMP flood pattern is present, no ping flood is detected.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.143.78 for unusual ICMP Echo Request frequency over a longer time window to rule out slow-rate or low-volume ping scans. Also, monitor ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or other attack vectors such as reconnaissance or misconfigurations.
