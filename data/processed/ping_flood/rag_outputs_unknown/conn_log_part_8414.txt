Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are either 0, 1, 3, 11, 128, or 129. None of these are type 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood attack. The presence of other ICMP types (such as 3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded, 0 = Echo Reply, 1 = Destination Unreachable) indicates normal or other diagnostic ICMP traffic, not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned. However, since no type 8 ICMP packets are present, the traffic does not match the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network issues or reconnaissance activity.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential future ping flood attempts.  
- If other anomalies arise, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data for further analysis.
