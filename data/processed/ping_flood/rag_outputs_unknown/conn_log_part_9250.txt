Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP traffic would be identified by protocol number 1 in Zeek logs, but the provided snippet shows only UDP (17) and TCP (6) traffic.
- No entries indicate ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to confirm a ping flood.
- The traffic from 45.121.95.154 is UDP on port 5060 (commonly SIP signaling), showing multiple connection attempts but no ICMP packets.
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is present.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the observed traffic pattern (many UDP attempts to port 5060) could suggest a SIP scanning or UDP flood attempt, which would fall under heuristic class for volumetric UDP floods or reconnaissance, not ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP traffic from 45.121.95.154 to multiple destination IPs on port 5060 for potential SIP scanning or UDP flood.
- Enable ICMP monitoring to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for UDP flood or SIP attack signatures.
