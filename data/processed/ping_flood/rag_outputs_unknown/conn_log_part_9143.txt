Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 11, 3, and 8 respectively. According to the rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) indicates potential ping flood activity. Here, only one connection has type 8, but it shows a single packet count (1) and no signs of flooding such as high packet volume or repeated requests. The other two entries are ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 typically relate to network errors or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (58.142.235.228) to the destination (133.105.82.26).  
- Investigate if the single ICMP Echo Request is part of a larger pattern by correlating with additional logs or network traffic captures.  
- If volume spikes, apply heuristic for ICMP flood (commonly heuristic #1: ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service."

No current attack is present based on the provided data.
