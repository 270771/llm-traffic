Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request), but it is a single packet with no evidence of flooding or high volume.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic context, the default understanding is that ping floods require multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a target, which is not observed here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The first entry (type 3) could be normal network error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages are unusually frequent, which might indicate network issues or scanning activity.
