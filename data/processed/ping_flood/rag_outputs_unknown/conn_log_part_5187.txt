Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field = tcp). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts, but this is not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, SYN scan or connection attempt anomalies would fall under heuristics related to reconnaissance or scanning, but this cannot be confirmed here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP traffic logs are available separately to check for possible ping floods.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Analyze connection attempts for potential scanning activity, which may warrant further investigation.
