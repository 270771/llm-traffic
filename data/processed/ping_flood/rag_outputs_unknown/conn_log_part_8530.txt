Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP code field shows "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP destination unreachable message, not an echo request (type 8) used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.250.250.10 and destination IP 196.213.212.199 for potential network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies, focusing on the nature of ICMP type 1 messages. Further packet capture and analysis of ICMP traffic types and volumes would clarify if any other ICMP-based attacks or misconfigurations are present.
