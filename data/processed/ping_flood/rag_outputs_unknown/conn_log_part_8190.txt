Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the frequency and volume of ICMP type 13 messages to rule out potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based anomalies, but no immediate attack response is warranted based on this data.
