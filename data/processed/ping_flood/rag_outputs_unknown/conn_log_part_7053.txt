Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0, which for ICMP typically represents the ICMP code/type; here it is not 8). Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP type and code, and monitor for any increase in volume or frequency that might indicate other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
