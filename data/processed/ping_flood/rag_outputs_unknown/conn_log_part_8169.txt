Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 ("echo request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP echo requests.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since the ICMP type is 13, this could be legitimate timestamp synchronization traffic or a reconnaissance attempt, but it is not a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request (type 8) traffic volume from 157.206.49.81 to 8.102.27.46. Investigate if timestamp requests are unusually frequent or correlated with other suspicious activity.
