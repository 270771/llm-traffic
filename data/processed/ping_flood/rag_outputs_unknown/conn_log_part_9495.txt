Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with a destination port of 8, which corresponds to ICMP Echo Request (ping). However, the source port is 0, and the connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection state. The second entry shows ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not relevant for ping flood detection. There is no evidence of a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests or a clear pattern of flooding, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from any single IP.  
- Investigate the OTH connection state for potential misconfigurations or other ICMP-related anomalies.  
- If suspicious ICMP traffic volume increases, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: ICMP flood, taxonomy class: DoS/Probe).
