Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from various source IPs (157.206.77.70, 157.206.207.45, 157.206.247.189, 157.206.247.151, 157.206.248.170) targeting the same destination IP (44.198.161.223). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single host" typically classified under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Sources - 157.206.77.70, 157.206.207.45, 157.206.247.189, 157.206.247.151, 157.206.248.170; Destination - 44.198.161.223; Protocol - ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 44.198.161.223. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP traffic. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources. Notify the network operations team to monitor for collateral impact and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
