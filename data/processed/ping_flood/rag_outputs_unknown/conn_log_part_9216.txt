Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connection attempts, primarily from IP 45.121.95.154 targeting port 5060 (SIP) and other ports, but no ICMP traffic is present.
- There is no indication of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.
- The traffic appears to be connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state) or dropped UDP packets (S0 with D flag), but these do not match ping flood patterns.
- Without ICMP Echo Requests, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confirmed from this data.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the high volume of UDP packets from 45.121.95.154 to port 5060, as this may indicate a SIP scanning or UDP flood attempt.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Apply heuristics related to UDP flood or SIP scanning once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
