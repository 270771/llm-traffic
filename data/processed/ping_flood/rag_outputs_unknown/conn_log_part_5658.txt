Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which are normal control messages or could indicate other network issues but not a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, ICMP type 11 and 3 traffic is not classified under ping flood heuristics but may be relevant for network troubleshooting or other anomaly detection.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network issues such as routing problems or misconfigurations. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
