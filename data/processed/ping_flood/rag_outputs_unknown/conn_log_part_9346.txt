Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed as 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The conn.log entry shows ICMP protocol but lacks details indicating an Echo Request flood pattern. Additionally, the connection state is OTH (other), and no anomalies or heuristic matches are present in the anomaly CSV.

Without heuristic context or anomaly records, no known attack taxonomy applies here. The traffic does not match typical ping flood characteristics such as high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a target.

Next steps: Investigate the ICMP type and code fields in more detailed logs or packet captures to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume that could indicate other ICMP-based attacks.
