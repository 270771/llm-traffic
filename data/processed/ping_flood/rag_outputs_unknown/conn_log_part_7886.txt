Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 7th column after source IP and port) is not explicitly listed as type 8 (Echo Request). The first entry shows ICMP code 1, which is not type 8, and the second entry lacks detailed ICMP type information. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the observed traffic could be normal ICMP error or informational messages (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 1 = Host Unreachable), which are not indicative of flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP codes further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
