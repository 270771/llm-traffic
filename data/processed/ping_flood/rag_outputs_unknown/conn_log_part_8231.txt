Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 13, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the basis for ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (202.250.230.254 and 157.206.49.81) for unusual ICMP activity patterns or other anomalies.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.
