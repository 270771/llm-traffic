Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- The absence of ICMP type 8 packets means no ping flood pattern is detected.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for unusual volumes of ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.
