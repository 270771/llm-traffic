Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single echo request recorded from 1.71.157.8 to 203.78.223.42, not a flood of repeated requests.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to indicate suspicious volume or pattern consistent with a ping flood.  
- The connection states (OTH) and flags do not indicate abnormal repeated traffic or flooding behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by these entries. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics and anomaly detection tools to identify unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
