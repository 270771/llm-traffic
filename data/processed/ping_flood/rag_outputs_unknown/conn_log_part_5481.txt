Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Since no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is observed, the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known attack heuristics or taxonomy can be made.
- The observed traffic pattern may warrant investigation for TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance, as indicated by multiple SYN attempts without completion.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 89.247.69.x range) for potential scanning activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN scanning once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
