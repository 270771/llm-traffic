Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 0 (indicated by the source port field "0" for ICMP type), which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. A ping flood involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) overwhelming the target. Here, the traffic shows a single ICMP Echo Reply, which does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The connection state "OTH" indicates an unusual or incomplete connection but does not confirm an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in other logs or over time from the same source IP (203.78.143.78) to the destination (182.40.161.5). Monitor for high ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods.
