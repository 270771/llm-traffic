Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.203.247.100 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern—high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target—is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target with ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1 for ICMP flood detection: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination." The taxonomy class is "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.203.247.100 (receiving the flood)  
- Multiple source IPs including 133.243.204.132, 133.243.84.167, 133.243.84.162, 133.243.100.233, and others all sending ICMP type 8 packets.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.203.247.100.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.  
4. Monitor network and host performance metrics on 3.203.247.100 for signs of resource exhaustion.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if business operations allow.  
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify compromised hosts among the source IPs and remediate accordingly.
