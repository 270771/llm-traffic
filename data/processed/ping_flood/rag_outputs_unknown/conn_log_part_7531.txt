Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default understanding is that only ICMP type 8 traffic can be considered for ping flood detection.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other types of ICMP-based diagnostics or errors.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
