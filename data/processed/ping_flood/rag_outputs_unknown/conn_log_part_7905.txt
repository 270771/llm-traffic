Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 13 (timestamp request), which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request) from 133.243.6.38 to 185.140.66.70, but it is a single connection record with a duration of 1.4 seconds and only 168 bytes transferred, which does not indicate a flood or high-volume traffic typical of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to the destination IP to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate if the ICMP type 13 traffic is part of legitimate network diagnostics or unusual activity.
