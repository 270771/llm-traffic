Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 3, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is a single ICMP type 8 record: from 172.23.68.231 to 163.45.51.151, with zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no flood-level volume or repeated requests.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping floods.  

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, but based on standard taxonomy:  
- ICMP type 8 with low volume and no repetition does not meet criteria for ping flood (which requires high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).  
- Type 3 ICMP messages typically indicate network errors, not attacks.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source 172.23.68.231 for any unusual ICMP activity over a longer time window to rule out slow or low-rate scanning.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests with high packet counts to detect potential future ping floods.
