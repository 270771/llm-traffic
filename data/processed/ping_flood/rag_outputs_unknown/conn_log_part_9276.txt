Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP traffic, especially with type 8 (Echo Request), is required to identify a ping flood attack.
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets (S0 state) with no successful handshakes, indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other specific attacks.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics or taxonomy, the observed traffic aligns with reconnaissance or scanning behavior rather than flooding.
- Typical heuristic for scanning would be repeated SYN attempts without completion.
- Taxonomy class would be "Reconnaissance" or "Scanning" rather than "Denial of Service."

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN attempts from IPs like 45.121.95.154 and 167.246.129.103 for potential scanning or brute force activity.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if scanning is part of a larger attack pattern.
