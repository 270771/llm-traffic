Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 6th column after source IP and port: here it is "1"), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to determine if there is underlying network misconfiguration or other issues causing these responses. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
