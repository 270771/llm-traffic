Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request, but there is only a single such record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination. A ping flood requires a sustained high rate of ICMP echo requests (type 8), which is not evident here.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no ping flood or other clear attack pattern is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 11 message if it recurs frequently, as it may indicate network routing or TTL issues but is not an attack.
