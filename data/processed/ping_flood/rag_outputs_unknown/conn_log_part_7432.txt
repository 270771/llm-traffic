Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first ICMP entry shows type 128, which is an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8). The second entry shows ICMP type 0, which is an Echo Reply, not type 8 either. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to be sent in high volume, these entries do not match the required ICMP type for a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or spikes in Echo Requests.  
- Verify if other types of ICMP-based attacks or network anomalies are present.
