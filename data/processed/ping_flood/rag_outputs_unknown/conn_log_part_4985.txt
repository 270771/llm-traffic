Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), possibly scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity. Look for heuristics related to TCP SYN floods or port scanning in other logs or anomaly data. Specifically, monitor for repeated SYN packets without completion (S0 state) from the same source IPs to identify possible TCP-based DoS or reconnaissance.
