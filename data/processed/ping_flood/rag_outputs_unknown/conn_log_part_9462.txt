Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings). However, there are only two isolated ICMP echo requests from different source IPs (133.215.16.70 and 133.215.16.77) to the same destination (52.222.245.10) at the same timestamp. This volume and pattern do not indicate a flood, which would require a high rate or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 8 is the only relevant type for ping floods and the traffic volume is minimal, this is normal ping activity rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs. If a sudden surge occurs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate if these pings are part of legitimate network diagnostics or reconnaissance.
