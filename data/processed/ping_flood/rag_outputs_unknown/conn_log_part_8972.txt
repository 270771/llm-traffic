Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is not explicitly given as type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods.  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic between 78.107.26.184 and 133.105.216.49 with a state "OTH" and no indication of type 8.  
- The second entry also shows ICMP traffic between 133.243.19.170 and 23.8.252.167, but again no ICMP type 8 is indicated.  
- Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for ping flood attacks.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest another attack type.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP traffic further by extracting ICMP type codes from packet captures or logs that include ICMP type details.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Review other logs or IDS alerts for related suspicious activity.
