Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since no ICMP traffic is logged, no ping flood pattern is detected.  
- The connections mostly show SYN packets (S0 state) with no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no taxonomy class can be assigned.  
- The observed traffic pattern aligns with typical network scanning or failed connection attempts rather than flooding.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs with repeated SYN attempts (e.g., 92.72.196.229, 89.247.69.*) for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks, including ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP connection attempts.
