Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate a ping flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8 or not present at all, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets for potential scanning or DoS attempts unrelated to ICMP.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood activity.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP Echo Requests to catch future ping floods.
