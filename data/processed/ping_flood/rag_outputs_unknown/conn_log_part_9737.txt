Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows a high volume of ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (54.249.88.129) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007â€“0.008 seconds per packet). This pattern matches known ping flood behavior, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood (commonly assigned heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.88.129 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.45.x.x subnet and one instance from 98.90.102.66 to 203.78.135.92.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.88.129 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or other volumetric attacks.
3. Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting on internal hosts to mitigate impact.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
