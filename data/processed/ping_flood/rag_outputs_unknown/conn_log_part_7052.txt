Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 13, and 128, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, type 13 is Timestamp Request, and type 128 is Echo Reply. These do not match the pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known heuristics or taxonomy classes can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 and 13 messages to ensure they are not part of other reconnaissance or misconfiguration issues.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- If anomalies arise, apply heuristics related to ICMP misuse or denial-of-service as per organizational taxonomy.
