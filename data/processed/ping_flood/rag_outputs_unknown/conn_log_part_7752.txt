Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping. However, it is a single connection with no indication of high volume or flooding. The second entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source to the same destination, this does not match a ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context are unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic spikes from the same IPs, and correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential flooding. Further investigation should focus on traffic volume and rate rather than single connection entries.
