Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows numerous ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) sent from multiple source IPs within the 133.243.x.x range targeting a single destination IP 44.202.236.101 in a very short time frame. This pattern of many ICMP echo requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, this aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources such as 133.243.137.197, 133.243.244.37, 133.243.95.253, etc., targeting destination IP 44.202.236.101 on ICMP type 8 (echo request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.243.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 44.202.236.101 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.
