Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 189.111.223.250, with a single packet and no signs of flooding (only 1 packet, no high frequency or volume).  
- Other ICMP entries either have type 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.  

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.  
- The OTH (Other) connection state and low packet counts further support no ongoing attack.  

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual ICMP types if they appear.
