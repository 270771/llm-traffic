Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic is likely benign or related to network diagnostics rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate if the ICMP Timestamp Requests are unusually frequent or part of a reconnaissance effort. Monitor for any escalation to ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
