Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- All connections have protocol values 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP), with no ICMP protocol (1) entries.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or unusual ICMP traffic patterns.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to ensure no ping flood attempts are missed.
