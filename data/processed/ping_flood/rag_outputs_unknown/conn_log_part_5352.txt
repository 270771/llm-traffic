Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood is occurring.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be referenced. However, the traffic shows many TCP connection attempts with SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts for potential port scanning or reconnaissance. Monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs and consider applying heuristics related to scanning (e.g., heuristic for SYN scan detection) once anomaly data or heuristic context is available.
