Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify ping floods. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is present.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristics and taxonomy cannot be assigned due to lack of relevant data. Next steps: specifically investigate ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods, and correlate with network performance metrics for signs of volumetric ICMP attacks.
