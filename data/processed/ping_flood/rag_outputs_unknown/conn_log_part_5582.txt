Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP traffic entries have an ICMP type field value of 1 or 0 (the 5th field after source IP and port), none have type 8, which is required for an ICMP echo request (ping) flood. Since the ICMP type is not 8, these packets do not represent ping requests and thus do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The traffic appears to be ICMP messages other than echo requests, possibly error or informational messages.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 0 and 1 in these flows to confirm if they correspond to legitimate responses or error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, correlate with additional logs or anomaly detection tools for further analysis.
