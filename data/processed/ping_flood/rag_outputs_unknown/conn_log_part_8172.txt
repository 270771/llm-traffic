Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs (210.162.64.93, 210.162.67.196, 130.187.39.76, 130.187.17.56, 210.162.67.2) targeting the same destination IPs (140.191.0.181, 52.45.247.73) strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attack pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- The most likely heuristic number would be "Heuristic 1: High volume ICMP Echo Requests targeting a single or few hosts," and taxonomy class "DoS: ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Sources: 210.162.64.93, 210.162.67.196, 130.187.39.76, 130.187.17.56, 210.162.67.2
- Destinations: 140.191.0.181, 52.45.247.73
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted hosts (140.191.0.181, 52.45.247.73) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or irrelevant regions.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other signs of coordinated attacks and review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled.
