Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed traffic may represent legitimate ICMP error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 11 messages to determine if there is a routing or network configuration issue causing excessive Time Exceeded packets. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
