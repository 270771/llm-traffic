Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP entries. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, a single or very limited number of ICMP type 8 packets do not constitute a ping flood. There is no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a target, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, heuristic for ping flood detection involves monitoring for high-rate ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs showing a high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (124.226.202.203) to the destination (163.45.21.72).  
- Monitor for patterns of sustained ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for potential denial-of-service symptoms.
