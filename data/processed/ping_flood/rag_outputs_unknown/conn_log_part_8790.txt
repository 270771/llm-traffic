Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP connections are targeting the same destination IP 3.29.24.223.
- All these ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- The volume and concurrency of these echo requests from diverse source IPs within the same timestamp strongly indicate a ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP echo requests.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Since no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy are provided, assign:
  - Heuristic: 1 (High volume ICMP echo requests indicating DoS)
  - Taxonomy: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 3.29.24.223 (destination)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.119.22, 157.206.245.149, 157.206.210.238, 157.206.169.2, 157.206.75.110, 157.206.12.163, 157.206.75.125, 157.206.227.126, 157.206.115.14, 157.206.149.174, 157.206.162.241, 157.206.149.1, etc.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but type 8 (Echo Request) is the key indicator.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.29.24.223 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood-specific IDS signatures.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
- If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
