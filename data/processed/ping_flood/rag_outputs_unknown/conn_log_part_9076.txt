Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request) but only a single connection with a very short duration (0.004882 seconds) and no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or connection counts involving ICMP type 8.
