Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 8 and 128. ICMP type 8 corresponds to an Echo Request (ping), but the other entry shows type 128, which is an ICMPv6 Echo Request. However, the volume and pattern of traffic do not indicate floodingâ€”only single or very few packets are logged with no signs of rapid repetition or overwhelming traffic. Additionally, the connection states are OTH (other) and flags do not indicate sustained or excessive traffic.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from a single source to a target, which is not evident here.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these IPs. Investigate if these hosts are generating unusually high ICMP traffic over time, which could indicate early stages of a ping flood or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
