Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- Specifically, there are no records indicating ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack.  
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, the traffic cannot match the known ping flood pattern.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no heuristic or taxonomy can be directly referenced. However, the absence of ICMP echo requests excludes ping flood by definition.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, ensuring ICMP logs are enabled.  
- Monitor for other types of DoS or scanning activity, as many TCP SYN attempts with S0 flags are visible, which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not flooding.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to catch potential future ping floods.
