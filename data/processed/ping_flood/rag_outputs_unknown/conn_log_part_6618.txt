Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed, but the Zeek conn.log entry indicates ICMP protocol with no further detail on type 8 (Echo Request). Without ICMP type 8, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection states but is not sufficient to classify this as a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of this ICMP traffic further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in logs. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the source IP 202.125.201.9 to destination 167.246.129.97 to confirm or rule out ping flood activity.
