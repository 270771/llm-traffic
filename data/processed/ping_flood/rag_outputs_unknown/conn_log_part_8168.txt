Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, and type 11 indicates Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages and not indicative of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic is typical network behavior and does not suggest an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the volume of ICMP type 3 or 11 messages is abnormally high, which could indicate network issues or other anomalies.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
