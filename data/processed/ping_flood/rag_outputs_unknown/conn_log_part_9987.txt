Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows numerous ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages (ping).
- Multiple source IPs, especially 54.251.127.36, are sending a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps clustered around 1641013236).
- The intervals between packets from the same source are extremely low (sub-second), consistent with rapid-fire ICMP echo requests typical of a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern matches known ping flood behavior: high-rate ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming target hosts.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Primary attacker/source IP: 54.251.127.36 (sending ICMP type 8 packets).
- Other sources involved: 133.227.205.2, 133.227.151.1, 133.227.6.121, 133.227.223.200, 133.243.5.1 also sending ICMP type 8.
- Destination IPs include multiple 203.78.x.x and 44.194.4.248, 209.125.92.250, etc.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 54.251.127.36.
- Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or new sources of ICMP floods.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known malicious actors.
- Review firewall and router configurations to drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests and prevent amplification.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.
