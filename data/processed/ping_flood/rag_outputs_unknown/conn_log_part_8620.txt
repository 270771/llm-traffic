Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- Multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) are sent rapidly to the same destination IP (163.84.73.84) from different source IPs (157.206.243.249, 157.206.143.4, 133.243.109.14, 133.243.220.26, 157.206.89.6) within milliseconds.
- The very short inter-arrival times (e.g., 0.000002 to 0.000148 seconds) and repeated ICMP Echo Requests indicate a high volume of ping traffic consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type 8 confirms these are Echo Requests, which are the basis of ping flood attacks.
- No anomaly CSV data or heuristic context is provided, but by standard taxonomy, this matches a volumetric ICMP flood attack (likely heuristic #1: ICMP flood detection, taxonomy class: Network DoS).

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: 157.206.243.249, 157.206.143.4, 133.243.109.14, 133.243.220.26, 157.206.89.6
- Destination IP: 163.84.73.84
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the victim host (163.84.73.84) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with network teams to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
