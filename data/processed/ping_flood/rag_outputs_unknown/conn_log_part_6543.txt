Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP echo requests (type 8), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The observed ICMP type 1 messages could indicate network issues or scanning activity but are not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (210.162.66.9) and destination IPs (89.247.69.187, 58.36.200.2) for unusual behavior or repeated unreachable messages. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns.
