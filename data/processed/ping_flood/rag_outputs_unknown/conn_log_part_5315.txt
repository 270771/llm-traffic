Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks and no ICMP traffic is logged, there is no evidence of a ping flood. The absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood pattern is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, SYN scans or connection attempts would fall under reconnaissance heuristics, but this is outside the scope of ping flood detection.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically. Enable or review ICMP logs to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks. Also, monitor for high volumes of SYN packets that may indicate scanning or other DoS attempts.
