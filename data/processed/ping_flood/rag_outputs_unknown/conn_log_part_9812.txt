Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP types 3 and 0, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to destination unreachable (type 3) and echo reply (type 0), which may indicate normal network behavior or other ICMP-related activity but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP traffic over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based attacks or network issues. Monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs is recommended.
