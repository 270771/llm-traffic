Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, no ping flood is detected.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the network for ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping floods. Also, review firewall or IDS logs for unusual ICMP echo request rates. Further analysis of TCP SYN scans could be warranted to identify reconnaissance activity.
