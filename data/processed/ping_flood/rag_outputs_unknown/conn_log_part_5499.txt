Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic shows multiple TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no ICMP type 8 traffic is present, the heuristic for ping flood (which requires ICMP Echo Requests) does not apply.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics, typically classified under "Network Scanning" or "Reconnaissance" taxonomy.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with S0 state for potential scanning or SYN flood attempts.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these TCP attempts are part of a broader attack pattern.
