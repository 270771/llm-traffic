Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the port fields, which are both zero (source port 11, destination port 0). However, ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood, and here the destination port is 0, which does not correspond to ICMP type 8. Additionally, the connection state is OTH (other), which does not indicate a typical flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. Given the lack of evidence for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack, no immediate security incident is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) with high frequency from the same source IP (150.227.97.96) to the destination IP (163.84.31.20). If such patterns emerge, further investigation should be initiated.
