Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 13, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 11 and 13 are typically related to network diagnostics or error messages, not flooding attacks.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (203.78.136.177 and 133.243.229.91) for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, but no immediate ping flood response is warranted. Monitoring for a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be necessary to detect a ping flood.
