Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are the basis of ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic applies here.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages, as they may indicate network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics rather than an attack.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or anomalies in connection rates that could signal emerging ping flood attempts.
