Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from the same source IP (54.236.220.60) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.01 seconds apart). This pattern of rapid ICMP Echo Requests to various targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood attacks typically involves detecting high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to one or more destinations. The taxonomy class would be "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Attacker/source: 54.236.220.60 (ICMP type 8 Echo Requests)
  - Targets/destinations: 163.45.179.54, 163.45.11.39, 163.45.253.102
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here (type 8).

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from 54.236.220.60.
- Monitor for continued or escalating ICMP traffic from this source and other suspicious IPs.
- Notify affected network owners of the targeted IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Collect and preserve logs for forensic analysis and potential legal action.
