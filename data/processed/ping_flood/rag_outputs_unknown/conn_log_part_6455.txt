Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which is not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. ICMP type `0` corresponds to Echo Reply, which does not indicate a ping flood attack. No anomalies or heuristics are provided to suggest another attack type.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The connection state `OTH` and flags do not indicate a typical flood pattern.

Next steps: Investigate if there are multiple Echo Request (ICMP type 8) entries from the same source IP in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods. Also, monitor for other ICMP types or unusual traffic patterns that may indicate different attacks.
