Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entries show multiple ICMP connections with various ICMP types. Only entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are relevant for ping flood detection.  
- Among the entries, only two have ICMP type 8:  
  - 85.22.185.156 → 133.105.156.169  
  - 172.23.68.231 → 163.45.59.82  
- However, these entries show very low counts (1 packet each) and no signs of rapid repeated requests or high volume typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are unrelated to ping floods and indicate different ICMP messages (Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. By default, ping flood heuristics require sustained high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential network issues or other attack types (e.g., scanning or misconfiguration).  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns to better detect anomalies in the future.
