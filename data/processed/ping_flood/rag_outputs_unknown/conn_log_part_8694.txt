Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to an ICMP Time Exceeded message, not type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the ICMP type alone is sufficient to rule out a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 202.250.216.227 and destination IP 167.46.181.116 for potential network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics, as ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or routing problems, not attacks.
