Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type is not explicitly listed as 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The first entry has ICMP type 58, and the second entry has ICMP type 1, neither of which corresponds to Echo Request. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP types (1 = Destination Unreachable, 58 = Neighbor Discovery) suggest normal network control messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the volume and frequency of ICMP type 1 and 58 messages to ensure they are within normal operational parameters.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) which would indicate potential ping flood activity.
