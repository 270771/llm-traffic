Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded.
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, the condition for identifying a ping flood is not met.
- The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context further supports that no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy data, the closest classification for these entries would be reconnaissance or scanning activity, not a denial-of-service via ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if these TCP attempts are part of a broader scanning campaign.
