Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic with no indication of ICMP packets, let alone ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) which is required to identify a ping flood. The log entries have protocol field as "tcp" and no ICMP type or code fields are present. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN packets with no successful handshakes (S0 state), which may suggest scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, failed TCP connection attempts (S0) could relate to reconnaissance or scanning heuristics.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs with repeated failed TCP connection attempts for potential scanning activity. Collect ICMP traffic logs to verify if any ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks occur. Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP type 8 floods to catch ping floods in the future.
