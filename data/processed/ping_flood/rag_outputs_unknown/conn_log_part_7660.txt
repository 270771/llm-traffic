Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries show a type value of 8, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Request (ping). However, the logs indicate only single isolated ICMP packets (count = 1) from each source IP to different destination IPs, without evidence of high-frequency or volumetric traffic typical of a ping flood attack. Additionally, the connection state is "OTH" (other), and flags do not indicate repeated or sustained traffic.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since no flood pattern or volume is detected, this traffic does not match a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP traffic volume or repeated requests from the same source IPs. If multiple ICMP Echo Requests occur in rapid succession from one or more IPs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
