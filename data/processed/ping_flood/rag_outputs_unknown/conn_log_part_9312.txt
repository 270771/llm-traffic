Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets sent from numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.227.137.194, 133.227.221.1, 133.227.135.131, etc.) targeting a single destination IP (100.84.99.85) within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641013232.748995 to 1641013232.752110). This pattern of many ICMP echo requests flooding one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single target, overwhelming the targetâ€™s network stack.
- The most likely heuristic number would be "ICMP Flood Detection" (commonly heuristic #3 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.227.x.x range; destination IP: 100.84.99.85; ICMP type: 8 (echo request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type confirms the ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 100.84.99.85.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor network and host performance on 100.84.99.85 for signs of degradation or compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or blackholing traffic from suspicious sources.
