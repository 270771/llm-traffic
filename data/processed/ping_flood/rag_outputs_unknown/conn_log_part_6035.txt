Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log entries is the 7th field after the source and destination IPs and ports. Here, the ICMP types observed are 10, 3, 0, 1, and 10. None of these are type 8, which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Request (ping). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the presence of ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 0 (Echo Reply), 1 (ICMP Host Unreachable), and 10 (Router Advertisement) suggests normal or other diagnostic ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 1 messages if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as these can sometimes indicate network scanning or misconfigurations. Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods to detect ping flood attacks promptly.
