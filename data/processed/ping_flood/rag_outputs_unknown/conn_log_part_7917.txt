Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port, here "icmp" protocol with ICMP type 1), which corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Ping floods specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic context or taxonomy data, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in other logs or timeframes to rule out ping floods. Also, monitor for other ICMP types that may indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
