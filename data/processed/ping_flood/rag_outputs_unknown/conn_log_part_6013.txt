Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 1, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known pattern for ping flooding.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates Destination Unreachable, type 1 is Host Unreachable, and type 0 is Echo Reply, which are not indicative of a ping flood.  

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack classifications. However, the presence of ICMP error messages (type 3 and 1) could indicate network issues or scanning activity worth monitoring.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.58.122, 133.251.128.196, 203.78.143.78) for unusual ICMP error message patterns or potential reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect possible ping floods.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for broader context.
