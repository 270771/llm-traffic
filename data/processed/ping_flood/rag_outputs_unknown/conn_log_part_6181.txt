Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types. The critical detail is the ICMP type field: only type 8 (Echo Request) indicates a ping request relevant to ping flood detection. Here, two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (45.225.96.135 → 133.105.155.168 and 172.23.68.231 → 203.78.188.211), but each connection record shows a single packet (last field = 1), not a flood of repeated requests. The third entry has ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) as source port, which is not a ping flood indicator.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be characterized by a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one or more sources to a target in a short time frame, which is not evident here.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, verify if other ICMP types or unusual flags appear that might indicate different network scanning or reconnaissance activity.
