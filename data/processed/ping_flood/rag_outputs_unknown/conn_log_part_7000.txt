Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 61.134.196.250 to destination 149.65.71.1, with a single packet (count=0 or 1) and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11, 13) are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly evident from the snippet, no immediate alert is warranted. However, the single ICMP Echo Request should be monitored if it increases in frequency.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP Echo Requests from 61.134.196.250 for any surge in volume or rate that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden increase in ICMP traffic volume or repeated Echo Requests from any source IP.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP flood detection, such as threshold counts or rate limits, to automate future detection.
