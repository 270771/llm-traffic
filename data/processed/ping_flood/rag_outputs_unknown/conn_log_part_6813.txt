Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 35.83.191.13 to destination 163.45.192.105, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0 or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or classify this traffic as an attack.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request without volume or frequency anomalies does not meet criteria for a ping flood.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 35.83.191.13 generates multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, which could indicate early stages of a ping flood.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics and other logs to detect potential escalation.
