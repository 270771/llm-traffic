Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP packets originating from the same source IP (173.20.80.33) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) sent to multiple destination IPs (163.45.128.78, 163.45.128.83, 163.45.128.84, 163.45.128.76) within a very short time frame (~0.01 seconds). This pattern of rapid ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches the classic heuristic of "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations in a short time," which typically falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 173.20.80.33; Destination IPs 163.45.128.78, 163.45.128.83, 163.45.128.84, 163.45.128.76.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 confirms Echo Request packets.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 173.20.80.33 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 173.20.80.33 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
