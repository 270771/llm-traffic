Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 13, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets used in ping floods. Types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 13 (Timestamp Request) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no known ping flood heuristics apply here.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.227.159.6 and 130.187.3.104) for unusual ICMP activity patterns or other anomalies.  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets or high-volume ICMP traffic that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks.
