Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = 6).
- There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to indicate ping activity.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic, a ping flood cannot be occurring.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.
- The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.
- The observed TCP SYN attempts could be investigated as potential reconnaissance or scanning activity, which typically falls under heuristic categories related to network scanning or probing.

Next Steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion to rule out SYN flood or scanning attacks.
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious IPs or ports.
