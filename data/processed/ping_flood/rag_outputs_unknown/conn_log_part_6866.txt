Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.111.121, 133.243.211.6, 133.243.223.11, etc.) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 3.192.28.218 in a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood where many hosts simultaneously flood a target with echo requests to overwhelm it.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy entries are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources in the 133.243.x.x range targeting destination 3.192.28.218. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/protocol indicator.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at network perimeter devices targeting 3.192.28.218.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact on the target host and consider upstream provider support for traffic filtering or blackholing if attack volume escalates.
