Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0`, which indicates an ICMP Echo Reply, not an Echo Request (type 8) required for a ping flood. Since the traffic is ICMP but not type 8, it does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other suspicious activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 223.116.60.11 and destination IP 203.78.143.78 for any other unusual traffic patterns or anomalies in other logs, especially looking for ICMP Echo Requests or high-volume ICMP traffic that might indicate reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
