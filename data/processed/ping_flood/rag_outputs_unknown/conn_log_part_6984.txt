Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

The observed ICMP types correspond to:
- Type 11: Time Exceeded (often related to traceroute or routing issues)
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable (indicates network or host unreachable)

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest these are part of a different attack. However, these ICMP messages could indicate network troubleshooting or misconfiguration rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (202.101.171.238 and 202.125.201.18) for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns over a longer time window to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
