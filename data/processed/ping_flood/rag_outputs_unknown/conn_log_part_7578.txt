Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3, 11, or 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network error or diagnostic messages, not attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are legitimate network diagnostics and not part of a reconnaissance or other attack.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
