Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are provided, so no direct correlation to known attack patterns is possible.  

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic context or anomaly data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy class applies here.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (128.12.65.229 and 203.78.134.15) for potential misconfigurations or other suspicious activity, as ICMP type 3 and 11 messages can indicate network issues or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect possible future ping flood attempts.
