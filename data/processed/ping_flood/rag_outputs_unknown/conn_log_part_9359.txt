Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.183.178.87) from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013232.97x).
- ICMP type 8 is the echo request used in ping floods.
- The volume and distribution of these echo requests from multiple sources to one target strongly match a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 54.183.178.87 (ICMP type 8, no ports applicable)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.21.99, 157.206.111.23, 157.206.88.26, 157.206.196.253, 157.206.155.201, 157.206.15.134, 157.206.252.138, 157.206.155.222, 157.206.15.27, 157.206.155.18, 157.206.49.34, 157.206.245.141, 157.206.34.196, 157.206.234.251.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests targeting 54.183.178.87.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP echo responses on the affected host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
