Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.199.185.249 from many different source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.366 to 1641013233.369). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with ICMP traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.199.185.249 (ICMP type 8, no ports since ICMP)  
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.206.160.2, 157.206.252.158, 157.206.245.247, 157.206.163.136, 157.206.3.163, 157.206.147.125, 157.206.63.1, 157.206.63.229, 157.206.75.186, and 133.243.9.5.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.199.185.249.  
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and prepare to escalate to incident response if service degradation occurs.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
