Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), and the second entry has ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). While ICMP type 8 is used in ping floods, there is only a single echo request recorded, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a flood. The other ICMP type (11) is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other signs of flooding, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks. Also, consider correlating with network bandwidth and latency anomalies to detect volumetric attacks.
