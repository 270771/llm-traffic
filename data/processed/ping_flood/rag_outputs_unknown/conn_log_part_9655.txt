Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `0` respectively, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) to overwhelm the target, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The observed ICMP types correspond to other ICMP message types (type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 0 = Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for other suspicious activity, as ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) can indicate network issues or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If available, correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify any emerging threats.
