Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 3 and 8. According to the criteria, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, one entry has ICMP type 8 (151.105.96.5 â†’ 133.105.230.236), but it is a single packet (count=0 or 1) and does not indicate a flood pattern (high volume or rapid repeated requests). The other entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of repeated ICMP type 8 packets or high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Apply heuristics for ICMP flood detection once available, focusing on packet rate thresholds and source IP behavior.
