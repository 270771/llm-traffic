Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, no related heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The absence of ICMP traffic suggests no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is occurring.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log here does not show ICMP records.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other attack types such as TCP SYN floods or UDP floods, as many entries show TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.
