Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. This traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. Since ICMP type 11 is typically used for diagnostic or routing purposes, this traffic appears benign.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood, but monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is recommended as a next step.
