Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8, which corresponds to Echo Request messages used in ping operations. The entries occur within milliseconds of each other from multiple source IPs (133.243.206.29, 133.243.25.44, 133.243.224.59, 133.243.25.40) targeting different destination IPs, indicating a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests to consume bandwidth and resources.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is a high-rate ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies).  
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: 133.243.206.29, 133.243.25.44, 133.243.224.59, 133.243.25.40  
- Destination IPs: 23.182.90.0, 104.86.20.252, 35.72.129.52  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.  
4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse and consider blacklisting if confirmed malicious.  
6. Inform affected parties of the attack and prepare mitigation strategies to maintain service availability.
