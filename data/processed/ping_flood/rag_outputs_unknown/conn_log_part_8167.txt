Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0, 3, or 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No other clear attack pattern is evident from the given data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network diagnostic or error messages, not flooding attacks.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if further investigation is warranted, focus should be on monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume spikes and correlating with other network indicators of compromise.
