Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets sent in high volume, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, so no heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned. The observed traffic may indicate network scanning or error messages but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs (163.45.135.184 and 203.78.142.13) for unusual ICMP error message patterns or other suspicious activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.
