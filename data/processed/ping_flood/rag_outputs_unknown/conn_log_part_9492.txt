Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the port field being 0, which corresponds to ICMP type code in Zeek logs), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The connection state "OTH" and flags "F F" indicate other connection states but do not imply flooding or scanning.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm ICMP types and payloads. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential ping floods.
