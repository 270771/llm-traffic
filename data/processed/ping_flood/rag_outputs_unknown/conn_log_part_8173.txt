Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 8 and 0. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is relevant for ping floods, but type 0 corresponds to Echo Reply. The third entry has ICMP type 0, which is not indicative of a ping flood. However, the volume and frequency of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in the snippet are very low (only two entries), and there is no evidence of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting a high rate of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from one or more sources targeting a victim IP.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume and latency metrics to detect potential denial-of-service conditions.  
- Investigate the source IPs 130.187.39.227 and 133.227.134.152 for any other suspicious activity, as they are sending ICMP Echo Requests.
