Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 0 or 1, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the known criterion for ping flood detection requires ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) traffic to ensure they are not part of other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets, which would indicate potential ping flood activity.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
