Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 151.105.96.5 to two different destination IPs (133.105.230.231 and 133.105.230.227). However, the number of packets is very low (only 1 packet per connection), and there is no indication of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to a single destination that would characterize a ping flood.

The other ICMP entry (from 202.250.216.227 to 172.23.14.184) has ICMP type 11, which is not type 8, so it does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy and heuristic related to ICMP flood detection.

Next steps:  
Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, review network device logs and traffic patterns for other DoS indicators.
