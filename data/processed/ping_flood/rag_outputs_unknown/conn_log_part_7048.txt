Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 0 (echo reply), not 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood attack. This traffic represents a single ICMP echo reply from 133.251.79.192 to 124.226.202.203, not a flood of echo requests.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally, heuristic #1 would relate to high-volume ICMP echo requests (type 8) indicating ping floods, and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" would apply. Since this is a single echo reply, it does not match those criteria.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential flooding.
