Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 13 (timestamp request), which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood. The second entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), but it shows only a single packet with no signs of flooding (no high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination).

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, there is no evidence of a ping flood or any other attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time frame to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or anomalies in ICMP traffic volume.  
- Establish heuristics to flag excessive ICMP echo requests (e.g., more than 10 per second from one source) for future detection.
