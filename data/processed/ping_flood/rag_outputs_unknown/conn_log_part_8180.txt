Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.203.247.100) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Target IP: 3.203.247.100 (no port, ICMP protocol)  
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.243.102.15, 133.243.29.54, 133.243.84.165, etc.)  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.203.247.100.  
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.  
4. Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or secondary attacks.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo responses on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
