Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 203.78.143.78 to destination 137.6.246.249, with only 32 packets and a short duration (0.029 seconds). This volume and rate do not indicate a flood. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 10, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 10 (Router Advertisement) are present, these could be normal network control messages rather than attacks.

Next steps:  
Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request volume or rate from any source IP. If a sudden surge of ICMP type 8 packets occurs, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if the ICMP type 3 and 10 messages correspond to legitimate network events or misconfigurations.
