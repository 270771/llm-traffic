Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type values of 3 and 10, not type 8. Since only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets constitute ping floods, these entries do not match ping flood patterns. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," which are normal control messages or potentially indicative of other network conditions but not ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, if these ICMP types were to be considered suspicious, heuristic 3 (ICMP anomaly detection) and taxonomy class "Network Control Message Anomaly" would be relevant.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 messages to ensure no misconfigurations or routing issues exist.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.
