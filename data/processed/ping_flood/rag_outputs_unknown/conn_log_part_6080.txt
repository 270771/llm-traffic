Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 11 (Time Exceeded) or 0 (Echo Reply), but none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed ICMP traffic likely represents normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual volume or patterns of ICMP type 11 or 0 traffic if network issues are suspected.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 floods to detect potential ping flood attacks.
