Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with various types. Notably, the ICMP type values are 0, 3, and 8. According to the instruction, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic is relevant for ping flood detection. Here, the entries with type 8 are isolated single packets from source IPs 151.105.96.5 to different destination IPs (133.105.230.131 and 133.105.230.130), each with a count of 1, indicating no high volume or flood pattern. The other ICMP types (0 and 3) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Therefore, no known heuristic or taxonomy applies here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to the same or multiple destinations, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets for potential network issues or other ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic volume thresholds to detect future flooding attempts.
