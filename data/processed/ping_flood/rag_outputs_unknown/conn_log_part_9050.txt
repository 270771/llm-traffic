Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP types 3 and 10, but none with ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," neither of which correspond to ping flood activity.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages, as a high volume could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping flood attempts.
