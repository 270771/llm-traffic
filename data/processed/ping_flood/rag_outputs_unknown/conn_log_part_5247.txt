Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified from this data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommended next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic logs or packet captures to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for high volumes of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IPs to identify possible ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies or rate-based alerts.  

Heuristic and taxonomy references cannot be assigned due to lack of data.
