Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `0` (indicated by the destination port field being `0` and protocol `icmp`), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods rely on repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No anomaly records are present to suggest other attack types. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic with type 0 (Echo Reply) between IPs 213.211.87.76 and 203.78.143.78 to ensure it is legitimate and not part of a different ICMP-based reconnaissance or reflection attack. Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in future logs for precise analysis.
