Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Even if ICMP traffic were present, the requirement for a ping flood is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not indicated here.  
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), typical of port scans or failed connection attempts, not ICMP floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no anomalies or heuristics are found, no specific heuristic or taxonomy applies here.  
- The observed traffic pattern aligns more with reconnaissance or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next Steps:  
- Investigate the repeated SYN attempts from IPs like 45.121.95.154 and 89.247.66.138 for potential scanning or brute force attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP/UDP connection attempts.
