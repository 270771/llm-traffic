Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first log entry is 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match the ping flood criterion.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 4 (Source Quench), also not type 8.  
- Both entries have the connection state "OTH" (other), indicating incomplete or unusual connection states but not specifically ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, ICMP types 11 and 4 typically relate to network diagnostics or congestion control, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (221.65.217.50 and 133.227.58.120) for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
