Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.39.157.141) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window (all around 1641013233.185xxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is a high-frequency ICMP Echo Request flood (commonly heuristic #1 in many taxonomies), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Victim IP: 3.39.157.141 (destination)
- Multiple attacker IPs: 157.206.157.26, 157.206.10.5, 157.206.205.88, 157.206.23.193, 157.206.144.155, 157.206.58.130, 157.206.244.165, 157.206.115.30, 157.206.115.14, 157.206.23.212, 157.206.103.79, 157.206.228.125, 157.206.101.9, 157.206.251.222, 157.206.251.226, 157.206.244.13, 157.206.23.80, 157.206.10.12, 157.206.119.37, and others.
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Implement ICMP traffic filtering rules to allow only legitimate ICMP traffic (e.g., from trusted hosts).
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or new ICMP flood attempts.
4. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic upstream.
5. Consider deploying DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume escalates.
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP range and remediate accordingly.
