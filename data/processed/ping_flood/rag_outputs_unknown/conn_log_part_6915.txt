Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 202.250.202.134 to 101.6.45.221 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) from 163.45.175.93 to 49.36.187.45, also not type 8.  
- Since neither entry involves ICMP type 8, these are not ping requests and thus do not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. However, ICMP type 3 and 11 messages often indicate network issues or scanning activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for potential reconnaissance or misconfiguration.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood.  
- Collect more detailed logs or enable ICMP-specific anomaly detection heuristics once available.
