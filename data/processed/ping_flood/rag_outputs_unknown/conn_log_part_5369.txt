Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are shown, no ping flood traffic is detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be mostly failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Recommendation: Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state further to determine if this is a port scan or other reconnaissance. Monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests should continue to detect any future ping flood attempts.
