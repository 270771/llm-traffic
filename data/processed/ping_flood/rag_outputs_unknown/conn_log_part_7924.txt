Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 10, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, not type 8 (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, these packets do not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic may represent diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs for unusual ICMP activity patterns or volume over time.  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) floods or other suspicious traffic.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
