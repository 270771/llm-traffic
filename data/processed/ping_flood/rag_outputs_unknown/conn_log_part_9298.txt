Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the Zeek conn.log snippet is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") used in ping floods. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood attack, which requires ICMP type 8 packets.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not indicate an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.78.139.207 and destination IP 27.240.147.91 for unusual ICMP activity or other suspicious behavior, especially if multiple ICMP types or high volumes are observed over time. Monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) is critical to detect potential ping floods.
