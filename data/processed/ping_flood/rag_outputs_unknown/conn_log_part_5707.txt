Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping flood traffic.  
- In the snippet, only one record shows ICMP type 8 as the source port (172.23.68.231 â†’ 133.105.246.172), but it is a single connection with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries either have type 0 (Echo Reply) or type 8 as destination port, which does not match the pattern of a flood originating from multiple Echo Requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

No attack is present. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo request/reply exchanges without flooding characteristics. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any host is generating unusually high ICMP traffic over time to detect potential emerging ping flood attacks.
