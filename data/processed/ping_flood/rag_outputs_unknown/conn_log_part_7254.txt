Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows traffic from 150.227.97.96 to 106.50.153.111 with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Therefore, it does not match the ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP record shows traffic from 59.71.214.64 to 163.45.128.85 with ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), also not type 8. Echo Replies alone do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided to suggest other attack types.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. The ICMP traffic appears to be normal diagnostic or error messages rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for a high volume of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from a single source to a target, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP error messages that could indicate network issues or other attack types.
