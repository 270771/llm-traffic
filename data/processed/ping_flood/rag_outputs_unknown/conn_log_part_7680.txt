Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 151.105.96.5 to 133.105.230.184, but it shows zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic. The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not represent ping floods. The traffic pattern does not match known ping flood characteristics, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attacks. The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) may indicate normal network error messages rather than attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP. If a surge occurs, investigate for potential ping flood. Also, verify if the ICMP error messages correspond to legitimate network issues or misconfigurations.
