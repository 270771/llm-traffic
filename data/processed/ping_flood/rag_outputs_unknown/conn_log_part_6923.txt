Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, these are not ping flood packets.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is often related to traceroute or routing issues rather than flooding, no attack is indicated here.

Next steps: Investigate the source of these ICMP Time Exceeded messages to ensure they are not part of a network misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a future ping flood attempt.
