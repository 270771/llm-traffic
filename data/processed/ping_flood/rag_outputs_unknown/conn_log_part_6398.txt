Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries except one have type 11, which is Time Exceeded, not Echo Request (type 8). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8, but it is a single instance and does not indicate flooding. Ping flood attacks require a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) targeting a host, which is not evident here.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP type 11 traffic could indicate traceroute or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 172.23.68.231 sending the single ICMP Echo Request to 163.45.166.211 to confirm normal behavior. Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential future ping floods.
