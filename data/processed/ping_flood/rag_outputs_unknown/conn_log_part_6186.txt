Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 or 0, not 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and the prompt states that only ICMP type 8 traffic can indicate a ping flood, these entries do not match ping flood criteria. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 is "Echo Reply," neither of which indicate a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP control messages or responses.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any unusual patterns or volumes of ICMP type 3 or 0 messages, as excessive ICMP errors or replies could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If suspicious behavior is observed in other protocols or ports, correlate with additional logs or anomaly data once available.
