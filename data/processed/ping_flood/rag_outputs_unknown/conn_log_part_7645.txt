Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 3, which is a "Destination Unreachable" message, not an echo request (type 8). The second entry has ICMP type 8, which is an echo request (ping), but there is only a single instance with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.

No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination or a high volume of such packets, this does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 151.105.96.5 sending ICMP echo requests if the volume increases, as it could indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Since no heuristics or taxonomy are provided, consider applying standard ICMP flood detection heuristics focusing on packet rate thresholds and source IP behavior.
