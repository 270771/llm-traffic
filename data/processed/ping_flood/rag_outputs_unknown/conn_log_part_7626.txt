Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged here, no ping flood traffic is detected.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The traffic appears to be a series of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets for potential SYN scan or reconnaissance activity. Apply heuristics related to TCP SYN flood or scanning if available, and monitor for repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.
