Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type for the majority of traffic from 161.4.15.91 is 8, which corresponds to Echo Request (ping). However, the number of connections is very low (each entry shows a count of 1), and there is no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from a single source to a single destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. Other ICMP types present (11, 128, 3) are unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Typically, a ping flood would be classified under a DoS (Denial of Service) taxonomy with a heuristic related to ICMP Echo Request flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from single sources to single destinations. If volume spikes significantly, investigate for potential ICMP flood. Also, consider correlating with network bandwidth and latency metrics to detect subtle DoS attempts.
