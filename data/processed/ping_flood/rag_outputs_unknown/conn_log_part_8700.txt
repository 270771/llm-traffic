Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is from IP 133.243.75.87 to 173.20.80.35, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the presence of ICMP types 0 (Echo Reply) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) suggests normal ICMP communication or possible network troubleshooting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets in high volume from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network misconfigurations or routing issues.
