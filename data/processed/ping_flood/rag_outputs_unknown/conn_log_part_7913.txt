Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The first log entry shows ICMP traffic with type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only a single connection record with a single packet (orig_pkts=1) and no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood. The second entry is ICMP type 13 (timestamp request), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious behavior here. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other signs of flooding, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No attack is present. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at a high rate. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ICMP flood attacks.
