Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26) from many distinct source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms the victim with excessive ping requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "Excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target."  
- Taxonomy class: "Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Source IPs: Multiple from the 157.206.x.x range and others (e.g., 133.227.58.122).  
- Destination IPs: Primarily 54.183.178.87 and 69.232.166.26.  
- ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are irrelevant here.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs targeting the victim IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention systems (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and identify if this is part of a larger distributed attack.  
4. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.  
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical assets if business operations allow.  
6. Conduct a forensic review of source IPs to determine if they are spoofed or compromised hosts.
