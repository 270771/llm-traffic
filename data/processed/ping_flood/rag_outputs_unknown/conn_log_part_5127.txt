Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP or UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply here. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic (commonly related to ICMP Echo Request floods) is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the TCP SYN flood possibility, as many entries show TCP connections with SYN flags set and no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Enable ICMP logging to capture potential ICMP-based attacks in the future.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for further anomaly detection.
