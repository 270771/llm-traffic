Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `3` and `11`, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, respectivelyâ€”not type `8` (Echo Request) which is required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no related heuristics or taxonomy classes can be assigned. The observed ICMP types suggest network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not symptomatic of network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood.
