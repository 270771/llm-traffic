Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 151.105.96.5 to destination 133.105.230.22, but there is only a single such record with no indication of high frequency or volume typical of a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (13, 1, 0) are not Echo Requests and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior related to these IPs or traffic patterns.

Heuristic and Taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned.  
- The lack of multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets excludes the presence of a ping flood.

Next Steps:  
- Monitor for repeated or high-rate ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) and type 1 (Destination Unreachable) entries if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
