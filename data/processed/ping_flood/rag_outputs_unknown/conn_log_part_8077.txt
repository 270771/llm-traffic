Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8. Since ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), and neither entry matches this, the traffic does not represent a ping flood. ICMP type 3 is Destination Unreachable, and type 11 is Time Exceeded, which are normal control messages or could indicate other network issues but not a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. If further investigation is warranted, focus should be on analyzing the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, which might indicate network misconfigurations or other issues unrelated to ping floods.
