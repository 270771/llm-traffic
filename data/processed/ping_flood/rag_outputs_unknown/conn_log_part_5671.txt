Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows three ICMP connections with types 11, 8, and 3 respectively. According to the known rule, only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) traffic can indicate a ping flood. Here, there is only a single ICMP type 8 record (from 172.23.68.231 to 133.105.148.226) with a count of 0 packets and 0 bytes, which does not indicate flooding or high volume. The other ICMP types are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not related to ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of repeated or high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic means no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type 8 traffic further if volume increases or if multiple sources target the same destination.  
- Monitor for other ICMP-based anomalies such as ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) which may indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
