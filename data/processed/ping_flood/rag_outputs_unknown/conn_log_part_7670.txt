Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 11 and 8. ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not echo requests used in ping floods. The only ICMP type 8 entries (echo request) show zero packets and zero bytes transferred, indicating no actual ping traffic. Therefore, no evidence of a ping flood is present.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Since ICMP type 11 is related to diagnostic messages rather than flooding, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps: Investigate why there are multiple ICMP Time Exceeded messages, as this could indicate routing issues or traceroute activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo request volume to detect potential future ping floods.
