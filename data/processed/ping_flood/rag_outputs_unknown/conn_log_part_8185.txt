Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type values other than 8 (echo request). Since ping flood attacks specifically require ICMP type 8 packets to overwhelm the target with echo requests, these entries do not match the known pattern for a ping flood. The ICMP type values here are mostly 1 or 10, which correspond to other ICMP message types (e.g., destination unreachable, timestamp request), not echo requests.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the absence of ICMP type 8 traffic excludes the possibility of a ping flood under the known heuristic that "If the ICMP type is not 8, it is not a ping flood."

Next steps: Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 1 and 10 traffic to determine if it indicates other network issues or reconnaissance activity. Specifically, verify if these ICMP messages are symptomatic of network scanning, misconfigurations, or other ICMP-based attacks. Monitoring for unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns could be warranted.
