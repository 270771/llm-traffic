Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries, but only three entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only type relevant for ping floods. These three entries are from different source IPs (133.243.69.38, 133.243.153.231, 133.243.153.148) targeting the same destination IP (35.72.129.52). However, the volume and frequency of these echo requests are very low (single packets each), and there is no indication of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source flooding a target.

Other ICMP types present (0, 1, 11) are not related to ping floods and do not indicate this attack type.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. Generally, a ping flood heuristic would involve detecting high-rate ICMP type 8 traffic from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the three source IPs sending echo requests to 35.72.129.52 for any unusual behavior or correlation with other alerts.  
- Enable or configure anomaly detection rules to flag high-rate ICMP echo request traffic consistent with ping flood patterns.
