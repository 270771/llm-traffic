Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type fields are `11` and `3` respectively, neither of which is type `8` (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

- ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, often related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.
- ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable" messages, indicating network or host unreachable errors.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, based on standard ICMP behavior:

- ICMP type 11 and 3 messages are typically diagnostic or error messages, not indicative of a DoS attack.
- The connection states are `OTH` (other), and flags show no retransmissions or unusual packet counts.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure there are no underlying network misconfigurations or routing issues. Monitor for any increase in volume or changes in ICMP type 8 traffic that could indicate emerging ping flood activity.
