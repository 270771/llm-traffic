Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has a length of 58 bytes but does not specify the ICMP type as 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. Without the ICMP type being 8, this traffic cannot be classified as a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior.

Since no anomalies are detected and the ICMP type is unspecified or not 8, there is no evidence of a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack here.

Next steps: Verify the ICMP type field in future logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic. Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency, which would indicate a ping flood. Also, consider enabling more detailed logging or anomaly detection heuristics to capture such events.
