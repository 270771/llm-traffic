Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8 (Echo Request). In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (from 137.87.92.228 to 202.250.239.187 and from 172.23.68.231 to 133.251.111.16). However, these are isolated single connections with a count of 1 packet each, not a high volume or rapid succession indicative of a flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious patterns or taxonomy classes are matched.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs at high frequency to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 11 and 3 messages if unusual volumes appear, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.  
- Establish heuristics for ICMP flood detection based on volume thresholds and packet rates.
