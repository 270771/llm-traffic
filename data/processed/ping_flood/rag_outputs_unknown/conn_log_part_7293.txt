Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- Specifically, no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) is logged, which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means no evidence of ping flood patterns such as high-rate ICMP Echo Requests targeting a host.
- No anomaly records are found to suggest suspicious activity.
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no ping flood heuristic applies here.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP logs or other network monitoring data to confirm if any ICMP traffic is present.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or other ICMP types.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for dropped or rate-limited ICMP packets.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here. Typically, heuristic #1 corresponds to ICMP flood detection, and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood" would be assigned if detected.
