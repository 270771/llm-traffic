Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- The first entry (ICMP type 11) is a Time Exceeded message, not a ping request.  
- The second entry (ICMP type 8) is a single Echo Request, but there is no evidence of high volume or repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior.  
- Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default assumption is that no known ping flood heuristic is triggered.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency.  
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.143.78 sends multiple Echo Requests in a short time frame.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP Echo Requests if volume increases.

Heuristic and taxonomy:  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, no classification can be assigned.  
- The current traffic does not match ping flood patterns and thus does not trigger any known heuristic or taxonomy class.
