Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not match ping flood criteria.  
- The second ICMP entry shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records are present to suggest suspicious activity.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, the default interpretation is that no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP at high frequency, which would indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP type 11 traffic if it persists, as it may indicate network issues or other attack types like traceroute abuse.
