Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The connections mostly show SYN packets with no successful completions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of SYN packets with no completion for possible TCP SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Focus on IPs such as 192.0.222.29 and others repeatedly initiating connections. Apply heuristics related to TCP scanning and SYN flood detection for further analysis.
