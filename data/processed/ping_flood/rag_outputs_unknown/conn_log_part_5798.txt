Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field (the 6th column after source IP and port) is not explicitly type 8 (Echo Request). The first entry shows ICMP code 1, and the second shows code 0, but neither confirms type 8. Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent in high volume, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be referenced. However, the connection state "OTH" (other) and low packet counts indicate no sustained flood pattern.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further to determine if they represent other ICMP-based reconnaissance or error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes or type 8 packets dominate, apply heuristics related to ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1: high volume ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "DoS/ICMP Flood."

No current attack is present based on the data provided.
