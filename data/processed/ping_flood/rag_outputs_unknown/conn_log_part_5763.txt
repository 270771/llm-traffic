Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Both ICMP entries have the ICMP type field as 0, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods specifically require ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) sent in high volume, these entries do not match the known ping flood pattern.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. The ICMP traffic observed appears to be other ICMP message types, possibly Echo Replies (type 0) or other control messages, which do not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the nature of these ICMP packets further by capturing full packet details to confirm their exact ICMP types and purposes. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
