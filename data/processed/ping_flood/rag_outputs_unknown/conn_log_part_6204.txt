Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 11 and 3, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request packets, which are used in ping floods. Type 11 is Time Exceeded, and type 3 is Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no known heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here. The traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing ICMP error messages.

Next steps:  
Investigate the cause of the ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) to ensure they are not symptomatic of other network problems or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate a developing ping flood attack.
