Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with types 13 and 1. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for a ping flood attack, but neither entry has type 8. Type 13 corresponds to Timestamp Request, and type 1 corresponds to ICMP Destination Unreachable, neither of which indicate a ping flood.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the absence of ICMP Echo Requests and no anomaly flags, this traffic does not match ping flood or typical ICMP flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source of ICMP Destination Unreachable (type 1) messages to ensure no underlying network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) that could indicate the start of a ping flood attack.  
- If further anomalies appear, correlate with other logs or network behavior for comprehensive analysis.
