Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The first log entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, the second entry shows ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not type 8 and therefore not part of a ping flood. Additionally, the volume and pattern of ICMP traffic in the snippet do not indicate a flood; there are only two entries with no evidence of rapid, repeated echo requests from a single source to a target.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Given the data, no known ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps: Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations, as these can sometimes precede or accompany other network problems. Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic rates to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
