Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The observed traffic may warrant further investigation as ICMP Timestamp Requests can be used for reconnaissance, but it is not indicative of a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets at high volume from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods. Also, consider analyzing other ICMP types for reconnaissance or other attack vectors.
