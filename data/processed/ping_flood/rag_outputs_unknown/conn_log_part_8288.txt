Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic (protocol field = tcp) with no indication of ICMP traffic. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and the presence of only TCP SYN packets with S0 (SYN sent, no reply) flags suggest possible scanning or connection attempts rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no responses (S0 state) for potential SYN scanning or reconnaissance activity. Monitor for repeated connection attempts from the same source IPs and consider applying SYN flood detection heuristics or anomaly detection rules focused on TCP connection patterns.
