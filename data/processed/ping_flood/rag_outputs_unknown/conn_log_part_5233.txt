Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are logged here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.
- The connections show mostly SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.
- The observed traffic could indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity, which should be investigated further by reviewing ICMP logs and network flow data for potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Next steps: Collect and analyze ICMP-specific logs to confirm if any ping flood or other ICMP-based anomalies exist. Also, monitor the source IPs for scanning behavior.
