Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks specifically involve a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8), this traffic does not match the known pattern for a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 messages typically indicate network or host unreachable errors, which may be normal or symptomatic of other network issues but are not indicative of a flooding attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. Generally, ICMP type 3 messages fall under network error reporting rather than attack classifications.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of the frequent ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is a misconfiguration or network routing issue causing unreachable destinations. Monitoring for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) would be prudent to detect potential future ping floods.
