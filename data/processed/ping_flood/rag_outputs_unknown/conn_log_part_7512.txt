Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, and none are visible here, no ping flood is detected.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided TCP connection attempts, which mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), possibly indicating scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the absence of ICMP traffic means no ping flood heuristic applies.

Next steps: Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0) for potential port scanning or reconnaissance activity. Collect ICMP traffic logs to confirm if any ping floods occur outside this snippet.
