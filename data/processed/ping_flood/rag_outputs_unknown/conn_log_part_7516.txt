Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 172.23.68.231 to destination 202.250.246.243, but there is only a single record with no indication of high volume or rapid repeated requests typical of a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types 3, 0, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not match ping flood criteria.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) suggests normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP at a high rate to detect potential future ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in connection logs.
