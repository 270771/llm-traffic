Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Therefore, this traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8).

No anomaly records are found to suggest other attacks. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, the default interpretation is that this is normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps: Investigate if there is a high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (157.206.194.66) in other logs to rule out stealthy ping floods. Also, monitor for other ICMP types that may indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
