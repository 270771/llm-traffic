Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 3.199.185.249 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the standard ping request type. The rapid succession of these requests from multiple source IPs (130.187.195.253, 130.187.195.145, 130.187.195.129, 130.187.49.9, 130.187.49.50) strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #1: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target," and taxonomy class "Network DoS Attack - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses:  
  - Sources: 130.187.195.253, 130.187.195.145, 130.187.195.129, 130.187.49.9, 130.187.49.50  
  - Destination: 3.199.185.249  
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping traffic.
- Recommended security response plan:  
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.  
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.  
  5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious regions or networks.
