Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet show TCP traffic only (protocol field = tcp). There are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood attack. Without ICMP type 8 traffic, this cannot be a ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic appears to be failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP connection attempts with S0 state flags for potential port scanning or brute force attempts. Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or firewall alerts to confirm if these attempts are malicious. Monitoring for ICMP traffic separately is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
