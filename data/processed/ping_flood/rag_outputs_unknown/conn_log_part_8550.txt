Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows a large number of ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP: 163.84.73.84.
- Multiple distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.243.76.6, 157.206.64.254, 133.243.123.255, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession within the same timestamp window (1641013226.8xxxx).
- This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources flooding a single target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack behavior.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: "High volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from multiple sources to a single target."
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically ICMP Flood.
- Assign heuristic number: 1 (commonly used for volumetric ICMP flood detection in standard taxonomies).

Involved IPs and Ports:
- Target IP: 163.84.73.84 (receiving the flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.243.76.6, 157.206.64.254, 133.243.123.255, 157.206.172.6, 133.243.109.2, etc.
- ICMP does not use ports, so port fields are zero or irrelevant.

Recommended Security Response Plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 163.84.73.84.
2. Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for continued or evolving attack patterns.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target host if not required for operations.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve detection heuristics.

This is a clear and active ICMP ping flood attack targeting 163.84.73.84. Immediate mitigation is required to prevent service disruption.
