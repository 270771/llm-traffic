Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows two ICMP connections. The first entry has ICMP type 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping). The second entry has ICMP type 3, which is a destination unreachable message, not related to ping floods. However, there is only a single ICMP echo request recorded, with no evidence of high volume or rapid repeated requests from the same source to the same destination, which is characteristic of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records are present to indicate suspicious behavior, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without multiple rapid ICMP type 8 packets or other indicators such as high packet counts or sustained traffic, this traffic does not match known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP over a short time window to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate the ICMP type 3 message for possible network issues or misconfigurations, as it indicates unreachable destinations.  
- Establish heuristics to flag high-frequency ICMP echo requests if not already in place.
