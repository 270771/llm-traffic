Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there is no ICMP traffic recorded. Since ping flood attacks require ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8), and none are present here, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy references apply. However, the absence of ICMP traffic and the presence of multiple TCP connection attempts with SYN failures (S0 state) suggest possible scanning or reconnaissance activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN attempts with no successful connections (S0) for potential port scanning or other reconnaissance. Correlate with IDS/IPS logs or firewall alerts to confirm scanning behavior and identify if mitigation is needed.
