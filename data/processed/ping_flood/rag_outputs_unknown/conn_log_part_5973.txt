Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log entries show ICMP traffic, but the ICMP type field is missing or represented as "-" (not type 8, which is Echo Request). Since only ICMP type 8 packets constitute ping requests, and none are present, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided. Without evidence of ICMP Echo Requests or unusually high ICMP traffic volume, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP traffic further by capturing full packet details to identify ICMP types and flags.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP error messages that could indicate other types of ICMP-based attacks or network issues.  
- If other suspicious patterns emerge, apply relevant heuristics once available.
