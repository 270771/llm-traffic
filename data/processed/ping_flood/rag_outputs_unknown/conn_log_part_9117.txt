Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP traffic shown has no ICMP type field explicitly listed as 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood. The conn.log entry shows ICMP protocol but lacks details indicating type 8, and the connection state is OTH (other), suggesting no established or typical ping flood pattern. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, no alternative attack type can be confidently identified. The OTH state and zero packet counts indicate no significant suspicious activity.

Next steps: Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP type and code fields in logs to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic. Enable more granular ICMP monitoring to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
