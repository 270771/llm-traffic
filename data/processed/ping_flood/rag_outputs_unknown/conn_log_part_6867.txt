Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple distinct source IPs (all in the 133.243.x.x range) sending ICMP packets of type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 3.192.28.218 within the same second (timestamp 1641013211.7xxxx). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one host is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided, the most likely heuristic is a volumetric ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic #1 in many frameworks: "High volume ICMP Echo Requests to a single target"). The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood".
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in 133.243.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.243.114.27, 133.243.82.151, 133.243.82.172, etc.) targeting destination 3.192.28.218 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.243.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 3.192.28.218 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
  5. Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate similar volumetric ICMP floods in the future.
