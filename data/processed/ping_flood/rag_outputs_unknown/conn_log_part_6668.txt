Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 0, 1, 3, and 11, but none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood attack.  
- ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping floods.  
- The absence of type 8 packets means no classic ping flood pattern is present.

No anomalies or heuristics are explicitly provided, but generally:  
- Heuristic for ping flood would require repeated ICMP type 8 packets from one source to a target.  
- Taxonomy class for ping flood is typically "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to understand if there are network issues or misconfigurations causing these error messages.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.
