Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests is 8. In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines 1 and 3).
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is 2, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP entry (line 2) is type 13, which is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.
- Investigate the source IPs 157.17.54.136 and 133.247.49.34 for unusual activity if ICMP traffic volume increases.
