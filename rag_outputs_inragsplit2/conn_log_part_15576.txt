Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to indicate ping flood, and at least 10 such instances should be observed unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) is triggered by known anomalous IPs. Neither condition is met here.  
- The anomaly record (anomaly_782) references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which aligns with SYN flood or TCP-based attacks, not ICMP ping floods.  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, and taxonomy class 'ptmp' indicates partial TCP message patterns, consistent with SYN flood behavior.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further for potential SYN flood or other TCP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible future ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for SYN flood signatures related to heuristic 10.
