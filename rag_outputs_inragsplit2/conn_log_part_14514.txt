Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV shows only one anomaly (anomaly_782) related to a SYN attack (heuristic 10), which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not referenced in the anomalies or logs.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Since no ICMP traffic or type 8 packets are detected, no ping flood pattern is present.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.
- Monitor for any future ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture if not currently active to ensure visibility into ICMP traffic.
