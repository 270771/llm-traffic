Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The single ICMP Echo Request could be normal network behavior or a benign ping.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.177.156 or destination IP 185.175.64.6 appear in other suspicious contexts.
