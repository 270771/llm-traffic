Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 54.239.183.175. This satisfies the condition of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a high volume of ping requests consistent with a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_54) involving the destination IP 54.239.183.175, categorized under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class for this anomaly is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which falls under the NetworkScanICMP category, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding attacks.
- Source IPs are multiple and varied within the 133.240.x.x subnet, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- The traffic pattern matches a distributed ping flood, where many hosts send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.239.183.175.
2. Investigate the source IPs (133.240.XXX.XXX range) for potential compromise or misuse; consider blacklisting or isolating suspicious hosts.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flooding and correlate with other logs to detect lateral movement or coordinated attacks.
4. Notify the owner/operator of 54.239.183.175 to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate mitigation.
5. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.

Heuristic 20 and taxonomy "ntscICecrqICecrprp" confirm this is a ping flood attack targeting the specified destination IP.
