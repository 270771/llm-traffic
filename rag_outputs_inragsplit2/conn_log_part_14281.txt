Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries do not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The first entry shows ICMP with no type indicated and zero packets; the second entry shows 1 packet with no explicit ICMP type 8.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.  
- Without ICMP type 8 and sufficient packet volume, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect and analyze full ICMP type fields in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies in related logs.
