Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 34.25.134.27 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) targeting 34.25.134.27.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP range.
  4. Implement ingress filtering and consider deploying an ICMP flood mitigation appliance or firewall rules to prevent recurrence.
