Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and only three total ICMP connections are shown, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- If heuristic or taxonomy data becomes available, correlate it with observed traffic for more precise detection.
