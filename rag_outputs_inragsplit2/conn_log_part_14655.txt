Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 within a very short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests; all other ICMP types present are minimal and unrelated.
- No anomaly CSV records are found, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.x.x) are flooding the destination IP 52.237.221.62 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the target host 52.237.221.62 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack.
  5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume escalates to coordinate mitigation.
