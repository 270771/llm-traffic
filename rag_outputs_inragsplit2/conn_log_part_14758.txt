Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types in the log snippet are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically represent error or diagnostic messages, not flooding or DoS attempts.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly generate ICMP error messages, as this could indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.
