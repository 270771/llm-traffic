Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from diverse sources to a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and destination IP 52.181.17.215. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/type.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.181.17.215.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.228.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
  5. If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches the network.
