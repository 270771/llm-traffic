Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal network control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP type 3 messages, as excessive unreachable messages could indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
