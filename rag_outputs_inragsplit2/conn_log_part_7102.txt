Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.230.228.52 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.196.17, 133.247.46.125, 133.247.25.121, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 52.230.228.52 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet and initiate remediation.
