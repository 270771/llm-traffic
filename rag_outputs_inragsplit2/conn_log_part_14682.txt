Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests or known suspicious IPs matching heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
