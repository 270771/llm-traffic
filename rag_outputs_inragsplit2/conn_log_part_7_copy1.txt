Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records or types are shown.
- The anomaly record (anomaly_96) involves source IP 107.81.9.228 targeting port 23 (Telnet) with heuristic 999 labeled as 'mptmp', which does not correspond to ping flood heuristics.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic or at least 10 such instances, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the repeated TCP connections from 107.81.9.228 to port 23, as this may indicate a scanning or brute force attempt (heuristic 999, taxonomy 'mptmp' likely stands for multi-port/multi-target probing).
- Collect ICMP traffic logs to monitor for potential ping floods in the future.
- Implement network monitoring rules to alert on excessive ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect ping floods promptly.
