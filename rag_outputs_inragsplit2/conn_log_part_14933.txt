Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomalies or heuristic matches are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP connection record. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 139.179.133.57 to the destination 203.78.173.223 to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.
