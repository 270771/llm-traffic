Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

No further investigation is required based on this data alone. Monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request volume or suspicious IP behavior is recommended as a next step.
