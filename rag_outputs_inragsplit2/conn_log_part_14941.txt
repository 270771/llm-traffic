Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity (ICMP type 11). Without heuristic context or anomalies, no further attack classification is possible.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP type 11 messages could be a next step to detect potential reconnaissance or network issues.
