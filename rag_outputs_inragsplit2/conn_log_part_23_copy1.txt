Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.239.183.175 within a very short time frame. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and categorizes the anomaly as 'ntscICecrqICecrprp'â€”a NetworkScanICMP class indicating suspicious ICMP traffic consistent with ping flood behavior.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.246.15, 157.161.43.202, 157.161.94.5, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.239.183.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting critical assets.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the 157.161.0.0/16 subnet that may be participating in the attack.
  4. Notify upstream providers and coordinate to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Monitor for any escalation or changes in attack vectors and update firewall/IDS signatures accordingly.
