Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources targeting a single destination, which is clearly observed here.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.22.62, 157.17.106.49, 157.17.14.132, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 161.67.57.135.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other network logs to detect possible coordinated attacks.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
