Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.20.63.105 from multiple source IPs within the 133.240.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies an anomaly (anomaly_57) targeting destination IP 3.20.63.105, categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class from the anomaly record is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which aligns with NetworkScanICMP, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.60.112, 133.240.60.134, 133.240.218.60, etc.) flooding destination IP 3.20.63.105. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.20.63.105.
  2. Investigate and isolate the source IPs within the 133.240.x.x subnet to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  3. Monitor for further anomalous ICMP traffic and correlate with other network logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service on 3.20.63.105.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature tuned to detect and block ICMP flood attacks.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy class.
