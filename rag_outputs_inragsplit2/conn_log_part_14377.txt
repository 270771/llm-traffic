Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly noted (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, indicating a possible SYN flood or SYN scan, not a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve abnormal SYN packets on suspicious ports.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' indicates partial or incomplete TCP handshakes typical of SYN flood attempts.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible ping floods.
