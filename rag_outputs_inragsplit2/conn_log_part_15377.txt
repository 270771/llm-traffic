Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries show ICMP traffic with ICMP type not specified explicitly, but the Zeek conn.log field for ICMP type is missing or marked as "-", so we cannot confirm these are type 8 (Echo Request) packets required for a ping flood.  
- Only 4 ICMP connection entries are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to identify a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold.  
- The connection states are "OTH" (other), and no repeated source-destination pairs or high volume from a single source IP are evident.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type field in more detail to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious behavior.
