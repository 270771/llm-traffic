Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (4th column) in the conn.log entries shows values 3 and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure they are not part of a misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
