Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they show heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (Other), unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs (mostly S0 states indicating SYN packets without completion).

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood possibility further, as heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack patterns.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for SYN flood indicators and consider rate-limiting or blocking suspicious source IPs like 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic separately to detect future ping flood attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack â€” excessive SYN packets causing resource exhaustion.
- Taxonomy 'ptmp': partial TCP message pattern, indicating incomplete TCP handshakes typical in SYN floods.

No evidence supports a ping flood attack at this time.
