Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values present are mostly 3 and 8. However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) from source IP 13.208.10.201 to two different destinations.
- The threshold for a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- The other ICMP types (3) represent destination unreachable messages, not echo requests, and thus do not indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may warrant investigation into network reachability issues or scanning activity, but this is not conclusive of an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 13.208.10.201 for unusual ICMP activity if it persists or escalates.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
