Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only two ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instances are present (from IPs 58.193.7.116 and 13.74.134.236).
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or correlating with other logs to detect slow or distributed ping floods.
