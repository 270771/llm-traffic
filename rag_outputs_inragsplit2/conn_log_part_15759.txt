Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 11, and 3. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (from 69.47.68.54 to two different destinations). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest exceptions or known suspicious IPs matching heuristic 20.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or correlating with other logs for suspicious activity.
