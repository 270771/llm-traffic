Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, these entries likely represent normal or benign ping activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in future anomaly records or if heuristic context becomes available indicating suspicious behavior.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.
