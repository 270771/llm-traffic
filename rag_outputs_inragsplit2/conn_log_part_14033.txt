Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the log snippet are 0, 8, 13, and 1. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one record with ICMP type 8 (first line: src IP 133.247.167.33 to dst IP 107.152.18.85). The count of such instances is 1, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 13 = Timestamp Request, 1 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of various ICMP types may be normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.167.33 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
