Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (18.34.27.210) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type present, fulfilling the requirement that the ICMP type must be 8 for ping flood detection.
- The volume and distribution of sources indicate a coordinated flood rather than normal network behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood / Ping Flood" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and one from 202.202.88.229 range targeting destination IP 18.34.27.210 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.34.27.210.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor the target host for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack traffic before it reaches the internal network.
