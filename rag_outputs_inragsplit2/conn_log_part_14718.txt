Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) to qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The first log entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but only one instance is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to override this threshold or indicate suspicious IPs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if either IP (157.17.104.217 or 8.253.98.5) appears frequently in future logs with ICMP type 8 to reassess.
