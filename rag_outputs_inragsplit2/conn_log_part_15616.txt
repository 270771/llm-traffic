Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "Timestamp Request," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only 1 instance of this ICMP type, far below the threshold of 10 for a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP timestamp request. Timestamp requests are generally benign or used for network diagnostics.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP type 13 packets in suspicious volumes, which could indicate reconnaissance or timing attacks.
