Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 (indicated by the 11 in the 4th field, which is the ICMP type field in Zeek conn.log), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only three ICMP connection entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 packets or anomaly flags, no further investigation into ping floods is warranted.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and increased frequency.
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
