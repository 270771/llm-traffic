Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type is indicated by the destination port field in Zeek conn.log for ICMP traffic, which here is `0`. Since the ICMP type is not 8 (echo request), this traffic does not match the required ICMP type for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic recorded, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack type can be confidently identified. The connection state is `OTH` (other), which may indicate incomplete or unusual connection state but is insufficient to classify this as a ping flood or other attack.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (202.194.17.61) to the destination (162.150.2.191). If multiple echo requests accumulate rapidly, further investigation should be initiated to detect potential ping flood activity.
