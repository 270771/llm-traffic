Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.186.116.19 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is typically "Denial of Service" (DoS).
- Involved IP: Source IP 54.186.116.19; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.186.116.19 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts receiving these pings.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching this attack.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
- Notify upstream providers or the ISP to assist in mitigating the attack if it persists.
