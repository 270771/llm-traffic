Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic signature of a ping flood attack.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is heuristic 20, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Destination IP: 161.67.57.135 (target)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.157.8, 157.17.61.59, 157.17.66.234, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 161.67.57.135.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible.
