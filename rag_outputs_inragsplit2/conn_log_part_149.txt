Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The total number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10.
- No anomaly records or heuristic matches are present to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.
- The traffic appears to be miscellaneous ICMP messages (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out ping flood, and no other anomaly data suggests alternative attacks.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity patterns or other logs.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic.
- Correlate with other network logs or IDS alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
