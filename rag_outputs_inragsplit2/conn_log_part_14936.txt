Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for ping flood detection.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- The source IP 163.171.168.73 is sending rapid ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, so the threshold of 10 instances applies.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack pattern, which would typically be assigned a heuristic related to volumetric ICMP abuse (commonly heuristic 20 or similar in many taxonomies) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" or "Network Flooding."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IP: 163.171.168.73
- Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.252.115.252, 203.78.164.3, 203.78.176.247, 163.252.240.46, 163.252.245.231, 163.252.240.16, 203.78.170.48, 133.251.127.191, 163.252.243.216, 163.252.251.199, 203.78.190.245, 163.252.14.242, 163.252.248.221, 203.78.184.251, 133.102.72.62, 203.78.190.222, 163.252.126.248, 163.252.14.237, 203.78.180.169, 163.252.91.204
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from other sources.
- Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to detect and prevent future ping floods.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial of service impact.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from this source if the attack persists.
