Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (code 3) traffic, not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 code 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable - Port Unreachable," which is a normal network response rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required based on this snippet. However, continued monitoring of ICMP echo requests (type 8) and volume from these IPs is recommended to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
