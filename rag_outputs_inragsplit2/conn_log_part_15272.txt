Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request). Since ping floods require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomalies or heuristics are provided, but the observed ICMP type 3 indicates a different network event, likely an error or unreachable host notification rather than an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed; however, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages could help identify network misconfigurations or connectivity issues.
