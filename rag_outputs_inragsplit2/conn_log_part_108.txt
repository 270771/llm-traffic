Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 157.161.40.85 to 13.57.116.142, and it appears only once.
- All other ICMP entries have type values other than 8 (mostly 0 or 3 or 11), which are not indicative of ping floods.
- There are no at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which is the threshold for detecting a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic or anomaly data is provided here).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages appear sporadically and do not form a pattern of flooding or scanning.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet source (157.161.40.85) if it recurs or increases.
- Collect anomaly and heuristic data to improve detection accuracy.
