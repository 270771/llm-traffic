Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one packet observed. Since a ping flood requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets, this does not meet the threshold for a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection entry. The connection state is OTH (other), and no suspicious flags or volumes are present.

Next steps: Investigate further by collecting more ICMP traffic logs to check for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.228.62.233) to the destination (112.29.130.115). Also, enable detailed ICMP type and code logging to confirm the nature of ICMP packets.
