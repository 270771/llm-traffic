Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.86.31) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP message types.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 34.25.86.31. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 34.25.86.31.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests from multiple sources.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or participation in a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare mitigation such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing if attack volume increases.
