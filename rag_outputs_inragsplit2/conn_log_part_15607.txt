Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 7, 8, and 3. Only one entry has ICMP type 8 (echo request), and it appears only once. The other entries are type 7 (ICMP "record route") and type 3 (destination unreachable).  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. Here, no such anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated, and only one ICMP type 8 instance is logged.  
- No anomaly records are found in the CSV, and no heuristic context is provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports are flagged.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP traffic appears normal or unrelated to flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets from a single source.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for heuristic 20 or similar indicators if they become available.
