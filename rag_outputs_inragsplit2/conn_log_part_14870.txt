Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are more than 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 18.101.165.68 within a very short time frame. This indicates a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests flooding the target, consistent with a ping flood attack. The source IPs are varied within the 133.247.x.x subnet, suggesting a distributed or spoofed source pattern typical of such attacks.

Since no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 20**, which relates to suspicious ICMP flood behavior. The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**, as ping floods aim to overwhelm the targetâ€™s network stack.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.19.40 through 133.247.184.169 (at least 16 unique sources)
- Destination IP: 18.101.165.68
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request)

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 18.101.165.68 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking sources if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers or network administrators of the source subnet to investigate potential compromise or abuse.
