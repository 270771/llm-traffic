Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8 and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, one entry has ICMP type 8 as the source port (43.140.41.131 â†’ 163.252.179.93 with src port 8 is actually ICMP type 8), but the other entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) as the source port, which is not a ping flood indicator.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood, and no anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
