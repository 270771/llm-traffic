Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 3.231.100.178, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.231.100.178.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to filter or block traffic from the identified source IP ranges if possible.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
