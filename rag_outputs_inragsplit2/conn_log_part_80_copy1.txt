Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.21.172.29, 163.21.33.53, 203.65.118.232, etc.). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or devices behind 163.76.120.97 that may be launching the attack.
- Monitor for any signs of collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS to catch similar future events.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the source host for compromise or misconfiguration.
