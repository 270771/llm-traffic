Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time frame.
- All entries have ICMP type 8, which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one destination IP strongly match the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches a classic ICMP flood (heuristic 20 is commonly associated with volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).

Recommended Security Response Plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the destination host (52.236.221.123) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
- Engage network operations to trace and potentially block or filter traffic upstream to mitigate the flood.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services if not already in place.
- Review and update incident response playbooks to handle volumetric ICMP attacks.
