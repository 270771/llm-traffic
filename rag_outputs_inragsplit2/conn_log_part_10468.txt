Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 2 and 18, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (2 = Echo Reply, 18 = Address Mask Request) do not match typical flood or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if additional logs show a surge in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Monitor for any heuristic 20 matches or other anomaly indicators once anomaly data is available.  
- Continue to collect and analyze more comprehensive network traffic data for potential threats.
