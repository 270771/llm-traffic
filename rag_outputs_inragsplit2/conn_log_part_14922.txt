Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present.
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any new anomalies or heuristic matches appear in subsequent logs.
