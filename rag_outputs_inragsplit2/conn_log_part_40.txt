Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating primarily from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs, satisfying the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of excessive ICMP Echo Requests flooding the network.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the primary attacker; destination IPs include 23.248.101.250, 104.92.228.5, 2.210.3.248, 23.213.91.2, 23.253.147.255, 23.255.195.2, 23.64.1.250, 23.67.80.9, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or related anomalies from this or other IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the compromised host at 133.16.14.149 to identify infection or compromise.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attacks.
5. Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
