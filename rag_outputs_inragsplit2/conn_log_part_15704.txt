Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The log shows multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets directed at a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) from various source IPs, but there are only 9 such instances within the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomalies or heuristic matches (such as heuristic 20) are present to override this count.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The single ICMP type 3 packet (destination unreachable) and other ICMP types do not meet criteria for ping flood or other known ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests to the same destination IP to see if the count surpasses the threshold. Investigate the source IPs for any suspicious behavior or known malicious activity. If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate accordingly.
