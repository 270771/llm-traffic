Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, they show anomalies related to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (unknown/mptmp), neither of which indicate ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN floods, not ICMP ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 is specifically for ping floods, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets, absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to detect any future ICMP-based anomalies, as current logs do not capture ICMP traffic.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies not visible in Zeek conn.log.
