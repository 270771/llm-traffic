Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomalies listed (anomaly_782 and anomaly_772) are categorized under heuristic 10, which corresponds to SYN attacks, not ping floods (heuristic 20).
- The heuristic 10 classification indicates suspicious SYN traffic, consistent with TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated ICMP traffic from suspicious IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.

No evidence currently supports a ping flood attack per the provided data.
