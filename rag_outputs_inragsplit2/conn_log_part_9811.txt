Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are more than 10 distinct ICMP type 8 connection attempts targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25), consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating multiple hosts potentially participating in the flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting the same destination).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Network Denial of Service" (DoS) due to the volume and nature of ICMP echo requests.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.XX.XX range (e.g., 133.247.117.38, 133.247.95.167, 133.247.37.157, etc.)
- Destination IPs: Primarily 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25, with one instance targeting 23.23.133.3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic if internal mitigation is insufficient.
- Conduct forensic analysis on source hosts to determine if they are compromised or participating in a coordinated attack.
- Consider deploying ICMP traffic anomaly detection tools to alert on future floods.
