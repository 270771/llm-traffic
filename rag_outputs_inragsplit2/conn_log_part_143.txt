Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP entries, but none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The ICMP types present are 3, 11, and 18, which correspond to Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, and Address Mask Request respectively, not Echo Requests.  
- There is only one entry with ICMP type 8 (first line: src 18.167.146.121 to dst 203.65.103.15), but it appears only once, not the minimum 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The anomaly record references heuristic 20 (Ping flood) for traffic involving destination IP 218.243.155.95, but the conn.log entry for that IP shows ICMP type 3, not type 8, so it does not match ping flood criteria.  

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection based on ICMP Echo Requests.  
- The anomaly taxonomy "ntscICecrqICecrprp" relates to NetworkScanICMP, indicating suspicious ICMP scanning activity, not a flood.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly involving 218.243.155.95 further for possible ICMP scanning or reconnaissance activity, as indicated by heuristic 20 and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules to ensure ICMP scanning is logged and mitigated appropriately.
