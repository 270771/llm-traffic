Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.239.183.175 within a very short time frame. This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and categorizes the anomaly as 'ntscICecrqICecrprp', a variant of the NetworkScanICMP class. This confirms the detection aligns with known heuristic and taxonomy definitions for ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.110.109, 133.240.65.44, 133.240.208.112, etc.) all targeting destination IP 54.239.183.175 on ICMP type 8 (ping requests). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the destination host 54.239.183.175 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  4. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  5. Notify upstream providers or coordinate with network administrators to mitigate the attack closer to the source if possible.
