Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are suspicious.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP Echo Requests from the source IP 52.237.221.62 to multiple destinations. If the count exceeds 10 or anomalies appear in future logs, re-evaluate for ping flood. Additionally, investigate the source IPâ€™s reputation and check for any related alerts in other logs.
