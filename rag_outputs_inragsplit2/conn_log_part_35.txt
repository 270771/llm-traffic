Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting a single destination IP 52.190.120.127 from multiple source IPs within the 133.7.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.7.164.209, 133.7.164.222, 133.7.138.245, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 52.190.120.127 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Assigning heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service" based on standard attack classification for ping floods.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 52.190.120.127 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Alert incident response team to investigate potential compromise of source hosts or further lateral movement attempts.
