Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 68.104.133.69, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 counts toward ping flood detection.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and destination IP 68.104.133.69; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 68.104.133.69 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and identify if source IPs are spoofed.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests to the affected host if business operations allow.
