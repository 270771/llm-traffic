Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 128 and 8. ICMP type 128 corresponds to an ICMP Echo Reply (commonly used in IPv6), and type 8 corresponds to an ICMP Echo Request.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (ping request) in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.
- The traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood, which involves a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) targeting a host.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP or to the same destination IP.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.
- Investigate the source IP 51.121.111.183 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests at a higher rate.
