Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 14 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating primarily from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which involves overwhelming targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 128.13.52.198, 104.79.58.1, 95.100.213.227, 104.77.150.5, 104.73.137.250, 23.234.253.251, 23.178.145.252, 2.214.249.255, 23.218.169.251, 104.65.224.3, 104.98.181.252, 92.139.236.7, 69.35.216.3). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host associated with 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement.
  5. Implement network-wide ICMP traffic thresholds and anomaly detection to prevent recurrence.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
