Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.238.213.5 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the instruction referencing known anomalous IPs and ping flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in 133.228.147.0/24, 133.228.174.0/24, 133.228.220.0/24, 133.228.248.0/24, etc., all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.238.213.5. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.238.213.5.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
