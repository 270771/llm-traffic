Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows mostly TCP and UDP traffic; only one ICMP record is present (ID `CBlMi91WsbLscFjFd1`), with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection.  
- However, there is only a single instance of ICMP type 8 traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No source or destination IPs in the log match heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any known anomalous IPs related to ping flood from the anomaly CSV.  
- The anomalies listed relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10), heavy hitters (heuristic 999), and other categories, but none indicate ICMP or ping flood activity.

Other attack types:  
- The anomalies with heuristic 10 correspond to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood or scanning), as indicated by the SYN flag and port usage.  
- For example, anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012 are categorized as 'ptmp' with heuristic 10, meaning SYN attack patterns are present.  
- The taxonomy 'ptmp' stands for partial TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN flood anomalies further by correlating connection attempts from source IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74, focusing on ports 8080 and 1433.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect if a ping flood emerges later.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for SYN flood mitigation and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious IPs.

No ping flood is detected at this time.
