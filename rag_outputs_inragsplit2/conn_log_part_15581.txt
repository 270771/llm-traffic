Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack (multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target).
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.228.x.x range and the destination IP 16.160.152.89. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.160.152.89.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs sending excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS protection capabilities.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate incident response.
