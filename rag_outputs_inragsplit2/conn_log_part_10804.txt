Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- All ICMP types are 8, which matches the requirement for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.118.1, 133.247.56.193, 133.247.46.223, etc.) targeting destination 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation and consider temporarily isolating it from the network if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic closer to the source.
