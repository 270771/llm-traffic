Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of the attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify affected network administrators of the targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
