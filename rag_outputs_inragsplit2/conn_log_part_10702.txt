Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP traffic entries have type values 11 and 0, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Echo Reply" respectively, not Echo Request.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (none are found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is evident from the data, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets is recommended to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
