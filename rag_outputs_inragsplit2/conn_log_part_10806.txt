Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances without known exceptions.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.79.70, 133.247.171.162, 133.247.176.57, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP 35.183.65.24.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  3. Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in mitigating the attack at a higher network level.
  4. Harden the target host by disabling ICMP Echo Replies if not required or deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with ICMP flood detection capabilities.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to update detection heuristics and improve alerting for similar future events.
