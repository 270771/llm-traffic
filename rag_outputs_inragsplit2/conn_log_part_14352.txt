Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are from IP 13.242.241.56 to two different destinations, with just 2 instances visible in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP traffic present is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate alert is warranted. However, further monitoring of ICMP Echo Requests from 13.242.241.56 is recommended to detect any increase in volume that might indicate a developing ping flood.
