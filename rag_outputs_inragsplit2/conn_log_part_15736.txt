Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.22.191.77 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods:
  - ICMP type 8 is required (confirmed).
  - At least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 are present (confirmed).
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.75.159, 133.247.185.88, 133.247.237.186, etc.) all targeting 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.22.191.77.
- Investigate the source IPs (133.247.75.159 and others) for potential compromise or misuse.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP range if the attack persists.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled.

This traffic clearly fits the known ping flood pattern, fulfilling the heuristic criteria for detection despite the lack of explicit anomaly records.
