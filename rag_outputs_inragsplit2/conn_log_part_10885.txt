Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from 52.42.116.124 to numerous destination IPs within a very short time frame, with at least 12 instances visible. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not indicated here). Therefore, heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" are the most appropriate assignments.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Another source IP 188.41.60.56 also sends a single ICMP type 8 packet but does not meet the threshold.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP floods or related anomalies from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a forensic review of affected destination hosts for any service degradation or collateral impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS and enable alerting for similar patterns.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with the source network owner to remediate the attack origin.
