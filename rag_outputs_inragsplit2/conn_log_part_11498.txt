Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.249.88.154 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.88.154; Destination IPs include 163.252.239.210, 163.252.156.1, 163.252.58.193, 163.252.106.62, 163.252.106.54, 163.252.65.203, 163.252.65.198, 163.252.65.196, 163.252.36.62, 163.252.10.226, 163.252.10.141, 163.252.21.198, 163.252.21.156, 163.252.125.212.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.249.88.154 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and servers for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance caused by the flood.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources of similar ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS for early detection of future attacks.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if the attack persists.
