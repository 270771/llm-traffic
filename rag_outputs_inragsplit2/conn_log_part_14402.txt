Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional suspicious indicators, this traffic appears benign.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (133.247.49.34) to the destination (104.254.26.233). If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate if these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports.
