Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is logged here.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) related to a different IP (139.64.111.127) and port 445, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood detection, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic logs specifically, as conn.log primarily records TCP/UDP connections.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods.
- Review firewall or IDS logs for ICMP anomalies.

No ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is evident from the current data. The only anomaly detected relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10), which targets TCP SYN floods, not ICMP floods.
