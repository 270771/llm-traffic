Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61). This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs strongly matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 34.44.165.118 and 44.50.62.61. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but are logged as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of logs to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP ranges to remediate potential botnet involvement.
