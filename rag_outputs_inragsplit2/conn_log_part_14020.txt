Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 35.173.100.241 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.3.196, 133.247.26.197, 133.247.252.34, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 35.173.100.241 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious and not legitimate users.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
