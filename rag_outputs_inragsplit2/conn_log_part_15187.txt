Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one IP in rapid succession.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.109.38, 133.247.252.125, 133.247.111.23, etc.) are flooding destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type 8 is critical.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet and remediate accordingly.
