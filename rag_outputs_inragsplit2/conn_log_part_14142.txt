Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 directed at a single destination IP (3.231.100.178) from multiple distinct source IPs within a short time frame, indicating a coordinated flood rather than normal ping activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the victim host (3.231.100.178) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if the flood volume escalates.
  5. Alert incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
