Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 20 specifically stands for Ping flood, which is absent here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP logs (icmp.log) are available to confirm absence of ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs.
- Review TCP SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10) as some anomalies indicate SYN attacks, which may require mitigation.
