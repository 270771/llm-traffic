Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," which may be normal network behavior or a different issue but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Investigate any repeated ICMP type 3 messages if network connectivity issues are suspected.
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
