Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 52.237.221.62. ICMP type 8 (ping) is used, no ports are relevant here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 52.237.221.62.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offending IPs if attack volume escalates.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to drop or limit ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious sources.
