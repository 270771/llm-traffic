Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or volumetric attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly datasets.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic volume thresholds to catch early signs of ping floods.
