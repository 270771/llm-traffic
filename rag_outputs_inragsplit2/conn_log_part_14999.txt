Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records. Instead, anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999).  
- The anomaly taxonomy classes present are 'ptmp' (heuristic 10) indicating SYN attacks, and 'heavy_hitter' (heuristic 999), none of which correspond to ICMP or ping flood activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further, as heuristic 10 indicates potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are exhibiting unusual TCP connection attempts or failures, especially those involved in anomalies anomaly_782, anomaly_1402, and anomaly_2012.
