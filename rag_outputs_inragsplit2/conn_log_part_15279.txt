Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages, which could indicate misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
