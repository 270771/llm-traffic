Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.197, and there is only 1 instance recorded. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets indicate any network issues or traceroute activity.
