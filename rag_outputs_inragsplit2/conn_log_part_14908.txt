Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 8 and 0, but the first entryâ€™s ICMP type is 8 only in the source port field, which is unusual since ICMP type should be in the source or destination port field consistently. The second entry shows ICMP type 0 in the source port and 8 in the destination port, which does not match the requirement that ICMP type 8 must be present in at least 10 instances from the same source or destination IP to indicate a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The ICMP types present (0 and 8) do not form a pattern consistent with a ping flood, which requires multiple ICMP echo requests (type 8) flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the behavior of IPs 139.179.133.57 and 133.247.49.34 if they continue to send ICMP traffic, to rule out reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
