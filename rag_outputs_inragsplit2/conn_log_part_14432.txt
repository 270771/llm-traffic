Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the conn.log entries show ICMP traffic with no indication that the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).  
- Only two ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The connection states are "OTH" (other), indicating incomplete or unusual connection states, but this alone does not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if ICMP type fields can be extracted or logged in more detail to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Enable anomaly detection rules or heuristics that track ICMP echo request floods for more accurate detection.
