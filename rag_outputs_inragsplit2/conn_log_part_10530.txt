Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.186.100.117) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession targeting a single host.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.106.104, 133.247.110.204, 133.247.44.37, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.186.100.117 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.186.100.117.
- Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to trace and mitigate the source of the flood.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
