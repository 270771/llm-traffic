Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `153.156.84.171` to `3.119.78.134`, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 1 or 3, which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 1 and 3 packets may be normal network error or control traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or match known heuristics once available.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service activity.
