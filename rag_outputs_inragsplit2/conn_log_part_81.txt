Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a short time frame. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, categorized as 'icmp_error', which directly corresponds to ping flood detection.
- The heuristic 20 stands for "Ping flood" and the taxonomy class "icmp_error" falls under the "Other" category, consistent with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; multiple destination IPs including 104.112.204.253, 23.246.143.5, 104.75.128.246, 104.117.213.250, 23.251.26.4, 5.78.209.94, 2.210.143.4, 23.246.40.5, 23.245.4.0, 23.247.53.255, 23.231.228.246, 184.206.188.4. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this IP or related subnets.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to identify compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
  5. Implement ICMP rate limiting globally if not already in place to mitigate future ping flood attempts.
