Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (50.239.214.145) from multiple source IPs in a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 133.228.*.* IPs and 52.230.228.52 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 50.239.214.145. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target IP (50.239.214.145) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as network-based anomaly detection or scrubbing services.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise of source hosts.
- If possible, apply geo-IP or ASN-based filtering to block suspicious source IP ranges temporarily until the attack subsides.
