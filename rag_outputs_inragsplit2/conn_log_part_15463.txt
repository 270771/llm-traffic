Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) from the same source to destination, nor any anomaly records indicating suspicious IPs or heuristic matches.

Since ICMP type 3 is a standard error message and no anomalies or heuristics are provided, this traffic does not indicate a ping flood or any other attack pattern. No further investigation is required based on this data.
