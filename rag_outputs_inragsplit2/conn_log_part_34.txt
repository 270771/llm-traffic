Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) within a very short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all entries, confirming these are ping requests.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied (e.g., 133.7.14.6, 133.7.39.252, 133.7.90.6, etc.), indicating a distributed source pattern typical of a flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting one destination) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the destination IP 52.190.120.127 is clearly the target.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.190.120.127.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers to mitigate distributed sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify the owner of 52.190.120.127 to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate incident response.
