Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 0, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance of ICMP type 8 would be relevant, but none are present here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 0 (Echo Reply), and 1 (Timestamp) suggest normal or error-related ICMP traffic rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating unusual ICMP error messages (type 3) that could indicate misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
