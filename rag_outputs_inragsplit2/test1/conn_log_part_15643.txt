Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets or network resources.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which typically corresponds to heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on routers and switches to prevent network degradation.
- Document the incident and update detection rules to alert on similar patterns in the future.
