Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.007 to 0.008 seconds per packet). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests is sent rapidly to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets in a short interval from the same source IP. This matches heuristic 20 in common taxonomy frameworks, which flags volumetric ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IP: 16.172.102.121
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.252.12.24, 163.252.234.170, 163.252.253.193, 163.252.240.76, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacker IP if it persists and impacts network availability.
