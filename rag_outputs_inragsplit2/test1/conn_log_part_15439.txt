Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP 54.184.243.206 in a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- The volume and concentration of these echo requests strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 54.184.243.206; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 targeting 54.184.243.206.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume escalates.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact and to investigate if the destination host is critical infrastructure.
