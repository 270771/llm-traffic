Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present; no such data or anomalies are found.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternate attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Requests.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture potential ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for other types of anomalies or suspicious traffic patterns, especially if heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available.
