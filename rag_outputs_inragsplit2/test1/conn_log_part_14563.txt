Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.9.51.14) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a distributed ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on internal or external hosts targeted by these ICMP requests.
3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify affected parties if internal hosts are impacted and consider blackholing traffic if attack volume escalates.
