Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and some RSTR responses, indicating scanning or connection attempts but not ICMP flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The TCP SYN attempts could be part of scanning activity, but without further anomaly context or heuristic matches, this is not conclusive.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging and alerts.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from single sources or towards single destinations.
- Correlate with anomaly detection systems for heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once available.
