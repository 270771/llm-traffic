Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 54.186.116.19 to destination 163.252.255.83, and there is only 1 instance recorded. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IP 54.186.116.19 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
