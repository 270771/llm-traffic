Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.158.38.252) from multiple source IPs within the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.161.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service" as the most likely labels based on standard ping flood characteristics.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.161.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host (18.158.38.252) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or spoofed IPs.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
- Alert incident response team to investigate potential botnet involvement and prepare for mitigation escalation.
