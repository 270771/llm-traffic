Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal network control messages rather than attack indicators.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect and analyze more comprehensive logs with heuristic context to identify other anomalies.  
- Investigate if the involved IPs (163.252.147.24, 123.122.91.137, 133.228.62.234, 138.201.25.219) show any other suspicious activity in other logs.
