Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward a single destination IP 161.67.57.135, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack (multiple ICMP Echo Requests targeting one host).
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the destination host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
