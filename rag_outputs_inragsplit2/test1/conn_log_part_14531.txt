Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.48 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.81.162, 133.247.81.90, 133.247.109.57, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.47.68.48 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 69.47.68.48 for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from suspicious or unexpected regions.
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and update firewall rules accordingly.
