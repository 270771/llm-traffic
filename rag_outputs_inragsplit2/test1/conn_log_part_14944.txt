Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 3, respectively, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other types of attacks. The ICMP types seen (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) may indicate network issues or scanning but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs (133.228.62.234 and 202.124.53.30) for unusual activity or repeated ICMP error messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that could indicate emerging ping flood attempts.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to better classify future anomalies.
