Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records or heuristic context requires assigning a default heuristic and taxonomy: this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range flooding the destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the victim host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Investigate upstream network devices for possible source spoofing or compromised hosts.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to detect recurrence.
