Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from one source.
- The involved IP address is 163.171.168.73 (source) targeting multiple destination IPs such as 163.252.239.237, 163.252.215.218, 163.252.93.40, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
  3. Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misconfiguration.
  4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic volume impacts external connectivity.
