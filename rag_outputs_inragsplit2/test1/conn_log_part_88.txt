Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the 11th field (value after the protocol field "icmp"). Here, the values are mostly missing or indicated as "-", and the 4th field (which might be ICMP type in some Zeek logs) shows values like 3 and 11, which correspond to ICMP types "Destination Unreachable" (3) and "Time Exceeded" (11), not type 8 (Echo Request).
- No entries show ICMP type 8, which is required to identify ping flood attacks.
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances is zero, well below the threshold of 10.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest exceptions or known anomalous IPs that would override this rule.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomaly data is present, no attack is currently evident.

Next steps:
- Investigate the nature of the ICMP type 3 and 11 traffic, as these can indicate network issues or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns.
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate accordingly.
