Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping flood attacks, but no ICMP traffic is logged here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic mostly consists of TCP SYN attempts and UDP flows, which do not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The observed traffic appears to be normal connection attempts or scanning activity, but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Requests.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture potential ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to confirm any ping flood activity.
