Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.22.151.10) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.74.146, 133.247.176.57, 133.247.65.158, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.22.151.10 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (18.22.151.10) for service degradation or outages and consider isolating it if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources to assist in mitigation.
- Enable logging and alerting for further ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services.
