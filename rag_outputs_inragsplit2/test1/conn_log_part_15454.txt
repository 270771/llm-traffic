Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.161.126.169 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a single target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple sources from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.164.67, 157.17.250.88, 157.17.45.255, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 16.161.126.169 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage network firewall or intrusion prevention systems to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Conduct further investigation to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts within the network.
- Consider blacklisting persistent offenders and alerting network operations for potential mitigation or remediation actions.
