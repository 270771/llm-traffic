Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.134.27) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination").
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host (34.25.134.27) for performance degradation or service impact.
  3. Investigate upstream network devices for possible source spoofing or compromised hosts.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS protection services.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader attack vectors.
