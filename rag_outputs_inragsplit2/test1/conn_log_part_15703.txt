Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two connections from different source IPs (133.228.147.254 and 133.228.237.48) to the same destination (52.236.221.123). However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (type 3, 1, 11, 0) are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a victim.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the same destination IP.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect if any source IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests if they are unexpected or unknown in the environment.
