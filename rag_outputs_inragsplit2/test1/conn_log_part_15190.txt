Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, originating from multiple different source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding a threshold (here >10), which is clearly met.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the volume and nature of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.23.231, 133.247.167.25, 133.247.240.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 54.229.78.71 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS mitigation appliances.
