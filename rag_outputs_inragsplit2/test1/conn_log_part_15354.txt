Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from source IP 13.75.4.206 to various destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are at least 5 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 from the same source IP within a very short time frame, indicating repeated echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the rapid succession and concentration from a single source IP strongly suggest a ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly CSV or heuristic context is provided, but based on standard ping flood detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.75.4.206 targeting destination IPs 133.251.203.166, 133.251.210.62, 133.251.201.197, 133.251.201.158, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.75.4.206 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and other IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential DoS escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
