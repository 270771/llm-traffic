Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 0 or missing type information; none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances is zero, well below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic or anomaly data present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include:  
- Verifying ICMP type fields in more complete logs to confirm absence of Echo Requests.  
- Monitoring for other ICMP types or traffic patterns that might indicate different reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Collecting anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
