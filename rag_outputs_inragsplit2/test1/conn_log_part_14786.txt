Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No attack is present here. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration messages, not flooding. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate security response is warranted. If further investigation is desired, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP over a short time window would be the next step.
