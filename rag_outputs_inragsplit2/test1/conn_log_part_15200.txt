Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs per heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeek conn.log may not log ICMP by default or may require icmp.log analysis.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for other suspicious patterns in TCP/UDP traffic, such as SYN floods or DNS amplification, given the presence of many failed TCP connection attempts (S0 states).
