Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 133.16.14.149 targeting multiple destination IPs, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Additionally, another source IP 35.73.84.120 is also sending multiple ICMP type 8 packets to various destinations in rapid succession.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Sources: 133.16.14.149, 35.73.84.120
  - Destinations: Multiple, including 23.77.42.252, 95.101.133.228, 104.65.252.0, 23.248.69.250, 23.249.200.3, 23.216.136.5, 104.112.114.0, 173.50.207.4, 23.64.12.0, 92.139.184.4, 23.95.43.7, 163.210.183.6, 163.210.17.249, 163.210.232.15, 163.210.231.251, 163.210.36.249, 163.210.170.22, 163.210.13.58
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (133.16.14.149 and 35.73.84.120).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or follow-up attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are external and not part of legitimate network operations.
