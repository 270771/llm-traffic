Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All provided conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic shows multiple failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP echo requests or relevant anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the repeated TCP connection failures (S0) for possible port scanning or brute force attempts.
- Apply heuristic 1 (if defined) for TCP scanning detection and taxonomy class "Reconnaissance" if applicable.
- Monitor for any future ICMP traffic spikes or anomalies to detect potential ping floods.
