Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 20 commonly relates to volumetric ICMP floods in many taxonomies).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Additionally, verify the destination hostâ€™s availability and performance impact, and prepare to escalate to upstream providers if attack volume increases.
