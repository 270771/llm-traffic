Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic present has types 3 and 1, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 1 (Host Unreachable) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
