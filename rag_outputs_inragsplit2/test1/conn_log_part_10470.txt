Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the destination port field being 0 and no explicit ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) present. Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the ping flood criteria. Additionally, only one instance is logged, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP errors.
