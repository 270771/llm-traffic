Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), so the traffic is ICMP ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to determine if a pattern of flooding emerges.
