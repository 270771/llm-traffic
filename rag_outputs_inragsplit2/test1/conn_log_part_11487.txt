Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.83.92.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x and 202.202.x.x ranges; destination IP is 3.83.92.175; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is consistent across all.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests destined for 3.83.92.175.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs sending excessive ICMP traffic.
- Monitor network and host performance on 3.83.92.175 for signs of degradation or service impact.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader DDoS activity.
