Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from two source IPs: 35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests from the same sources to many destinations strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to ICMP flood detection based on volume and type.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"Network Denial of Service" (DoS)** due to the nature of the flooding attack aiming to disrupt network availability.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IPs: 35.183.65.24, 34.25.134.27
  - Destination IPs: Multiple in 163.252.0.0/16 range
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services, such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing, if the attack volume increases.
- Review and update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns proactively.
