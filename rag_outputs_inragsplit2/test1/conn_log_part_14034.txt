Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 10. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 133.247.173.120 to 35.173.100.241). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The single ICMP Echo Request could be normal network behavior or a benign ping.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or volume spikes.  
- Investigate if the source IP 133.247.173.120 or destination IP 35.173.100.241 have any prior history of suspicious activity.
