Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.42.116.124 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; Destination IPs include 163.252.16.25, 163.252.3.130, 163.252.146.22, 163.252.183.114, 163.252.201.36, and others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP anomaly detection.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
