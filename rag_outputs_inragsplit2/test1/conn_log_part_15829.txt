Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IPs (primarily 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context requires assigning a default heuristic and taxonomy: this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection by volume and type) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
