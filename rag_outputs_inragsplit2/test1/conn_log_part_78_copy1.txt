Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (as per your instructions) related to known anomalous source IPs performing ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.76.120.97; multiple destination IPs in the 163.21.x.x and other ranges.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation or denial.
