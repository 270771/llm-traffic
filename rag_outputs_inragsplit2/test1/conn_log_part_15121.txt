Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 10, and 8. Only the entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 10 messages may be normal network behavior or related to routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 161.139.187.128 sending the single ICMP echo request if it recurs frequently.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
