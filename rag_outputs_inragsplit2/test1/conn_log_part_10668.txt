Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total 8 instances targeting 44.50.62.61, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No ICMP type other than 8 is involved in these entries, so no other ICMP-based attack is indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports (heuristic 20 or others) that would lower the threshold or indicate an attack.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) entry is a single instance and does not match flood patterns.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic volume to the destination IP 44.50.62.61 for any increase beyond the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests if their behavior escalates or if other anomalies appear.  
- Collect and correlate additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
