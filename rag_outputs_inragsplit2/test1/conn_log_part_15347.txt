Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are over 20 distinct source IP addresses all sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (18.34.27.210) within a very short time frame. This high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one host is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is best categorized as **"Denial of Service (DoS)"** due to the nature of overwhelming the target with ICMP Echo Requests.

Involved IP addresses:
- Destination IP: 18.34.27.210 (target)
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.163.1, 157.17.96.241, 157.17.221.217, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.34.27.210.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to full DoS mitigation services.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are participating in the attack and remediate accordingly.
