Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only one ICMP type 8 (echo request) instance is present in the snippet (second entry). The other ICMP entries are type 3 and 128/129, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first ICMP type 3 is a destination unreachable message, and the third entry with types 128/129 corresponds to ICMPv6 echo request/reply, but only one such instance is present.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly records or match known heuristics once available.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
