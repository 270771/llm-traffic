Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard definition, this volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination strongly indicates a ping flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.197.36, 157.17.19.193, 157.17.70.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP addresses temporarily.
- Monitor the destination host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or outages.
- Investigate upstream network devices and ISP for possible source spoofing or amplification.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests matching this pattern.
- Alert the incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up attacks.
