Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 52.158.11.176 to destination 163.252.70.57, and there is only one such instance in the snippet.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 message could be normal network behavior or a separate issue but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or other issues.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
