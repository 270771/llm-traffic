Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 157.17.105.97 to destination 139.174.78.33, with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 157.17.105.97 or destination 139.174.78.33 appear in future anomaly reports or show unusual traffic patterns.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
