Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not explicitly stated but given the count is 1, it does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or other heuristics.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly data, this traffic does not match ping flood or other volumetric ICMP attack patterns.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. Collect more connection logs to identify potential patterns or spikes in ICMP traffic. If multiple ICMP echo requests accumulate rapidly, re-evaluate for ping flood using the heuristic of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
