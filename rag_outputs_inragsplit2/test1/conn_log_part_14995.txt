Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8, but only two instances are present in the snippet, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests (type 8) from a single source to a destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Collect and analyze a larger volume of ICMP traffic over time to detect potential flooding patterns.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged by heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume or suspicious IP addresses.
