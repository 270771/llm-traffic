Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 0 and 8, but the first entry shows ICMP type 8 as the destination port, which is unusual and likely a parsing artifact; the second entry has ICMP type 8 as the source port, which is also inconsistent.
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.
- The traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP echo requests (type 8) flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious behavior in other logs.
