Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.244.0, 133.247.244.48, 133.247.144.194, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host (52.230.228.52) for performance degradation and potential service impact.
3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
5. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and remediate potentially compromised hosts within the 133.247.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
