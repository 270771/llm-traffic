Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Further investigation would require more data showing multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 to consider a ping flood or related ICMP attack.
