Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.158.38.252) from multiple source IPs within the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.161.29.213, 157.161.45.89, 157.161.29.223, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.158.38.252 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (18.158.38.252) for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts in a botnet.
