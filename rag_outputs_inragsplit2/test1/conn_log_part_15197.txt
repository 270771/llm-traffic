Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 8 and 0, but the first record shows ICMP type 8 as the source port and 0 as the destination port, and the second record reverses this.  
- There are only 2 ICMP type 8 instances total, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source flooding a destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the involved IPs (213.83.94.179 and 133.247.49.34) for any other suspicious activity in other logs.
