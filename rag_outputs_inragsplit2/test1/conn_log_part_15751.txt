Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, which are normal in traceroute or routing scenarios, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
