Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the snippet shows values 11 and 8. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the log snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.
- Investigate the source IPs 139.179.133.57 and 58.193.7.115 for unusual activity if the volume increases.
