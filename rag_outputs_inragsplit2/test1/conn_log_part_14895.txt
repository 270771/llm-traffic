Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.102, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods and may indicate normal network error messages.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic exceeding the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in high volume.  
- Check for other types of ICMP anomalies or network errors indicated by type 3 messages.

No current heuristic or taxonomy classification applies due to lack of anomaly data.
