Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.116.11.97, consistent with a ping flood pattern where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types are 8 except one entry which is type 0 (Echo Reply), which does not negate the flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are referenced. By default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one from 139.179.133.57, all targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 3.116.11.97.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting persistent offending source IPs.
- Engage incident response to verify if the target host is impacted and prepare mitigation such as traffic shaping or upstream filtering with the ISP.
- Enable logging and alerting on ICMP traffic spikes to detect recurrence early.
