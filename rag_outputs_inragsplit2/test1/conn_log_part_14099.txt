Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present, but there are only 11 instances targeting a single destination IP (54.166.249.180) from different source IPs, which is borderline but does not clearly indicate a flood by itself.  
- The other ICMP types present (1 and 3) are not relevant to ping floods.  
- There is no anomaly data or heuristic context provided to confirm suspicious behavior or known malicious IPs.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is met, but these appear as isolated connection log entries rather than a sustained flood; no volume or rate data is given to confirm flooding.  
- No known heuristic 20 or other heuristics are referenced, and no anomaly taxonomy is available.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to 54.166.249.180 for unusual volume or frequency over time.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP traffic rate or repeated ICMP Echo Requests that could indicate a slow or distributed ping flood.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics or alerts for denial-of-service symptoms.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data.
