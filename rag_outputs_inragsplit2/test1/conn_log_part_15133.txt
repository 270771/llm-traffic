Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances (in fact, none), and no anomalous IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 are indicated.
- No anomaly records are found in the anomaly CSV to suggest suspicious ICMP activity.
- Without ICMP traffic, this cannot be classified as a ping flood or any ICMP-based attack.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, using tools like Zeekâ€™s icmp.log or packet captures.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to suspicious IPs.
- Review heuristics related to ICMP flood detection once heuristic context is available.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current TCP connection logs.
