Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 10 corresponds to Router Advertisement, both normal ICMP control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from any source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors that could indicate other network issues or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
