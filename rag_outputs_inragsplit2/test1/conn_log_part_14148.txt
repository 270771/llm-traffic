Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 161.67.42.226 targeting multiple destination IPs (203.78.170.52, 203.78.186.53, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.174.82, 203.78.173.222, 203.78.184.33, 203.78.178.94, 203.78.179.89, 203.78.174.116), indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- Other ICMP traffic with type 8 is present but less frequent and from different sources, reinforcing that the main suspicious activity is from 161.67.42.226.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and taxonomy class "Ping Flood" based on the criteria given.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but source IP 161.67.42.226 and multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range are involved.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 161.67.42.226 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct further investigation on the source IP 161.67.42.226 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to prevent recurrence.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate mitigation.
