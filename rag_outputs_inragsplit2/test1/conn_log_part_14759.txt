Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  
- The connection states are OTH (other), and no repeated or sustained traffic pattern is evident from the snippet.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they appear repeatedly or in other suspicious contexts.
