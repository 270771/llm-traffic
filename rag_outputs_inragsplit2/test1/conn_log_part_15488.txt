Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with ICMP type 8: from 24.74.82.81 to 203.78.187.167 and from 157.17.104.217 to 8.247.227.244). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11) are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if network connectivity issues are reported.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
