Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type that is not explicitly stated as type 8 (echo request), and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or corroborating anomaly data, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs, and collect more connection logs to identify any emerging patterns. If multiple ICMP echo requests appear, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics once available.
