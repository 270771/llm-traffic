Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, the ICMP type 3 message could indicate network issues or scanning activity; monitoring for repeated ICMP errors or unusual traffic patterns from these IPs (203.78.182.18 and 80.142.66.223) is recommended.
