Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (129.43.174.6) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 202.252.225.x subnet. This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many hosts is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.174.6; Destination IPs range from 202.252.225.42 through 202.252.225.63.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 129.43.174.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 129.43.174.6 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact on the targeted subnet.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
