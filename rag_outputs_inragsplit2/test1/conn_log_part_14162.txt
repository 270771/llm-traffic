Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.220.233.141) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic, which typically corresponds to heuristic number 20 (as per your instructions) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IP: 54.220.233.141 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.252.38.248, 163.252.187.35, 163.252.151.211, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
5. Implement or review existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
