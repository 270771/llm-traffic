Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total only 6 distinct instances targeting 3.20.63.105 and 35.76.83.101, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 3, type 0, type 10) do not correspond to Echo Requests and thus are not relevant to ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination typical of ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network operations.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets exceeding 10 instances from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated failed connection attempts.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
