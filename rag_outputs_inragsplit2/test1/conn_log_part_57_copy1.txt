Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (timestamps 1641790947.917786 and 1641790950.976327). Both are from different source IPs (54.243.10.156 and 18.167.118.9) targeting 203.65.103.15.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is only 2, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The majority of other ICMP traffic is type 11 (Time Exceeded) or other types, which do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 packets may warrant investigation for possible traceroute or network path issues but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual network behavior is observed.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
