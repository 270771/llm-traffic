Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. A ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not available here. No anomalies or heuristics are indicated in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided.

No other attack type is evident from this single ICMP Time Exceeded packet. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
