Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from the source IP 163.171.168.73 to two different destination IPs (202.194.36.1 and 202.194.37.57). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The low volume of ICMP Echo Requests and absence of anomalies suggest normal or benign ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- If heuristic or anomaly data becomes available, correlate to reassess risk.
