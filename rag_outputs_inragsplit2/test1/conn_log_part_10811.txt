Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from various sources targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 35.183.65.24.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved (133.247.172.64, 133.247.244.54, 133.247.94.118, etc.).
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact on the targeted host.
