Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.22.191.77 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting one host) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (133.247.238.238, 133.247.107.193, 133.247.54.154, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 3.22.191.77.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 3.22.191.77 and prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP range if it is not part of trusted networks.
