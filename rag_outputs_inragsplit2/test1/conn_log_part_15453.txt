Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range flooding the destination IP 16.161.126.169. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Implement source-based filtering or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be suspicious or irrelevant.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify network operations to investigate the targeted host for service impact and consider deploying anti-DDoS mitigation services if attack volume escalates.
