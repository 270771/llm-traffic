Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.79.249 to multiple destination IPs (133.141.197.32 through 133.141.197.49), all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). This matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to many targets.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.79.249; Destination IPs 133.141.197.32 - 133.141.197.49; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.79.249 at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source.
  3. Investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential DoS impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
