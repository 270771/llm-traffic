Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet observed is from IP 16.173.78.65 to 203.65.103.15, and there is only one such instance.
- Other ICMP entries have type values other than 8 or are zero, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no heuristic context or anomaly data provided).
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.
- Investigate the source IP 16.173.78.65 for unusual ICMP activity if it persists or increases.
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify other possible attack vectors.
