Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ICMP flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many detection frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
