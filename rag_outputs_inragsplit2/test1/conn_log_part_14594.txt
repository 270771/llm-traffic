Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 messages could be normal network error responses.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors from the same IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs (130.197.174.33) and destination IPs (139.64.187.142, 159.0.89.248) for any unusual behavior or patterns in other logs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
