Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.90), which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to suggest such a condition.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods and may indicate normal network diagnostics or traceroute activity.

No anomalies or heuristics are found in the provided data to suggest any other attack type. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or checking for other suspicious traffic patterns, but currently, no attack is detected.
