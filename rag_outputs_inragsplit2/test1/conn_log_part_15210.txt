Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.
- The ICMP types 11 and 3 correspond to Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal control messages and not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking other logs for repeated ICMP Echo Requests to confirm absence of ping floods.
