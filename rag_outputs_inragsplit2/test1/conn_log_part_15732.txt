Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 95.182.58.120 to 202.194.9.13, and there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP packet is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same or other sources.  
- Investigate if 95.182.58.120 or 202.194.9.13 have appeared in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
