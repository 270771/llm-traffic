Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from the single source IP 16.172.102.121 targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the network or hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; Destination IPs include 163.252.67.118, 163.252.136.0, 163.252.82.193, 163.252.136.83, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch future occurrences early.
- Consider deploying ICMP traffic shaping or filtering policies to mitigate similar volumetric attacks.
