Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All provided Zeek conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records appear in the snippet.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect ping floods.
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to correlate suspicious IPs or patterns.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP exceeding the threshold of 10 instances.
