Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.208.10.201 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099673.25-1641099673.26). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets to many targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood: ICMP type 8 with at least 10 instances from the same source IP.
- The involved IP address is 13.208.10.201 as the attacker/source, sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 13.208.10.201 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source and related IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 13.208.10.201 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Notify network operations to check for service impact on targeted IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
