Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs, notably 52.42.116.124 and 54.212.29.159, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 52.42.116.124 and 54.212.29.159. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting persistent offending source IPs at firewall or router level.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in the attack as part of a botnet.
