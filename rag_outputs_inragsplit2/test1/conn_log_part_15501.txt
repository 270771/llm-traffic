Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 0, 8, and 0. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is observed, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (0) correspond to echo replies, not echo requests, and do not indicate flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned confidently.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IP 130.197.147.183 for any unusual activity if further data becomes available.
