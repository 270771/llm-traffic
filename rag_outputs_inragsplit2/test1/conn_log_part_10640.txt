Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 54.237.185.15 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP from multiple sources, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 54.237.185.15; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.237.185.15.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.
  5. Investigate if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet to remediate at the source.
