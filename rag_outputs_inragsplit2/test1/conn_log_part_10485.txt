Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.228.194, 163.252.101.198, 163.252.182.249, 163.252.27.249, 163.252.46.99, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs if the attack volume is large and persistent to coordinate broader mitigation.
