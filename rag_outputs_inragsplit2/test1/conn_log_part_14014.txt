Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.25.86.31) from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Since all ICMP types are 8, it confirms these are ping requests, not other ICMP message types.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source IP 133.247.181.240, all targeting destination IP 34.25.86.31 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests to 34.25.86.31 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Deploy network-level filtering to drop ICMP packets from suspicious source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16 and 133.247.181.240).
3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate attack sources.
4. Consider enabling ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
5. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential service degradation or outage.

This is a clear, ongoing ICMP ping flood attack requiring immediate mitigation.
