Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears multiple times targeting the IP 54.186.100.117, with at least 10 instances present (counting entries with ICMP type 8).  
- However, the anomaly CSV contains no records indicating suspicious IPs or ports, and no heuristic context is provided to confirm known attack patterns or heuristics.  
- Without known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 or other heuristics, the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets would suggest a ping flood. But the timestamps and counts here show isolated connection log entries rather than a sustained flood. The entries are spaced and do not indicate a high packet rate or volume typical of a ping flood.  
- Additionally, no other ICMP types or unusual flags are present to suggest a different attack type.

Next steps:  
- Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets to 54.186.100.117 over a longer period to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs (e.g., 133.247.130.24, 133.247.136.229, 133.247.130.147, etc.) for any unusual behavior or reputation issues.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic thresholds to catch any emerging ping flood attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned at this time.
