Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.231.100.178 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), characterized by high-frequency ICMP Echo Requests from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.231.100.178; Destination IPs include 163.252.83.24, 163.252.145.254, 163.252.28.62, 163.252.10.201, 163.252.28.19, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 3.231.100.178 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or targeted by the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP rate-limiting policies to prevent similar volumetric attacks.
- Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP flood attacks efficiently.
