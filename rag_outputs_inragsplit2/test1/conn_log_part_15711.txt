Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 8 instances are observed targeting the IP 52.236.221.123, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP traffic entries have types different from 8 or are isolated single instances, not matching flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to or from the same IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unknown or unexpected in the network environment.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify any emerging patterns.
