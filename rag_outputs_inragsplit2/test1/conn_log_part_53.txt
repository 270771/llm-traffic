Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.16.14.149 to numerous destination IPs, totaling well over 10 instances, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so port 0 is standard here).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or others.
  3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and consider blackholing traffic if the attack persists.
  5. Review and update ICMP handling policies to prevent similar flooding attacks.
