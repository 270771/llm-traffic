Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destinations appear repeatedly, but the total count of ICMP type 8 instances is fewer than 10 in this snippet. Also, no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV. Other ICMP types (1, 3, 13) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, the absence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets above the threshold and no flagged anomalies strongly suggests no ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any single source IP, especially if it exceeds 10 instances rapidly. Investigate any future anomalies flagged with heuristic 20 or related taxonomy classes for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
