Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.164.66, 157.17.107.31, 157.17.206.3, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 161.67.57.135.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
