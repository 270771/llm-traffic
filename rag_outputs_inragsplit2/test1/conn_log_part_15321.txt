Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but only in small counts per source IP, with no single source generating at least 10 instances. The total number of ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10 per source, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override this threshold. Other ICMP types (3) are also present but do not indicate ping flood.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets may indicate normal ping activity or low-volume scanning rather than flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packet volume from any single source IP. Investigate sources with repeated ICMP traffic if volume rises above threshold or if other suspicious behaviors emerge.
