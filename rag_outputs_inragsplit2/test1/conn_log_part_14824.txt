Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 34.37.79.118. This matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, but by default, heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service" apply here given the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.24.25, 133.247.50.85, 133.247.255.45) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.37.79.118 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts in the 133.247.x.x subnet acting as sources.
