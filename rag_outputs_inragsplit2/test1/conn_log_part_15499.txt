Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture relevant packets.  
- Monitor for other TCP/UDP anomalies since the current logs show many SYN attempts with no completions (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or reconnaissance but not a ping flood.  
- If scanning is suspected, apply heuristics related to port scanning or SYN flood detection for further analysis.
