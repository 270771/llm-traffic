Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0 or 1 or 11 (the 4th and 6th fields after the timestamp are 11, 3, or 11, which correspond to ICMP types other than 8). None of the entries show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only single instances of each ICMP connection, with no repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present and no anomalies are detected, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns. No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any future logs showing repeated ICMP type 8 packets or known suspicious IPs per heuristic 20 if available.
