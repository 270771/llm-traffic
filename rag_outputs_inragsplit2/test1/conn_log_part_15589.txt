Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.228.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 192.179.223.212, 192.179.223.214) are flooding the destination IP 16.160.152.89 with ICMP Echo Requests on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so this is standard).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the affected host 16.160.152.89 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of ICMP floods.
- Engage with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if the attack volume escalates.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools that can dynamically respond to such volumetric attacks.
