Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.238.213.5 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.140.121, 133.228.208.10, 133.228.217.204, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.238.213.5.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other network logs to detect possible coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation escalation such as blackholing or upstream filtering if the attack persists.
