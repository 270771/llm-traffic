Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance appears once in the snippet (from 133.247.49.34 to 193.20.135.157).  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant for ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.49.34 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests at a higher rate.
