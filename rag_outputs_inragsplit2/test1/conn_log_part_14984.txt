Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). Only the entry with ICMP type 8 is relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 52.188.63.191 to 133.251.65.170), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packet is a normal network diagnostic message (Time Exceeded), not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Investigate if the source IP 52.188.63.191 or destination IP 133.251.65.170 have any prior history of suspicious activity.
