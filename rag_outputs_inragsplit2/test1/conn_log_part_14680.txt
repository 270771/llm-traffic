Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0 and 11, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is the basis for ping flood detection.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets if they persist or increase, as they may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
