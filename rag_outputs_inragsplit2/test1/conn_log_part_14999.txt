Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none, so the threshold for ping flood detection is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN packets and some REJ responses, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the TCP SYN attempts further for possible port scanning or reconnaissance activity.
- Apply heuristic 20 if available to detect suspicious IPs involved in scanning.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
