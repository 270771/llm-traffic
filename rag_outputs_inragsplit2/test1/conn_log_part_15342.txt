Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is the last one, with 13 instances from source IP 157.17.205.95 to destination 159.158.28.214. This meets the minimum count of 10 for potential ping flood detection.  
- However, the other ICMP entries have types 1 and 3, which are not echo requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- There is no anomaly data or heuristic context provided to confirm suspicious behavior or known malicious IPs.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a sustained or distributed flood from multiple sources or to multiple destinations, which is typical in ping flood attacks.  
- The connection state is OTH (other), indicating no established session, which is common for ICMP but does not alone indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor the source IP 157.17.205.95 for repeated or increasing ICMP echo requests.  
- Collect more data over time to detect if the volume or distribution of ICMP echo requests increases, which could indicate an emerging ping flood.  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for any known malicious activity using external threat intelligence.
