Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 7 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified in the logs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be multiple hosts sending ICMP echo requests to a single destination, which could be normal network scanning or monitoring activity.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs for any unusual behavior or reputation issues. Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests to confirm if a ping flood develops. Collect more data to apply heuristics and taxonomy once available.
