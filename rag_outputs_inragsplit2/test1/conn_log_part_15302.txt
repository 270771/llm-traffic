Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 4th field after IPs is the ICMP type), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero; thus, the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, which are normal in some network conditions and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or repeated ICMP type 11 messages if network latency or routing issues are suspected.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
