Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed or spoofed source pattern typical of ping flood attacks.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP Echo Request flood (heuristic 1: ICMP flood; taxonomy class: Denial of Service).
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack type.
- Specific security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor and filter inbound ICMP traffic to the victim IP (157.187.159.183) to mitigate impact.
  3. Investigate upstream providers or network segments for potential source spoofing or compromised hosts.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Alert network operations and incident response teams for further forensic analysis and remediation.
