Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times in the snippet (lines with src IPs 13.124.126.86, 54.211.88.20, and 157.161.40.85).
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- Other ICMP types (0, 3, 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) for potential network issues or other attack types.
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
