Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present (from 35.181.114.142 to 202.194.19.170).  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns over a longer time window to detect emerging threats.
