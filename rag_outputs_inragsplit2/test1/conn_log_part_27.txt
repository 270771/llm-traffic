Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.190.120.127 from multiple source IPs within the 133.16.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many hosts send ICMP Echo Requests rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" commonly used in network anomaly detection.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.16.150.75, 133.16.174.114, 133.16.175.157, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.16.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.190.120.127.
- Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse and consider blacklisting or quarantining affected hosts.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
