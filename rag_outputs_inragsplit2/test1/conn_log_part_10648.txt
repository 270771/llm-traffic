Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.116.11.97 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is triggered by multiple ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.75.115, 133.247.149.55, 133.247.74.240, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP echo requests targeting 3.116.11.97.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts and coordinate with upstream providers for source mitigation.
- Monitor the target host 3.116.11.97 for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
