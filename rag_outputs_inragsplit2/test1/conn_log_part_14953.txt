Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 0 or 8, but there are only 2 instances with ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or repeated ICMP echo requests from a single source to a destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns or spikes in ICMP traffic.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly records.
