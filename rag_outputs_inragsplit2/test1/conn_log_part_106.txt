Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.158.38.252 from multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the instruction referencing heuristic 20 for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.161.44.214, 157.161.37.224, 157.161.164.29, etc.) targeting destination IP 18.158.38.252 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host 18.158.38.252 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and coordinate with upstream providers for mitigation.
