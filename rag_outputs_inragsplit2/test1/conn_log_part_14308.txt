Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 97.246.251.17 to 203.78.187.167, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
