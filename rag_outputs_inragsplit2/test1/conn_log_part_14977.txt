Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.236).  
- The other entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomaly records or heuristics are provided to override this.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if 139.179.133.57 or 203.78.173.236 appear in future anomaly records or logs with higher ICMP echo request counts.
