Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with rapid ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 124.121.97.181
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 163.21.27.229, 163.21.212.36, 163.21.220.43, 163.21.27.226, 133.250.64.44, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to check if 124.121.97.181 is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify relevant incident response teams to investigate the source host and potentially isolate it from the network.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, type, and source consistency of the traffic.
