Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) from the same source to the same destination, nor any anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single OTH (other) connection log entry with ICMP type 11. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or high ICMP traffic volume.
