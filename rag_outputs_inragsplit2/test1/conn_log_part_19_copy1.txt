Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 69.8.91.205 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources in the 130.69.x.x range (e.g., 130.69.199.153, 130.69.41.109, 130.69.35.222, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 69.8.91.205. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 69.8.91.205 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
