Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic, which can be assigned heuristic number 20 (common for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts receiving these pings.
- Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 54.183.69.91 to assess if it is a known malicious actor.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
