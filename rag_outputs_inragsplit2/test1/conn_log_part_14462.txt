Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0, typical for ICMP echo reply or other types, but not type 8 which is echo request). There is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from or to these IPs. Collect more connection logs to identify potential volumetric ICMP anomalies.
