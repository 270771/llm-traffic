Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is evident from this data. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or multiple repeated ICMP packets from the same source IP could be a next step if suspicious activity arises.
