Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 52.230.228.52 with ICMP echo requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP range if they are not legitimate users.
  5. Conduct a deeper investigation to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
