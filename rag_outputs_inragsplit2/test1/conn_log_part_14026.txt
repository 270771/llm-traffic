Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.206.231.130. This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.206.231.130. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests to 54.206.231.130 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.65.56 through 157.17.235.178) if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential escalation.
  4. Consider deploying anti-DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume increases.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
