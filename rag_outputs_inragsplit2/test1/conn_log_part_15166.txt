Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.127.34.186 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.127.34.186; Destination IPs include 163.252.251.215, 163.252.204.143, 163.252.233.229, 163.252.45.103, 163.252.204.188, 163.252.233.103, 163.252.45.56, 163.252.243.31, 163.252.82.223, 163.252.243.182, 163.252.251.176, 163.252.233.90.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.127.34.186 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and affected hosts for signs of service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to assist in blocking malicious traffic from this source.
