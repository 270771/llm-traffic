Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types seen correspond to:  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded (often normal network behavior or traceroute)  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send unusual ICMP types or volumes.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to improve detection accuracy.
