Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 95.75.5.6, and there is only one such instance.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data indicate suspicious ICMP activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive data to apply heuristics effectively.
