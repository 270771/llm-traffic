Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible. 

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show repeated echo requests or anomalies involving these IPs.
