Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), but only one instance with type 8 is present (from 61.24.197.49 to 133.251.66.163).
- The other entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.
- If heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
