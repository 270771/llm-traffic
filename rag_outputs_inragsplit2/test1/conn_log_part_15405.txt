Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided snippet, and fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets are present (in fact, none).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) do not correspond to ping floods or typical DoS flooding patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by collecting more extended logs to check for ICMP type 8 packets.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from or to suspicious IPs.  
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, cross-reference IPs for known anomalies.
