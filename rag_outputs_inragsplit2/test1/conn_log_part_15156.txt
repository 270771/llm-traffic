Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.238.213.5) within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641099670.57). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.84.223, 133.228.167.252, 133.228.189.247, etc.) all targeting destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host (52.238.213.5) for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded service.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update threat intelligence accordingly.
