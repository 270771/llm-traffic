Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not match ping flood or other specific attack heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., ICMP logs or packet captures) to confirm the absence of ping flood activity.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP traffic volume.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS alerts for potential ICMP-based anomalies.
