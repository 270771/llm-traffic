Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.127.34.186 within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records or heuristic context means we assign heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels based on standard ping flood detection criteria.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.127.34.186. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 35.127.34.186 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the attack traffic.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and remediate accordingly.
