Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, only a few entries have ICMP type 8, but there are fewer than 10 such instances overall.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs are indicated, and no anomaly records are found to suggest heuristic 20 or any other heuristic applies.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP packets rather than a high volume flood pattern.  
- One entry shows ICMP type 1 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, and no anomaly CSV records exist, no other attack type can be confidently identified.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs 157.17.53.219, 133.247.1.125, and 203.78.177.156 for unusual behavior if ICMP traffic volume increases.  
- Collect more data and anomaly context to apply heuristics effectively.
