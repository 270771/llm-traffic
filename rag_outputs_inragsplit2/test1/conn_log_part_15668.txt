Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the ICMP code field (field 11), which is `0` in the first entry and `-` (missing) in the second. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required for ping floods, but here the type is not 8.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries total, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not the case here (no anomaly data or heuristic context provided).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types or suspicious behavior.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connection states are OTH (other), and no excessive traffic or repeated ICMP echo requests are present.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged with heuristic 20 or related to ICMP echo requests.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and code data in logs for precise detection.
