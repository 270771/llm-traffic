Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.166.249.180 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP type 8).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs include 133.247.7.218, 133.247.137.176, 133.247.55.222, and others in the 133.247.x.x subnet; Destination IP is 54.166.249.180; ICMP type 8, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.166.249.180.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs if possible, coordinating with upstream providers or internal network teams.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP floods.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP range if attack persists.
