Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. There are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristics indicating suspicious IPs or behavior.

No attack is present. The ICMP type 3 indicates a standard network error message, not an attack. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed based on this data. If ICMP traffic volume or types change, re-evaluate for potential flooding.
