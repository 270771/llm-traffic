Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (third line: src IP 133.247.49.34 to dst IP 195.196.104.26).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 13) correspond to destination unreachable and timestamp requests, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated unreachable messages that might indicate network issues or reconnaissance attempts.
