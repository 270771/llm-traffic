Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.179.180.7) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records means no known anomalous IPs are flagged, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is met and exceeded.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 1: Excessive ICMP Echo Requests**, and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.179.180.7. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host (54.179.180.7) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
  5. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
