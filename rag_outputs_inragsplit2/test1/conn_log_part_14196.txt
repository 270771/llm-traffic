Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.173.100.241) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.173.100.241 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching or relaying the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or mitigating traffic from the attacker IP.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and logging policies to detect and prevent future ping flood attempts.
