Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without signs of flooding or other anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in future anomaly records or if heuristic context becomes available indicating suspicious behavior.  
- Correlate with other logs or network metrics (e.g., packet rate, CPU/network load) to detect potential volumetric attacks.
