Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 0, 1, 3, 8, 13, and others, but the only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is the first line with a single instance.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is the required threshold to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = Echo Reply, 1 = Destination Unreachable, 3 = Destination Unreachable, 13 = Timestamp Request) do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.167.33 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 107.152.18.85 for any unusual behavior or increase in frequency.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
