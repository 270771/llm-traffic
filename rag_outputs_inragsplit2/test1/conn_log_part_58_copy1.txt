Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 157.161.144.242 to 115.232.239.120, and there is only 1 such instance.
- All other ICMP entries have type 0 or other types, which do not qualify as ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets overall, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this threshold.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP activity.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 instance if it recurs frequently.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
