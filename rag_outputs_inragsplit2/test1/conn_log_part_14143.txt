Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.231.100.178, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources to one destination) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.44.18, 133.247.170.55, 133.247.72.65, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 3.231.100.178 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts to prevent recurrence.
