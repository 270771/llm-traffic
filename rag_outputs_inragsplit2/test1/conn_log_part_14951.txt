Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.
