Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags multiple ICMP echo requests from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.221.141.21; Destination IPs include 163.252.231.183, 163.252.79.254, 163.252.29.249, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.221.141.21 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
