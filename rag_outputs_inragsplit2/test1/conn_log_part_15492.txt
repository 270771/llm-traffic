Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8; in fact, none are present in the snippet.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request," and type 0 is "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types and do not alone indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential patterns of repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving heuristic 20 or other heuristics once available.
