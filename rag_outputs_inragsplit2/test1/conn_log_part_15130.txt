Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `1` (seen in the 4th and 6th columns after the source IP), which corresponds to ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) and at least 10 such instances, this traffic does not match the ping flood criteria.  
- Only two ICMP connections are shown, both with type 1, which is not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be confidently made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other ICMP type 8 entries elsewhere in the logs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data to detect possible reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts using other ICMP types.
