Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic with 32 packets but the ICMP type field is 128, which is not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 128 corresponds to Echo Reply in IPv6, so this is not a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) but only 1 packet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any other logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.  
- Correlate with other network logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious activity.
