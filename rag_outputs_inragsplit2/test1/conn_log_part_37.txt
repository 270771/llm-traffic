Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, notably from source IP 18.24.178.88 targeting multiple destination IPs (163.210.x.x range), consistent with a ping flood pattern of repeated echo requests.
- The absence of anomaly records means no known anomalous IPs are flagged, so the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets applies and is met.
- The involved IP addresses are primarily source 18.24.178.88 sending ICMP type 8 packets to various destination IPs in the 163.210.0.0/16 subnet.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type and code fields confirm echo requests (type 8, code 0).

Assigning heuristic number 1 (common ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" as no explicit heuristics or taxonomy are provided.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 18.24.178.88 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this and related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., rate limiting, anomaly detection) to prevent recurrence.
- Review network device logs and traffic patterns for collateral impact or secondary attacks.
