Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request), but only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present.
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic does not show a volume or pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over time or checking for other anomaly sources, but currently, no attack is detected.
