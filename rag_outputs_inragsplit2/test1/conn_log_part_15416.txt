Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The connections mostly show TCP SYN attempts with no further flags, which could be normal scanning or failed connection attempts but do not meet criteria for ping flood or other specific attacks.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture Echo Requests and Replies.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to identify potential ping floods.
