Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 35.183.65.24 targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection (heuristic 20) applies here due to the volume and type of ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.70.54, 163.252.242.176, 163.252.40.211, 163.252.131.237, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
