Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.183.65.24 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one IP) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily in the 133.247.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 157.17.51.152), all targeting destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.183.65.24.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
