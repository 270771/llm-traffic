Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there are no multiple repeated ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) to indicate flooding. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP type 3 record. ICMP type 3 typically signals network or host unreachable errors, which are normal network events rather than attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if further logs show repeated ICMP errors or other suspicious patterns.
