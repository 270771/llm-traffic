Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP traffic in the snippet does not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify ping floods.  
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic between IPv4 addresses with no packet count indicating multiple echo requests.  
- The second entry shows ICMP traffic between IPv6 addresses with 58 packets, but without explicit ICMP type information, it cannot be confirmed as type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connection states are OTH (other), and no flags or counts suggest flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Collect detailed ICMP type information from packet captures or extended logs to verify if ICMP type 8 packets are present in sufficient quantity.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns once heuristic context and anomaly data become available.
