Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is the 17th column; values seen are 20, 1, 1, and 2). None correspond to ICMP Echo Request (type 8), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be sporadic ICMP messages of other types, possibly error or informational messages, but not a flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP types 1, 2, and 20 in this environment to ensure they are expected (e.g., destination unreachable, redirect, or other control messages).  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies.  
- If heuristic or anomaly data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
