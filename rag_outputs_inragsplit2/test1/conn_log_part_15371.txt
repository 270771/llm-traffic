Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 157.17.205.95 to 92.191.60.61 with a single record (count=1). The second record is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this threshold.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 or any other heuristic are present.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Without anomaly records or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or unusual source IP behavior.
