Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two connections from different source IPs (157.17.59.128 and 157.17.231.174) to the same destination (52.236.221.123).
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry (type 9) is not relevant to ping floods, as only type 8 is considered.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the same destination.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP requests or if other suspicious activity is observed.
