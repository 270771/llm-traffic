Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The majority of ICMP entries have type 3, which is "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- Only one entry shows ICMP type 8, and it is a single instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages may indicate network issues or scanning but not a ping flood.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for potential misconfigurations or scanning behavior due to repeated ICMP type 3 messages.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect possible future ping flood attempts.
