Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.187.128.195 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is 8 in all entries, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.78.x.x range are simultaneously sending ICMP echo requests to the same destination, indicating a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (157.78.65.215, 157.78.183.219, 157.78.41.183, etc.) targeting destination 3.187.128.195 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.78.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 3.187.128.195 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for further mitigation.
