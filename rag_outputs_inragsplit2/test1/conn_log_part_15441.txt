Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total 8 distinct instances, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the count requirement.  
- Other ICMP types (0, 1, 3, 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Recommendation:  
- Monitor the ICMP traffic volume for any sudden increase in Echo Requests.  
- Investigate the sources sending multiple ICMP Echo Requests (e.g., 133.247.134.55, 133.247.109.183, 133.247.148.29) for potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.  
- Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, apply standard ICMP flood detection heuristics and maintain baseline traffic profiles.
