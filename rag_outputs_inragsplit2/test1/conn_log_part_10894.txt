Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 18.76.108.217 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (as per your instructions), which flags repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.76.108.217; Destination IPs include 202.194.15.184, 202.194.15.186, 202.194.15.190, 202.194.17.37, 202.194.17.38, 202.194.55.36, 202.194.13.41, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.17.63, 202.194.13.54, 202.194.63.1, 202.194.55.136, 202.194.55.22, 202.194.63.8, 202.194.63.3, 202.194.13.96.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 18.76.108.217 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or other sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
