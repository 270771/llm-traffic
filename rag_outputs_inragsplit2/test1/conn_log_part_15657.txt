Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.
- The traffic does not match other attack patterns such as ICMP type variations or port scans.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply due to lack of anomaly data.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of flooding emerges.
