Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values present are 0, 3, 11, and 13. None of these are type 8, which is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.  
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided conn.log snippet, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative suspicious activity.  
- The ICMP types observed correspond to:  
  - Type 0: Echo Reply  
  - Type 3: Destination Unreachable  
  - Type 11: Time Exceeded  
  - Type 13: Timestamp Request  
These types do not indicate a ping flood but may be part of normal network diagnostics or other non-flood ICMP traffic.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if unusual volumes or patterns emerge, as these can sometimes indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.
