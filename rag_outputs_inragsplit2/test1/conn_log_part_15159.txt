Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 54.253.199.134 to various destination IPs, the total count of such ICMP type 8 instances is fewer than 10 (only 5 distinct entries). Additionally, no anomalies or heuristic matches (such as heuristic 20) are present in the anomaly CSV to justify a lower threshold. Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, no taxonomy class can be assigned. The traffic does not meet the minimum threshold or pattern for a ping flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IP or multiple sources. Investigate if 54.253.199.134 is generating unusual ICMP traffic patterns over time. Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
