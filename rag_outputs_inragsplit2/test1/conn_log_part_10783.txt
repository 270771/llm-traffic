Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP without known exceptions. This matches heuristic 20 (common in ping flood detection taxonomies).
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the volume and nature of ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.167.205, 157.17.188.21, 157.17.114.196, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
  
Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 54.179.180.7.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source if possible.
