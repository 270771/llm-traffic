Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 203.78.177.156 to 196.157.81.84).
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is well below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) traffic is normal network behavior and not indicative of flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests or other anomalies involving these IPs. If the volume of ICMP type 8 packets rises significantly, re-evaluation for ping flood should be performed.
