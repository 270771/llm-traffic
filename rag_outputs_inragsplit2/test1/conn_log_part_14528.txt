Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.47.68.48) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one source IP 202.194.17.61 (though the last entry is ICMP type 3, not type 8), all targeting destination IP 69.47.68.48 on ICMP protocol.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 69.47.68.48.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or mitigate traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and automatically block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
