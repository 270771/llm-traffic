Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time window (~0.004 seconds total). This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.30.12, 133.247.38.29, 133.247.182.84, etc.) all targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (157.187.159.183) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in similar ICMP flooding.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack targeting a single host, meeting the standard detection heuristics despite lack of explicit anomaly metadata.
