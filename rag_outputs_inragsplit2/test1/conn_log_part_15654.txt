Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) total fewer than 10 instances targeting the same destination IP (35.169.51.96), with only 9 distinct entries shown.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The ICMP types are mostly 8, which is consistent with ping requests, but the volume does not meet the minimum threshold of 10 to indicate a flood.  
- No other attack patterns (e.g., ICMP type other than 8 or unusual port activity) are evident in the snippet.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window or checking for other signs of network scanning or reconnaissance.
