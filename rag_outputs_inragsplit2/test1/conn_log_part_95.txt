Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11; none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The ICMP types observed (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) indicate normal error or control messages, not flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The absence of ICMP Echo Requests rules out ping flood, and no other suspicious patterns (e.g., SYN floods or port scans) are evident.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving the source IP 203.65.114.222, which is the consistent sender of ICMP messages here.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly feeds if available to detect evolving threats.
