Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from single source IPs (notably 133.16.14.149 and 18.116.76.138) to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests consistent with ping flood behavior.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this pattern aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags excessive ICMP echo requests as a denial-of-service attempt.
- Involved IP addresses include source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 18.116.76.138, 54.203.245.209, 157.78.78.187, and destination IPs such as 23.79.61.250, 163.210.78.150, 163.210.170.22, 23.222.78.3, 104.78.197.250, among others. Ports are not relevant for ICMP but are consistently marked as 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Engage incident response to investigate potential compromised hosts or external attackers.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify affected network owners and consider blackholing traffic if attack volume threatens service availability.
