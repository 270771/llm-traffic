Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.166.183, 133.247.33.116, 133.247.148.27, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.193.126.151.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
  4. Engage incident response to assess impact and prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
