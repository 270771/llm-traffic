Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 128, none of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no repeated instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types correspond to:
- Type 0: Echo Reply
- Type 11: Time Exceeded
- Type 128: Echo Request for IPv6 (but this is not type 8 in IPv4 ICMP and does not meet the ping flood criteria here)

Next steps:
- Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP type 8 or heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
