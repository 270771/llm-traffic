Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, confirming these are echo requests, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x and 133.228.x.x ranges are flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IP addresses exhibiting flooding behavior.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs if the attack volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.
