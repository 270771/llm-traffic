Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show types 11 and 8 respectively. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The first entry with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods and does not indicate an attack.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other anomaly or threat intelligence feeds.
