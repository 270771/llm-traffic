Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where a single source floods many targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the attacker; destination IPs include 104.96.224.4, 23.87.109.252, 23.213.201.250, 23.182.210.7, 104.71.84.250, 2.211.243.186, 23.230.55.251, 95.100.165.251, 190.189.244.5, 184.166.215.252, 23.93.32.3, 23.183.157.255, 23.78.43.3, among others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP rate limiting and consider disabling ICMP Echo Requests if not required for network operations.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to update detection rules and improve alerting on similar ICMP flood patterns.
