Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically indicates traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed, but monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
