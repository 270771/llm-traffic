Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values of 3 or 11, none have type 8, which is required for echo request (ping) packets. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, the traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack types can be confidently identified from this data. The ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps: Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 sending multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to various destinations, as this could indicate network scanning or misconfiguration. Collect additional logs or packet captures to verify if any other suspicious ICMP traffic (type 8) appears over time.
