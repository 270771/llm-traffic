Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source without known exceptions.
- The involved IP address is the source 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source or other suspicious IPs.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
