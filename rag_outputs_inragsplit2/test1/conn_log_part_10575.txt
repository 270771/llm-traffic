Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is **Heuristic 20** (based on the instruction referencing known anomalous IPs and ICMP type 8 flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: **Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood**.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.104.17, 163.252.79.221, 163.252.195.184, 163.252.195.82, 163.252.18.97, and many others.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type and code fields confirm type 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify affected destination IP owners or internal teams to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls such as ICMP rate limiting or blackholing suspicious traffic.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
