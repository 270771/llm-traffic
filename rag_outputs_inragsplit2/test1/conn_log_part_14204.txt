Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 18.76.108.217 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.76.108.217 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs including 133.102.67.249, 133.102.67.251, 133.102.68.130, 133.102.67.250, 133.102.66.254, 133.102.66.249, 133.102.66.245, 133.102.68.11, 133.102.68.12, 133.102.73.199, 133.102.72.47, 133.102.73.254, and 133.102.76.62.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 18.76.108.217 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
3. Investigate the source host 18.76.108.217 for compromise or misconfiguration.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
5. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
6. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source is external and persistent.
