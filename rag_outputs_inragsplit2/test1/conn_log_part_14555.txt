Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs including ICMP type details and counts.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs with respect to heuristic 20 if it becomes available.
