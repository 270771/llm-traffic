Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack (high volume of ICMP Echo Requests).
- All ICMP packets have type 8, confirming they are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no source or destination ports applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage with upstream providers to filter or throttle the attack traffic if it originates externally.
  4. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS protection services.
