Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time frame, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 counts toward ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.114.109, 157.17.27.236, 157.17.114.118, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 161.67.57.135.
- Monitor the victim host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or mitigate the attack closer to the source if possible.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and remediate accordingly.
