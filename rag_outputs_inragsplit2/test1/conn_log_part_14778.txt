Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), characterized by high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.131.229, 163.252.24.194, 203.78.188.32, and multiple others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify affected destination IP owners if internal to your network.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
