Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The connections target a single destination IP, 54.29.238.156, from multiple source IPs mostly in the 157.17.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests flooding a target) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy network-level filtering or firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets destined for 54.29.238.156.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
- Consider engaging upstream ISP to filter or mitigate the attack traffic closer to the source.
