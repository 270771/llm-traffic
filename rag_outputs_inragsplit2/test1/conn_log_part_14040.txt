Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP echo request (type 8) packets sent to the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.232.1, 133.228.191.247, 133.228.23.230, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8 (echo request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet 133.228.0.0/16.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the source.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider blackholing traffic if the attack escalates.
