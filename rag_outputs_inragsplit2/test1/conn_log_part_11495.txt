Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the IP 18.112.90.42 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches known ping flood behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.112.90.42; Destination IPs include 203.78.177.220, 203.78.176.174, 203.78.189.230, 203.78.179.49, 203.78.176.243, 203.78.176.216, 203.78.179.217, 203.78.187.167, 203.78.191.180, 203.78.179.82, 203.78.190.195, 203.78.190.240, among others. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 18.112.90.42 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source and related IPs.
  3. Conduct a network scan on 18.112.90.42 to identify potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate and contain the source.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems to automate future detection.
