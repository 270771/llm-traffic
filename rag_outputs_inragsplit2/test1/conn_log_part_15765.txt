Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8 and 0, but the first entry shows ICMP type 8 as the destination port, which is unusual and likely a misinterpretation; the actual ICMP type field is not clearly indicated as 8 in both entries.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a higher volume of ICMP type 8 packets appears.  
- Confirm correct parsing of ICMP type fields in the logs to avoid misinterpretation.  
- Monitor the involved IPs (43.140.41.131, 163.252.179.93, 157.17.68.206, 35.169.51.96) for any unusual activity.
