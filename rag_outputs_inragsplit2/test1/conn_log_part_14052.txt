Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from various sources to a single destination, indicating a volumetric ICMP flood attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.250.193, 133.228.164.193, 133.228.151.255, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and update firewall rules accordingly.
