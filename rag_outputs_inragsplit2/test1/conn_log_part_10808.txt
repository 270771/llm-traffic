Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 35.183.65.24, consistent with a ping flood pattern where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types involved in these entries are 8, which matches the requirement for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one IP) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and others (e.g., 157.17.236.43) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.183.65.24. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
  
Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 35.183.65.24.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests from multiple sources.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IP addresses involved in the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity and prepare to escalate to upstream providers if attack volume increases.
- Consider enabling ICMP flood protection features on firewalls and routers protecting the target host.
