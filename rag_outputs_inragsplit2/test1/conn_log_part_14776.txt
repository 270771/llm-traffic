Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) targeting multiple destination IPs. This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests to many targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood or ICMP flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances from the same source, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP address is the source 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.104.1, 163.252.242.227, 133.251.127.203, 203.78.176.249, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and implement anomaly detection rules based on ICMP type 8 frequency.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential collateral impact on network availability.
