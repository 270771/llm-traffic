Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is consistent with ping requests.  
- However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests without signs of volumetric flooding or other suspicious patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency or volume from these source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs become involved in suspicious activity.  
- Investigate if these ICMP requests are part of legitimate network diagnostics or misconfigurations.
