Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 8, and 11. While ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present twice, the count is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is not related to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.
- Without sufficient repeated ICMP Echo Requests or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request frequency or correlating with other logs for suspicious activity.
