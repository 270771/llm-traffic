Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious IPs or known ping flood indicators.
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable detailed ICMP logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to identify emerging ping flood patterns.
