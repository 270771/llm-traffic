Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (protocol field = 6), with no ICMP traffic present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious ICMP activity or known anomalous IPs.
- The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, some with SYN (S0) flags and others with SH (SYN+ACK) flags, but no flooding pattern or ICMP traffic.

Since no ICMP echo requests or anomalies are detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if ICMP traffic logs (icmp.log) are available to confirm absence of ICMP floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated connection attempts from the same IPs.
- If TCP anomalies are suspected, apply heuristics related to TCP SYN floods or port scans, but none are evident here.
