Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP and UDP entries mostly show connection attempts with SYN flags but no further evidence of flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture Echo Requests and Replies.  
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once ICMP data is available.
