Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.160.152.89) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are echo requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard network security heuristics, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range flooding the destination IP 16.160.152.89. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (16.160.152.89) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or internal network teams to trace and mitigate the source of the flood.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Alert incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
