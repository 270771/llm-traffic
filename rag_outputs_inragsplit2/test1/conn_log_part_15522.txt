Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows no ICMP type 8 (echo request) specified, and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest suspicious source or destination IPs related to heuristic 20 or any other known ping flood indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. The connection state is OTH (other), and no further suspicious patterns are evident.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
