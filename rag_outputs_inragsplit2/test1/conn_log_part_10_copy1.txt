Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (the 8th column) shows mostly values 11 and 3, which correspond to "Time Exceeded" and "Destination Unreachable" messages, not Echo Request (type 8).  
- Only two entries have ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), and none have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood requires ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic data available and no anomaly records found).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages suggests normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. However, the lack of ICMP type 8 packets excludes ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or routing issues.  
- Monitor for any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets from this source to detect potential ping flood attempts.
