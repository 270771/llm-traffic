Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances without known exceptions.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.130.224, 133.247.15.62, 133.247.110.193, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan for other hosts receiving similar traffic to identify if this is a broader distributed attack.
4. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Notify the network operations team and consider upstream provider coordination to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
