Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets from different source IPs to the same destination IP (3.116.11.97), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The presence of one ICMP type 10 packet (Timestamp Reply) does not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 3.116.11.97 is experiencing service degradation or other symptoms.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs or anomaly data to apply heuristics for better detection.
