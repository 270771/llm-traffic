Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to analyze. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

Since no anomalies are recorded in the anomaly CSV and no heuristic context is provided, no other attack types can be confidently identified from this data. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, some with SYN flags set, but no flooding or scanning patterns are evident.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts, as conn.log primarily records connection-oriented protocols like TCP and UDP.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to identify potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.
