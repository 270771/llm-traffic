Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with types other than 8, and fewer than 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest suspicious behavior related to ping floods or other attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic and count instances to detect potential ping floods.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from or to suspicious IPs.
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
