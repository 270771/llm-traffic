Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the heuristic of "multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination" indicating a ping flood (commonly heuristic 1 in many taxonomies).
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.179.176, 157.17.73.83, 157.17.45.255, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical and consistently 8 for these entries.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.228.4.24.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood if they are internal or known to be compromised.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP floods or other volumetric attacks.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
