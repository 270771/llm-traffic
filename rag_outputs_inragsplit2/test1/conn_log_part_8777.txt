Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from numerous distinct source IPs targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.212.29.159 and 52.42.116.124). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of many sources sending ICMP echo requests simultaneously to the same destination IPs matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" commonly used in network security.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources such as 157.17.138.50, 133.247.27.184, 157.17.171.193, 133.247.95.153, and destinations primarily 54.212.29.159 and 52.42.116.124. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify affected network owners (54.212.29.159 and 52.42.116.124) to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Monitor network traffic for escalation or changes in attack vectors.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
