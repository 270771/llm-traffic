Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as the current log snippet does not include ICMP data.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known heuristics once anomaly data is available to correlate suspicious IPs or ports.
