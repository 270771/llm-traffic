Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.8.91.205) within a very short time frame (~0.005 seconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range flooding the destination IP 69.8.91.205. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host (69.8.91.205) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage network operations to trace and mitigate the source of the flood upstream if possible.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
  5. Log and alert on continued ICMP flood attempts for further forensic analysis.
