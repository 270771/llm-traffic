Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type not specified, but the ICMP type field is missing or not equal to 8 (echo request). There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo request counts or additional anomaly records indicating suspicious IP behavior.
