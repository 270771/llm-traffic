Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: ICMP type must be 8, and at least 10 such instances must be present targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 to 54.193.126.151.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the destination host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet or misconfigured network devices.
