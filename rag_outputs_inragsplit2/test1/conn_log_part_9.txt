Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a short time window, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 173.50.207.4, 2.213.116.4, 23.230.102.5, 104.121.134.1, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Inform network operations to prepare for potential collateral impact on affected destination IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
