Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 157.17.49.67 to 52.236.221.123, and there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP packet is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if the source IP 157.17.49.67 or destination IP 52.236.221.123 appear in future anomaly records.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
