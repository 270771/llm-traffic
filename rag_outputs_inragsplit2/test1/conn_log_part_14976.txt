Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the volume of ICMP Echo Requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it repeatedly sends ICMP type 8 packets in large numbers.
