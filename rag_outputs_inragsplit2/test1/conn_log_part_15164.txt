Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (35.127.34.186) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Source IP: 35.127.34.186 (attacker)
  - Destination IPs: Multiple (e.g., 163.252.116.237, 163.252.99.227, 163.252.139.119, etc.)
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.127.34.186 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., ICMP rate limiting, anomaly-based IDS signatures).
5. Review upstream provider filtering options to block malicious ICMP traffic before it reaches internal networks.
