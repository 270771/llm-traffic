Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (143.224.65.254) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.210.95.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 143.224.65.254; Destination IPs 163.210.95.92 through 163.210.95.127 (multiple hosts).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8, confirming Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response: Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 143.224.65.254 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools. Notify network operations to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
