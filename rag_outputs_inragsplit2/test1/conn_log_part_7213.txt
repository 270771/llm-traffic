Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (50.239.214.145) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these requests from multiple source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Destination IP: 50.239.214.145 (ICMP does not use ports)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.17.213.220, 157.17.233.49, 157.17.200.202, 157.17.28.57, 157.17.54.214, 157.17.17.207, 157.17.205.88, 157.17.179.31, 157.17.195.110, 157.17.30.144, 157.17.200.195, 157.17.170.238, 157.17.227.115, 157.17.162.69, 157.17.254.19, 157.17.49.169, 157.17.66.234, 157.17.162.27, 157.17.254.1, 157.17.105.85.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 50.239.214.145.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the affected host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic if it originates externally.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve network resilience against ICMP-based DoS attacks.
