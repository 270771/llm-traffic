Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short time frame. There are at least 7 distinct entries with ICMP type 8, close to the threshold of 10, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations strongly suggests a ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available, but based on standard ping flood detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.192.102, 163.252.221.162, 163.252.189.254, 163.252.221.62, 163.252.247.184, 163.252.94.1, and 163.252.1.38. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the relevant port/type.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP floods or related anomalies from this or other IPs.
  3. Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
