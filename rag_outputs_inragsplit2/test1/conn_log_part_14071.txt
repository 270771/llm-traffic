Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal control messages rather than flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of anomalies.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 and 3 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations causing excessive control traffic.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context for deeper analysis.
