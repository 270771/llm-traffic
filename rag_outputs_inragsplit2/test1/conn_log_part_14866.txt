Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 8, and 3. Only two instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The third record is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume of ICMP Echo Requests and presence of other ICMP types suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for suspicious behavior.  
- Investigate the source IPs 163.171.168.73 and 139.179.133.57 if they repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.
