Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (echo request) is from 133.228.251.200 to 68.104.133.69, and it appears only once. The other ICMP entry has type 0 (echo reply) and only 5 packets, which does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic does not match the pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.251.200 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests in future logs.
