Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 13.86.188.134 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood: numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly from many sources to a single target, overwhelming it.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one destination.
- The taxonomy class is likely "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, with heuristic number 20 (common for ICMP flood detection in many frameworks).
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.81.243, 133.247.163.213, 133.247.171.132, etc.) targeting destination IP 13.86.188.134 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor the target host 13.86.188.134 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
