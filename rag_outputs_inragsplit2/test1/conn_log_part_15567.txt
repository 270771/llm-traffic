Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance recorded, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP timestamp request packet. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 13 traffic spikes abnormally, as it may indicate other timing-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations.
