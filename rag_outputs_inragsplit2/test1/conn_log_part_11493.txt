Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.83.92.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse source IPs to a single destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges; destination IP is 3.83.92.175; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.83.92.175.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs sending excessive ICMP requests.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ping flood attacks.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate incident response.
