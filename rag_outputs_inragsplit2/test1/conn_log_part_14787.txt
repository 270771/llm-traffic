Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances total, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20).  
- The connections are marked as OTH (other), with no signs of repeated or high-volume traffic from the snippet.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without additional anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with network traffic volume metrics to detect potential flooding.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity once anomaly data becomes available.
