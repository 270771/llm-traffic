Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to verify if a pattern of ping flooding emerges.  
- Investigate the source IPs (52.42.116.124) and destination IPs (163.252.71.84, 163.252.234.66) for any other suspicious activity or alerts in other logs.
