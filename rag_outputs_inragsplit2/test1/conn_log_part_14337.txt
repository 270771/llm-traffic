Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack (commonly associated with heuristic 20 in many taxonomies, which flags excessive ICMP echo requests).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation on the targeted destination IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources exhibiting similar ICMP flood behavior.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on future excessive ICMP echo request bursts.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle traffic if the attack volume escalates.
