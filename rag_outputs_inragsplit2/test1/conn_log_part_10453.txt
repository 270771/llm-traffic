Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.16.153 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single destination with ICMP type 8) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of the ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.166.58, 157.17.21.74, 157.17.162.72, etc.) targeting destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 44.61.16.153 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
