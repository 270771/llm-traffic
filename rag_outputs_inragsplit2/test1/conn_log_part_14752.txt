Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of any anomaly records and heuristic context further supports no detection of ping flood or related ICMP anomalies.
- The connections mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), indicating possible scanning or failed connection attempts, but not a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated from this data. The S0 state connections could suggest reconnaissance or scanning activity, which typically falls under heuristic categories related to network scanning or reconnaissance (commonly heuristic 1 or 2 in many taxonomies), but no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high number of SYN-only TCP connections for potential scanning or reconnaissance.
- Collect and analyze ICMP logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to capture future ping flood attempts.
