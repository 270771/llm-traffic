Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (timestamp 1641099665.054597), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 sending the single ICMP Echo Request to 185.175.64.6 if it recurs or increases in volume.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
