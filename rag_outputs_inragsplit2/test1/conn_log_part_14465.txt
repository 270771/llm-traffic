Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 again, not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and none at all here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 packets often indicate network issues or scanning but are not inherently an attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 packets (203.78.182.94 and 133.251.203.161) for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other anomalies that might indicate evolving threats.
