Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only two ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present from two different source IPs (161.67.220.144 to 202.124.53.28 and 202.124.53.37).
- The third ICMP packet is type 32, which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window or checking for other suspicious traffic patterns.
