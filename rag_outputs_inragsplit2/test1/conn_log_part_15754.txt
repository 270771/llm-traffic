Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows ICMP type 9, which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. ICMP type 9 corresponds to Router Advertisement messages, which are normal network control traffic.

No heuristic or taxonomy data is available, but given the data, no further immediate investigation is warranted for ping flood. If ICMP traffic volume or types change, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source should be resumed.
