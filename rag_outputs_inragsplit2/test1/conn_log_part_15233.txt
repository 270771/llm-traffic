Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present (count=30 refers to bytes, not number of packets). The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP connection entry. Without multiple repeated echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears normal or benign.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple such entries accumulate rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
