Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 3.231.100.178 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single destination IP, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.107.195, 133.247.170.1, 133.247.44.22, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.231.100.178 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 3.231.100.178.
- Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to trace and mitigate the source of the flood.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if operationally feasible to reduce impact.
