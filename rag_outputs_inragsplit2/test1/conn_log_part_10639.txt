Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.237.185.15 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination").
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and one from 202.194.17.63 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.237.185.15.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
