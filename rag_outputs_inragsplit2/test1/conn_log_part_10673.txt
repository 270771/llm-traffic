Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple source IPs within the 130.197.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (known anomalous src/dst IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" in typical anomaly detection frameworks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (130.197.150.45, 130.197.55.195, 130.197.158.21, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16) to 54.178.233.150 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.
