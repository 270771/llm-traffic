Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo requests) must be 8. In the snippet, there are only two entries with ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The third entry has ICMP type 1 (echo reply), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as ICMP smurf or fragmentation attacks based on the given data.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification applies here due to lack of anomalies and insufficient evidence of attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IPs (157.17.194.39, 133.247.71.129) have any history of suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Correlate with other network data to detect potential slow or low-rate ICMP attacks.
