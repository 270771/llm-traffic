Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.228.4.24 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.19.234, 157.17.18.160, 157.17.165.140, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 157.17.0.0/16 targeting 54.228.4.24.
- Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
- Notify network operations to prepare for potential escalation and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specific to ICMP flood detection.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
