Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets targeting 52.236.221.123 from different source IPs, the total count of such instances is only 6, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, there are no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 to override this count requirement.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types. The presence of ICMP type 13 (timestamp request) from a different source IP does not indicate a ping flood but could be normal or unrelated activity.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests to the target IP to detect potential escalation. Investigate the source IPs for any other suspicious behavior or correlation with known threat intelligence.
