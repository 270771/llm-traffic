Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.249.88.154 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from a single source to multiple destinations.
- The involved IP address is 54.249.88.154 (source), targeting various destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic originating from 54.249.88.154 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify upstream providers or relevant authorities if the source IP is external and malicious.
