Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type other than 8 (the type field is missing but the port field is 0, indicating no echo request), and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the provided data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Collect more comprehensive logs including ICMP type fields and anomaly data for deeper analysis.
