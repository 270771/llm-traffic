Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present according to the given data. The ICMP type 3 typically indicates network or host unreachable messages, which are normal network control messages rather than an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for repeated ICMP type 3 messages could be useful to detect network issues or other anomalies.
