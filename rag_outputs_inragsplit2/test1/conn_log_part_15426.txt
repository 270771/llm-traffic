Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood or related ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple Echo Requests accumulate rapidly, re-evaluate for ping flood activity.
