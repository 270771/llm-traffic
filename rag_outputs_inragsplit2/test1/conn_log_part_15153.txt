Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.238.213.5) within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.169.87, 133.228.79.249, 133.228.160.170, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (52.238.213.5) for performance degradation or service disruption.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the affected host if not required for legitimate operations.

Heuristic number: 20 (based on the known heuristic for ping flood detection requiring multiple ICMP type 8 packets).
Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
