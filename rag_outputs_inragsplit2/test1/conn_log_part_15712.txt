Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Only one ICMP packet with type 8 (echo request) is present in the snippet (timestamp 1641099675.064275).
- The other ICMP entries have types 0, 1, or 11, which do not correspond to ping requests.
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP types 0, 1, and 11 may represent normal network diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (133.228.249.147, 52.236.221.123) appear in future logs with repeated echo requests.
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to improve detection accuracy.
