Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 1 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance per ICMP type is present; the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or multiple repeated packets, this does not match ping flood or typical ICMP-based DoS patterns.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or heuristic 20 if it becomes available.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP attacks.
