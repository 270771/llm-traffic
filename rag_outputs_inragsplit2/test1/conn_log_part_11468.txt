Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.181.17.215) within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse source IPs targeting one destination in rapid succession.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Enable ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response if service degradation occurs.
