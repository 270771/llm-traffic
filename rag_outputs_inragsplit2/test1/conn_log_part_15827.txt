Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.20.96.55 and 52.236.221.123). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short timestamp window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting the same destination(s), which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 3.20.96.55 and 52.236.221.123. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This is a classic ICMP ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy class: Denial of Service - Flooding).
