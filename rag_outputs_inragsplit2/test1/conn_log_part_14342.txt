Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 13.242.241.56
  - Destination IPs: Multiple 163.252.x.x addresses (e.g., 163.252.93.73, 163.252.180.116, 163.252.43.74, etc.)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or similar sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Review and update incident response procedures to handle volumetric ICMP attacks efficiently.
