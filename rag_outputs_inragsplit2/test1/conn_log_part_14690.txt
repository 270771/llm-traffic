Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.211.197.216) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.211.197.216; Destination IPs include 203.78.183.46, 203.78.177.205, 203.78.177.109, 203.78.183.57, 203.78.177.107, 203.78.186.195, 203.78.176.162, 203.78.178.104, 203.78.178.242, 203.78.184.183, 203.78.184.33, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.186.54, 203.78.184.1. ICMP does not use ports.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.211.197.216 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP for potential blackholing.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
  5. Review internal network devices for susceptibility to ICMP floods and apply rate limiting or filtering as needed.
