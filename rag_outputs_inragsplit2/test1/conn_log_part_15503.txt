Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts appear normal or incomplete but do not match known flooding or scanning heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs specifically capturing ICMP traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or related anomalies.
