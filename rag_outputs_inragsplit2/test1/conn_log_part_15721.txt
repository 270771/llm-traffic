Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession from diverse sources to a single target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (133.228.207.254, 133.228.131.194, 133.228.201.230, 133.228.188.0, 133.228.252.62, 133.228.171.198, 133.228.217.204, 133.228.248.1, 133.228.62.233, 133.228.248.6, 133.228.205.222) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.228.0.0/16 subnet) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
