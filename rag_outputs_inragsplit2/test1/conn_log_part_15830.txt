Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the IP 52.236.221.123 and a few others. The volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short timestamp window strongly indicate a ping flood pattern, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is heuristic 20, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.

Involved IP addresses:  
- Targets: 52.236.221.123, 3.20.96.55, 119.100.229.144, 163.252.47.161  
- Sources: Multiple IPs from 157.17.x.x, 133.247.x.x, 61.1.51.193, 112.240.17.137, among others.

Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the field is 0 or "-".

Recommended security response plan:  
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.236.221.123 and other victim IPs.  
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Engage upstream providers to filter or throttle suspicious ICMP traffic sources if possible.  
- Monitor affected hosts for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to broader DoS mitigation services.  
- Conduct forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are spoofed or compromised hosts.  
- Update firewall rules to drop or limit ICMP Echo Requests from identified malicious sources.
