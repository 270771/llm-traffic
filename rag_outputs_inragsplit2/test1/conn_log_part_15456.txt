Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.206.3, 157.17.203.71, 157.17.159.34, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 16.161.126.169. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.161.126.169.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
  3. Monitor the target host for performance degradation or service impact.
  4. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to implement upstream filtering.
