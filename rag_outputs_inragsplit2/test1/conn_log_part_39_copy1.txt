Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- The destination IP 3.20.63.105 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs (mostly in the 133.240.x.x range), indicating a coordinated flood of ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IPs are:
  - Source IPs: Multiple from 133.240.0.0/16 subnet and others.
  - Destination IP: 3.20.63.105

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16) targeting 3.20.63.105.
- Deploy network-level filtering (e.g., firewall rules or ACLs) to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets destined for 3.20.63.105.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack persists.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse to prevent further attacks.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
