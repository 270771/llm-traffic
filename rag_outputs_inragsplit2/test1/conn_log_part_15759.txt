Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 11, and 3. Only type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (from 69.47.68.54 to two different destinations). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
