Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating predominantly from IP 54.9.51.14 targeting numerous destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet, with at least 20 distinct instances visible in the snippet. This volume and pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved. Here, the threshold is clearly met without any known exceptions.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14 is the primary attacker sending ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.0.0/16 range. Other source IPs (35.130.188.37, 73.152.84.127, 218.59.249.48) also send ICMP type 8 packets but in fewer numbers.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8 (echo request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor for additional ICMP flood activity from other source IPs (35.130.188.37, 73.152.84.127, 218.59.249.48) and consider blocking if the pattern persists.
3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify any impact on network performance or availability.
4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise of the attacking host(s).
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
