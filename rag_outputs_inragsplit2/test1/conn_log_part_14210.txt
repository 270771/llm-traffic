Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 cannot be met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts appear to be single connection attempts with no signs of flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to confirm the absence of ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or ICMP error messages.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS alerts for potential ICMP-based anomalies.
