Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods and does not contribute to this detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request and a Time Exceeded message is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.177.156 or destination IP 118.118.219.249 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- If more ICMP Echo Requests accumulate rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using the heuristic of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
