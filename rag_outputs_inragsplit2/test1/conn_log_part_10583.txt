Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the only ICMP type relevant for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a few source IPs (notably 34.25.134.27 and 35.183.65.24) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time window (~0.01 seconds), consistent with a high-rate ICMP echo request flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Sources: 34.25.134.27, 35.183.65.24, 216.131.37.123 (less frequent)
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 163.252.x.x range and 203.78.187.167
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs (34.25.134.27 and 35.183.65.24) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Implement or tune existing Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader attack vectors.
