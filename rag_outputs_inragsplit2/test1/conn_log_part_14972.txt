Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet show ICMP traffic but do not specify ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for ping flood detection.  
- Each entry has only a single instance (count=1), far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack indicators.  
- The ICMP type field is missing or not explicitly 8, so these are not confirmed ping requests.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the ICMP type fields in more detail to confirm packet types.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
