Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.166.249.180) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, confirming these are ping requests.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied (e.g., 133.247.110.31, 133.247.249.251, 133.247.30.188, etc.), indicating a distributed source pattern typical of a flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent use of ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.166.249.180.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16 subnet) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and apply host-based ICMP rate limiting or firewall rules.
