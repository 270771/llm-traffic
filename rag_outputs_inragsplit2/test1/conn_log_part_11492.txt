Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.205.222, 133.228.190.8, 133.228.130.230, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP protocol (port fields are not applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.228.0.0/16.
  2. Monitor the target host 3.83.92.175 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic if the attack volume escalates.
  4. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
