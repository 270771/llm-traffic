Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, which is consistent with ping flood behavior.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet are sending these echo requests, indicating a distributed or coordinated flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the common heuristic for ping flood detection: at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP in a short interval.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Heuristic number: Assign heuristic 1 (common ICMP flood detection) due to lack of explicit heuristics.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Destination IP: 52.181.17.215 (target of the flood)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.228.170.1, 133.228.163.248, 133.228.210.185, and others.
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the network perimeter or firewall.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules on intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- Monitor the target host 52.181.17.215 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage network operations to trace and filter malicious traffic upstream if possible.
- Consider deploying anomaly-based detection to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP traffic.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if the attack persists or intensifies.
