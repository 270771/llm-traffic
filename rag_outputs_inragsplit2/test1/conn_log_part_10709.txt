Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from source IP 69.47.68.36 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, as well as other source IPs (157.17.x.x) targeting 34.25.86.31.
- The pattern of many ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, from a single source IP to multiple destinations, matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"ICMP Flood"** or **"Ping Flood"** under Denial of Service (DoS) attack categories.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 69.47.68.36, 157.17.74.62, 157.17.98.30, 157.17.63.149, 157.17.212.69, 157.17.207.84
- Destination IPs: 163.252.246.198, 163.252.9.146, 163.252.40.112, 163.252.233.86, 163.252.90.244, 163.252.47.183, 163.252.75.57, 163.252.125.154, 163.252.90.233, 163.252.38.17, 163.252.252.124, 163.252.252.62, 163.252.24.195, 163.252.252.126, 163.252.129.73, 163.252.247.219, 163.252.24.231, 34.25.86.31
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the primary offending source IP 69.47.68.36 and other suspicious 157.17.x.x IPs.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
