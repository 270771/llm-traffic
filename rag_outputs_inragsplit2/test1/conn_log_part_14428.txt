Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 1 (ICMP type field is the 7th column after the source IP and port), which corresponds to an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" message, not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, this traffic does not match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another type of attack. The single ICMP connection entry with type 1 and only one instance does not indicate flooding or scanning behavior.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP type 8 messages or if other anomaly data becomes available.
