Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP packets have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, only 4 instances are present in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly data or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation. Correlate with broader network logs and anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs become involved in suspicious activity.
