Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the log have type 3 or 11, not type 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to echo request (ping) packets, which are required to identify a ping flood. Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. ICMP type 3 and 11 indicate destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which may be normal network behavior or indicative of other issues but not a ping flood.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of repeated ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to ensure no underlying network misconfiguration or other attack types (e.g., reconnaissance or scanning) are occurring. Collect more data including ICMP type 8 packets to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
