Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is only one instance with type 8 (from 54.186.116.19 to 163.252.127.140). The other entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood, and no anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.

No attack is present. The single ICMP Echo Request does not constitute a flood. The ICMP type 11 packet may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets correlate with network misconfigurations or routing loops.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
