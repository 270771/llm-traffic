Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping floods but may relate to other network issues or scanning activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristics or taxonomy context, no further classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
