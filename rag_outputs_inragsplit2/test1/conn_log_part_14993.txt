Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, only two entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 192.179.223.214 and 192.179.222.145).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are present to override this count.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 11 and 0) do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No attack is detected. No further investigation is required based on this data alone. If suspicious ICMP traffic volume increases or anomalous IPs appear, re-evaluation should be performed.
