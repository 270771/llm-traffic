Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP echo requests from multiple source IPs (all in the 133.247.x.x range) to the same destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated ICMP ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard detection heuristics, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting a single host).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.247.15.251, 133.247.39.32, 133.247.127.142, etc.)
- Destination IP: 157.187.159.183
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the port fields are zero or dash.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to the targeted IP (157.187.159.183).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for broader attack context.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
