Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range.
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (pings), matching the known pattern for ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP echo requests from one source to many destinations strongly indicate a distributed ping flood attempt.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include 163.252.156.1, 163.252.133.254, 163.252.90.251, and multiple others in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (echo request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls such as ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection alerts.
