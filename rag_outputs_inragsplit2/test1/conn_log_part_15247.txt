Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance present is a single occurrence between 161.67.51.15 and 202.100.175.250, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 128, which is not type 8 and therefore not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP echo request does not constitute an attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 161.67.51.15 or destination 202.100.175.250 appear in future anomaly records or heuristic matches.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify any emerging patterns.
