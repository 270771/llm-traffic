Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.250.193, 133.228.199.246, 133.228.160.134, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms these are Echo Requests (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block the attacking source IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion on the target host.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from identified attacking IPs if mitigation at the network edge is insufficient.
