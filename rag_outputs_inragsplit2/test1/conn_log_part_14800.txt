Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two records from different source IPs (210.122.61.86 and 210.122.63.254) targeting 52.238.213.5, each appearing once. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The third record is ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply) from 133.228.62.234 to 96.201.51.163, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests and replies at very low volume.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly datasets.  
- If ICMP traffic volume spikes or other heuristics become available, reassess for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
