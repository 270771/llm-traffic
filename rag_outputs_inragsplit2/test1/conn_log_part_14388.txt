Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.127.18.10, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied (e.g., 133.247.154.230, 133.247.75.227, 133.247.148.3, etc.), indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class “Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood.”
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IPs are primarily multiple sources attacking 35.127.18.10.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 35.127.18.10 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs to detect potential amplification or multi-vector attacks.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the targeted host’s availability and performance.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
