Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.206.231.130) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.206.231.130.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Enable ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and escalate to incident response if service degradation is observed.
