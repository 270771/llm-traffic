Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple different source IPs. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.254.9, 157.17.61.14, 157.17.64.210, etc.) targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in similar ICMP floods.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation or blackholing.
