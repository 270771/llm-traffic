Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are found.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as the current snippet only shows TCP/UDP.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or alerts to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs to apply heuristic 20 if applicable.
