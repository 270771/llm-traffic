Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 11 message typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

No immediate security response is required for ping flood. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (202.194.36.224) to the destination (64.57.61.30) is recommended to detect any future ping flood attempts.
