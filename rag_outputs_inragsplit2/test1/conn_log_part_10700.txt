Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.206.231.130 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets in a short interval targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.251.76, 157.17.249.50, 157.17.66.225, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.206.231.130.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider blackholing traffic if the attack escalates.
