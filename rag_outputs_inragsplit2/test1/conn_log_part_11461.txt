Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.181.17.215) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP in the 133.228.x.x range, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests flooding the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions) related to ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to overwhelming ICMP echo requests aimed at exhausting the targetâ€™s resources.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.228.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 52.181.17.215; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to detect and filter excessive ICMP traffic.
- Monitor the target host (52.181.17.215) for performance degradation and potential collateral impact.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic closer to the source.
