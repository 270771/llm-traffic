Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable" and type 13 indicates "Timestamp Request," this traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate other network diagnostic or error messages.

No known heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here due to lack of data, but ICMP type 3 and 13 traffic is generally benign or related to network troubleshooting.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 3 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to detect other potential threats.
