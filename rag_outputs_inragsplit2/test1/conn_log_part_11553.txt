Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178). This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to the same destination IPs matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IPs 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct forensic analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on volume, ICMP type, and traffic pattern.
