Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (echo request) targeting a single destination IP (54.29.238.156) from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (known anomalous IPs or high-volume ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.111.190, 157.17.98.40, 157.17.105.251, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.29.238.156. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering of ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.29.238.156.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Engage incident response to assess potential impact on the target host and prepare mitigation strategies.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
