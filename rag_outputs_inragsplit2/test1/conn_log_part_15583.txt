Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the IP 16.160.152.89 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.228.176.57, 133.228.141.12, 133.228.221.176, etc.) are flooding the destination 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 16.160.152.89 for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP ranges if they are known malicious or external.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
