Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting two distinct destination IPs: 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window (~0.002 seconds), indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, suggesting a distributed source pattern typical of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping flood detection) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the involved IPs are:
  - Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.247.30.8, 157.17.128.62, 133.247.95.253, etc.)
  - Destination IPs: 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to reduce the flood volume.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate internal hosts.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic sources.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
