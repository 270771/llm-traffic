Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 13.86.47.233. This matches the classic ping flood pattern where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, satisfying the threshold for detecting a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.175.139, 133.247.139.228, 133.247.242.217, etc.) targeting destination IP 13.86.47.233 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 13.86.47.233.
- Monitor the target host for performance degradation and ensure critical services remain operational.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses and remediate accordingly.
