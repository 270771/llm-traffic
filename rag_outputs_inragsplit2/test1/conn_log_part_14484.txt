Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP traffic; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic matches related to ICMP or ping flood behavior.
- The traffic mostly consists of TCP SYN attempts (S0 state) and UDP packets on port 8888, which may indicate scanning or other UDP-based activity but not a ping flood.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the UDP traffic on port 8888 further, as multiple UDP connections from 130.197.163.236 to various destinations may indicate suspicious scanning or amplification attempts.
- Apply heuristic 17 (likely related to UDP anomalies) for further analysis.
- Monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request floods to detect ping flood attacks promptly.
