Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 128, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping). However, there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.2).  
- The other ICMP types (128 and 11) are not echo requests and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomalous IPs or heuristics are provided to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) and 128 (echo reply) is normal in network diagnostics.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify any pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests that might indicate a ping flood.  
- Investigate if any IPs show unusual ICMP traffic volume or patterns once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
