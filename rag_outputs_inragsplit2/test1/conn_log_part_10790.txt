Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these requests from many different source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so heuristic and taxonomy must be assigned based on standard knowledge: this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.179.180.7. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy or tune DDoS mitigation tools to detect and filter ICMP flood traffic.
- Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs and consider upstream filtering or blackholing.
- If possible, temporarily disable ICMP Echo Replies on the target host to reduce impact.
