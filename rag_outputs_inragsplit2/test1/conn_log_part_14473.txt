Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly data or heuristic context is available, and only one ICMP echo request is logged, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.

No other attack patterns are evident from the single connection record. Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP (52.181.50.194) to the destination (163.252.12.108). If the count increases beyond 10 within a short time frame, investigate for potential ping flood activity. Also, gather anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
