Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.*.* range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts in the 163.252.*.* range.
- Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 54.183.69.91 to assess if it is a known malicious actor.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential ongoing DDoS activity.
