Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly not 8 (echo request). For example, the entries show ICMP type values of 1 and 0, but only one entry has type 0 (which is echo reply), and none have type 8.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is not met here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as ICMP smurf or fragmentation attacks based on the given data.

No heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the purpose of the ICMP traffic with type 0 and 1 to ensure it is legitimate network diagnostic or error messages.  
- Collect more detailed logs or packet captures if suspicious ICMP activity increases.
