Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time frame. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: high volume of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the most relevant heuristic would be heuristic 20 (related to known anomalous IPs) if any were present, but since none are found, this is a straightforward ping flood detection.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.28.143, 133.247.39.76, 133.247.184.195, etc.) targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (echo request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are targeted similarly and update firewall rules accordingly.
