Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.33.149.154 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances, indicating a flood rather than normal ping activity.
- The pattern of many unique source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination IP is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches common heuristic #20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources in 133.247.20.20 through 133.247.244.0 range; destination IP 34.33.149.154; ICMP protocol, type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host 34.33.149.154 for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
6. Consider temporary blackholing or sinkholing traffic to the victim IP if the attack volume escalates.
