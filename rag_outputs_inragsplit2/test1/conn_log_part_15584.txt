Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 16.160.152.89 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8 except one entry with type 1, which is a reply and not relevant to the flood detection.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and one from 161.67.42.226 targeting 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.228.0.0/16 and 161.67.42.226) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor the target host 16.160.152.89 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
