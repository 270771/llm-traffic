Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping), but there are only 3 instances total, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
