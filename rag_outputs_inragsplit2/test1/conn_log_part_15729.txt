Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) typically indicate network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly generate ICMP error messages, which could indicate misconfiguration or reconnaissance.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
