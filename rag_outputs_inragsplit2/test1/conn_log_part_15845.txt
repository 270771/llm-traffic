Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to a single target matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one host.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.28.57, 157.17.66.237, 157.17.103.40, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here (type 8).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests to the target IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential amplification or distributed attack sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services if not already in place.
