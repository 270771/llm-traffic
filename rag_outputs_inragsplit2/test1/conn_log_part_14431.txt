Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 157.17.49.67 to 3.115.224.159, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply), which does not count toward ping flood detection.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the instance count requirement.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another type of attack.

No attack is present. Further investigation is not immediately necessary based on this data, but monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated requests from the same IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
