Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 0, 1, 128, and 129, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise or indicate known suspicious IPs related to heuristic 20.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 128 and 129 correspond to ICMPv6 Echo Request and Echo Reply, but their low counts and lack of type 8 packets exclude a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMPv6 traffic (types 128 and 129) for potential anomalies or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated ICMP traffic from the same IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
