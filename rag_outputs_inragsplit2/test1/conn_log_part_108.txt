Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 157.161.40.85 to 13.57.116.142, and there is only 1 such instance in the snippet.
- All other ICMP entries have type 0 or 3 or 11, none of which qualify as ping flood indicators.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (such as heuristic 20) are present to override this threshold.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages is normal in network operations and does not imply flooding or DoS.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if counts exceed 10 from a single source IP.
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 packet source (157.161.40.85) if it recurs frequently.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
