Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 25 ICMP connections from source IP 143.224.94.6 to multiple destination IPs within the 133.26.144.x subnet, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different hosts strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP Echo Request Flood").
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Attacker/source IP is 143.224.94.6; multiple destination IPs in 133.26.144.130-159 range; ICMP protocol, type 8, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 143.224.94.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other sources.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical hosts.
