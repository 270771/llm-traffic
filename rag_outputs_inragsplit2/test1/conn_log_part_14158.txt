Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (54.220.233.141) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short time frame (~same timestamp). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where a host sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous ICMP echo request floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.220.233.141; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.220.233.141 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and increase logging for further forensic analysis.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to automatically detect and respond to similar volumetric attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
