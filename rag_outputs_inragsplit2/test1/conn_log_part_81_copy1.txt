Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances (specifically 22) of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a volumetric ICMP ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.76.120.97; Destination IPs include 163.21.213.11, 163.21.120.63, 203.65.127.222, 133.250.64.25, and multiple others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack if it persists.
