Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The two ICMP entries show ICMP types 8 and 0, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present per source IP.
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.
- The traffic does not match the volume or pattern expected for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity once heuristic context or anomaly data becomes available.
