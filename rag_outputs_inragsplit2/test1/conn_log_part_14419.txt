Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types present are 0 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal network control messages, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP traffic patterns if they emerge, especially if heuristic 20 or other known heuristics become available.
