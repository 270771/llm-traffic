Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only three entries have ICMP type 8, each targeting different destination IPs, and the total count of ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10.  
- Other ICMP types present (11, 3, 1) are not related to ping requests and thus not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show repeated, rapid ICMP echo requests from a single source to a single destination, which is typical of ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) and type 3 (destination unreachable) suggests normal network diagnostic or error messages rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP exceeding 10 instances to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 35.130.188.37 if it starts generating more frequent ICMP echo requests.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify any emerging suspicious behavior.
