Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets or network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The involved IP is the source IP 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.14.252, 133.251.127.198, 203.78.178.187, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  3. Monitor network traffic for similar patterns from other hosts.
  4. Notify network operations to prepare for potential collateral impact on affected destination IPs.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
