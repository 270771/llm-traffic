Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 11 and 8, but only one instance of type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (11) correspond to Time Exceeded messages, which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The single ICMP echo request does not constitute an attack pattern.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 73.59.166.197 sending the single ICMP echo request if it recurs frequently or in bursts.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
