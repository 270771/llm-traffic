Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.173.100.241, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection by volume and type) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 157.17.29.254, 133.247.180.3) targeting destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 35.173.100.241 for service degradation and consider isolating it from the network if impact is severe.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic from suspicious IPs.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
