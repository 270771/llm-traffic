Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical).
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous src/dst IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and others (e.g., 133.247.239.246, 157.17.254.11) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting the flood behavior.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services hosted on 52.236.221.123.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter malicious traffic if attack volume escalates.
