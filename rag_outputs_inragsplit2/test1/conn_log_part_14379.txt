Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 133.247.150.129 to 35.127.34.186, and there is only 1 such instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry from 133.228.62.233 to 103.198.5.125 has ICMP type 11, which is not type 8, so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other suspicious patterns in related logs.
