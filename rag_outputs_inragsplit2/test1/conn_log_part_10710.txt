Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the IP 34.25.86.31 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and from 69.47.68.36 to various 163.252.x.x IPs, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context means we assign a default heuristic number 20 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources including 157.17.54.233, 157.17.17.58, 157.17.98.40, 157.17.98.70, 157.17.22.134, 157.17.63.224, 157.17.224.198, 157.17.231.254, 157.17.212.101, 157.17.17.207, 157.17.113.156, and 69.47.68.36 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 34.25.86.31 and various 163.252.x.x IPs.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target IP 34.25.86.31 for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if the attack volume increases.
