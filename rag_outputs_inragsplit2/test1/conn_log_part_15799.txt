Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic, commonly referenced as heuristic 20 in many detection taxonomies, which flags high-volume ICMP echo request floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IPâ€™s legitimacy and network segment to determine if it is compromised.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected parties (owners of destination IPs) to prepare for potential service degradation or further attacks.
