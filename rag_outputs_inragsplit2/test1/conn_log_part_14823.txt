Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.37.79.118 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination without known exceptions. This matches the observed data.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.75.229, 133.247.81.6, 133.247.215.168, etc.) are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 34.37.79.118 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 34.37.79.118 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and assess if these IPs are compromised hosts.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic is volumetric and beyond local mitigation capabilities.
