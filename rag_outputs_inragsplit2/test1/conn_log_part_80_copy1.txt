Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.76.120.97; Destination IPs include 163.21.172.29, 163.21.33.53, 163.21.130.42, 133.118.132.208, and many others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source IP is external and the attack persists.
