Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.237.221.62) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances, indicating an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.151.193, 157.17.231.254, 157.17.191.234, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to implement upstream filtering or blackholing.
