Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.36.162.241, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 130.197.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 211.156.88.104) targeting destination IP 18.36.162.241 on ICMP type 8. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 18.36.162.241.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs sending excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering with the ISP.
