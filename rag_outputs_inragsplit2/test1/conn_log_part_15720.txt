Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to overwhelming ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.190.7, 133.228.82.122, 133.228.213.7, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
  
Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify the affected system owner and prepare for potential service degradation or outage mitigation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests automatically.
