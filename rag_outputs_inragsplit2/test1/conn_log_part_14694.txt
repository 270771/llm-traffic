Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (at timestamp 1641099666.947054), which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate the source IP 13.211.197.216 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
