Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping floods, so this is consistent with potential ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 8 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, and no known suspicious IPs are identified in the data.  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests without the volume or pattern indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency or volume from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if any IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if any of the destination IPs report service degradation or network issues coinciding with this traffic.
