Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP type, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type.

No further action specific to ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for unusual ICMP traffic patterns or other anomalies is recommended.
