Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099640.05). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.183.65.24 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (35.183.65.24) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking the attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume, ICMP type, and concentration on a single target IP.
