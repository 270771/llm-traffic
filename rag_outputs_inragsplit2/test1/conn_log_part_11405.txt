Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179 targeting many different destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to multiple targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the network or hosts.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: ICMP type 8 traffic with at least 10 instances from the same source(s) to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Sources: 54.183.76.138, 3.122.197.179
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 163.252.x.x subnet
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible amplification or reflection attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or malicious activity.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic, allowing only legitimate diagnostic pings from trusted sources.
