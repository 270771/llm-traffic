Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: high frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations.
- The involved IP address is the source 124.121.97.181 sending ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.21.65.53, 163.21.211.221, 203.65.114.251, etc.). ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP and related sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching this attack.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected network owners of the targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential impact.
