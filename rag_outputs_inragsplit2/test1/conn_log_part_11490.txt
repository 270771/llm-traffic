Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.210.10, 133.228.208.3, 133.228.198.158, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.83.92.175. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.83.92.175.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse within the 133.228.0.0/16 subnet.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.
