Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 8 and 0. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential volumetric ICMP attacks.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
