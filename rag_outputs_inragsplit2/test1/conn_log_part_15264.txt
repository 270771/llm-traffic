Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the logs is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), so this traffic could be ping-related.  
- However, only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic volume and frequency shown do not match typical ping flood patterns, which involve a high rate of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming the target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential reconnaissance or low-rate scanning activity.
