Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 15 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window, consistent with a volumetric ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches the heuristic of "at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8" indicating a ping flood.
- The involved IP addresses include multiple sources from the 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x ranges targeting 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the repeated ICMP echo requests confirm the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets.
- Notify network operations to monitor the targeted IPs for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known to be malicious.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.

Heuristic number: 10+ ICMP type 8 packets without known exceptions (default heuristic for ping flood detection).  
Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood.
