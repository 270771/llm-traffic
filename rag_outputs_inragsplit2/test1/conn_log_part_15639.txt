Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" based on standard ICMP flood attack classifications.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121 is the attacker; destination IPs include 163.252.25.198, 163.252.67.98, 163.252.1.199, and many others as listed in the log snippet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed throughout.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to identify compromise or misuse.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting for early warning.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if attacks persist.
