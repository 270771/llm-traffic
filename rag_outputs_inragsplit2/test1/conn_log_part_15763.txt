Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect potential ping floods.
- Enable or review ICMP logging in Zeek or other network monitoring tools.
- Monitor for other suspicious TCP connection patterns, such as SYN floods or port scans, given the many S0 (SYN sent, no response) flags in the TCP connections. These could indicate reconnaissance or other DoS attempts.
