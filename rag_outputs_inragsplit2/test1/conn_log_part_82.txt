Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (133.16.14.149) to many different destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm network resources by flooding with echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (known anomalous IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" in typical anomaly detection frameworks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 23.179.212.0, 23.93.38.3, 23.87.216.9, 23.231.3.255, 23.70.181.253, 63.19.108.63, 104.90.1.253, 23.73.97.253, 23.245.219.228, 23.180.163.2, 23.85.236.3, 23.189.104.5, 23.230.11.251, 23.240.229.252.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical and all relevant entries are type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misuse.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
