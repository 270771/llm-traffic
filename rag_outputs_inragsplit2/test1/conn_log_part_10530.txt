Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.186.100.117) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the volume and nature of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.0.0/16 subnet; destination IP 54.186.100.117; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request); port fields are 0 as expected for ICMP.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the target IP.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS mitigation capabilities to automatically detect and block such floods.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and remediate accordingly.
