Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.179.180.7. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Additionally, monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for service degradation and consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP filtering on the host to prevent service disruption.
