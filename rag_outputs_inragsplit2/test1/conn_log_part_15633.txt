Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous IP behavior related to ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 16.172.102.121; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request); ports are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Implement network-wide ICMP flood detection and alerting to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify affected destination IP owners if they are within your administrative domain.
