Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25), indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with flooding behavior.
- Multiple distinct source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are sending these ICMP echo requests simultaneously, suggesting a distributed or coordinated flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this pattern aligns with common heuristic #20 (known anomalous src/dst IPs) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: 
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in 133.247.26.197, 133.247.111.30, 133.247.150.132, etc.
  - Destinations: 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block traffic from the suspicious source IP ranges.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation and prepare mitigation strategies such as traffic scrubbing or blackholing if necessary.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
