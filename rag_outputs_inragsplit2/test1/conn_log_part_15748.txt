Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references an anomaly with heuristic 504 (HTTPS traffic anomaly), unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood, but no such heuristic or matching IPs appear in the data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 504 further, as it indicates suspicious HTTPS traffic on port 443 from source IP 203.78.129.205.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if any other logs (e.g., ICMP logs) are available to cross-check for ping flood indicators.
