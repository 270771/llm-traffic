Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP echo request (type 8) packets directed at the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming they are echo requests, which are used in ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting a single host).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range and 203.78.182.23 targeting 157.187.159.183 on ICMP (no ports for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
- Notify network operations to investigate potential upstream sources and consider blackholing or filtering offending IPs.
- Review and update incident response playbooks to include ICMP flood scenarios.
