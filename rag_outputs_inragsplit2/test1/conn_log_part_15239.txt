Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 ICMP connections from source IP 15.130.145.131 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to various targets match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 15.130.145.131; Destination IPs include 202.194.55.215, 202.194.58.65, 202.194.55.136, 202.194.17.37, 202.194.55.37, 202.194.17.38, 202.194.17.63, 202.194.15.184, 202.194.15.188, 202.194.58.110, 202.194.63.1. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 15.130.145.131 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP for potential blackholing.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., IDS/IPS signatures, rate limiting).
  5. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to identify compromise or misuse.
