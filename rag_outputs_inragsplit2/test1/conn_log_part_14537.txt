Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IPs (notably 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The rapid succession and volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to the same destination IPs indicate an attempt to overwhelm the targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (≥10) from various sources to a single or few destinations.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (based on the prompt’s mention), which relates to known anomalous IPs or ping flood behavior.
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 133.247.182.167, 157.17.61.28, 133.247.96.195, 157.17.175.202, 133.247.54.221, 133.247.38.4, 157.17.189.39, 157.17.104.207, 157.17.167.255, 133.247.30.19, 157.17.167.29, 133.247.50.141, 133.247.185.54, 157.17.107.36, 133.247.182.90, 157.17.167.139, 133.247.87.151, 157.17.107.31; targeting primarily 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235.
- Ports are 0 for ICMP, which is expected.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor affected hosts (157.187.159.183, 3.118.117.235) for service degradation or outages.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers).
6. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
