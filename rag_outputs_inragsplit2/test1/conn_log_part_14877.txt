Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it is not a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP record shows type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance of type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceed the threshold.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged by heuristics related to ICMP traffic volume or source/destination IP reputation.
