Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present, but each source IP sends only a single instance; there are no repeated or sustained ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets towards 52.239.117.247 is 10, but these come from distinct source IPs, not a flood from one or few sources.  
- No ICMP type other than 8 is involved, and no source or destination IPs are flagged as anomalous in the anomaly CSV (which is empty).  
- The lack of repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same IP or a high volume from a single source means the traffic does not match the known ping flood pattern, which requires at least 10 instances from the same source or known anomalous IPs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no direct heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 52.239.117.247 is experiencing any service degradation or other suspicious activity.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for potential distributed scanning or reconnaissance activity given multiple distinct sources pinging the same target.
