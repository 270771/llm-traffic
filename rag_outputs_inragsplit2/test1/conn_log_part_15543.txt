Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (from 130.197.147.190 to 16.160.194.189).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) or type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic if it correlates with other suspicious activity.
