Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests distributed to different destination IPs, not a high-volume flood targeting a single host.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, no further immediate action is required.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 35.119.5.36.  
- Investigate if these echo requests correlate with any network performance issues or alerts.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm if a pattern of flooding emerges.
