Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP traffic or anomalies, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack can be confirmed.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., icmp.log) to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests are present.
- Enable or review anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to catch potential ping floods.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other heuristics related to ICMP anomalies once available.
