Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs repeatedly (notably 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156), indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from ranges 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
- If possible, engage upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source.
