Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The observed ICMP type 11 traffic could be related to network diagnostics or routing issues rather than an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors could be useful to detect other network issues or attacks.
