Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (52.190.120.127) within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where multiple hosts simultaneously flood a target with echo requests to overwhelm it.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous source IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.7.x.x range; destination IP: 52.190.120.127; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 52.190.120.127.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host for performance degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from suspicious or unexpected regions.
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are similarly targeted or involved.
