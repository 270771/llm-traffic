Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present, and thus no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to analyze. Without ICMP type 8 packets, the traffic cannot match the criteria for a ping flood attack.

No anomalies or heuristics related to ICMP or ping floods are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic appears to be normal TCP connection attempts, some with SYN flags set (S0), but no evidence of flooding or ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate ICMP logs or other Zeek logs (icmp.log) to check for any ICMP echo request floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs.  
- If TCP SYN floods or other TCP-based anomalies are suspected, analyze SYN rates and connection failures further.
