Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field (4th column) shows mostly values 3 and 11, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, not Echo Request (type 8).
- Only one entry has ICMP type 1 (Echo Reply), and none have type 8.
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, the traffic does not match the required pattern for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error and informational messages, not a flood.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for unusual volumes of ICMP error messages (types 3 and 11) could be prudent, as they may indicate network issues or reconnaissance activity.
