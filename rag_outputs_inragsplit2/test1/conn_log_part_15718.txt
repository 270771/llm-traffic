Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.169.82, 133.228.249.55, 133.228.190.8, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blocking the attack traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential denial-of-service impact.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
