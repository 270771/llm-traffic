Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one IP) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and the single destination IP 52.237.221.62. ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), port fields are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the target host.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP ranges if attack persists.
