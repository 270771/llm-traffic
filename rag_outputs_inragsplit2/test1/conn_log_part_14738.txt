Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.23.202.254, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), characterized by multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse source IPs to a single destination.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.23.202.254. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.23.202.254.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not legitimate users.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
