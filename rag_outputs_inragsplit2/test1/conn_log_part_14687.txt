Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 3, 3, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 1 and 3 correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Destination Unreachable (Host Unreachable)" messages, which are normal ICMP error messages rather than flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source and destination IPs for unusual patterns or repeated ICMP error messages that might indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
