Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP record present, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomalies or heuristics are found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic context is provided. The traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could represent normal ICMP error messaging.

Next steps: Investigate if multiple ICMP type 11 messages are occurring frequently, which might indicate network issues or traceroute activity, but no immediate attack response is warranted.
