Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack pattern. By default, this fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 133.251.127.243, 203.78.181.188, 163.252.29.247, and multiple others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected parties if internal hosts are targeted.
