Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 10 corresponds to Router Advertisement, which are normal control messages, not flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages, which could indicate misconfiguration or other issues.
