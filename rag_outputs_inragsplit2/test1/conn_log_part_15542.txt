Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance per ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 1 is an Echo Reply, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts show unusual ICMP behavior or other anomaly indicators once heuristic context or anomaly data becomes available.
