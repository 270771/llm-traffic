Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known anomalous IPs or exceptions (such as heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not match other attack patterns explicitly, as no other ICMP types or suspicious flags are present.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs (133.228.187.199, 133.228.250.199, 133.228.248.6, 133.228.201.237, 133.228.212.91) have any history of suspicious activity.  
- If the count of ICMP type 8 packets rises above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood.  
- Consider enabling rate limiting or alerting on ICMP echo request spikes as a precaution.
