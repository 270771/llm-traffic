Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the IP 34.44.165.118, which matches the known pattern for a ping flood attack (ICMP type 8, high volume).
- The source IPs are numerous and varied within the 133.247.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed or spoofed source pattern typical of ping floods.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (high volume ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources from 133.247.7.17 through 133.247.253.121 targeting destination 34.44.165.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests to 34.44.165.118 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.247.0.0/16 if possible.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers for potential source mitigation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and apply host-based ICMP rate limiting.
