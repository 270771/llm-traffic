Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition indicative of a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without additional anomaly or heuristic context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these IPs.  
- Collect a longer time window of conn.log data to verify if the count exceeds the ping flood threshold.  
- Investigate the source IP 54.250.161.90 for unusual behavior or reputation issues.
