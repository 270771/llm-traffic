Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" by common cybersecurity standards.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement.
  3. Notify upstream ISP or hosting provider about the abusive IP for possible mitigation.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the IDS/IPS.
  5. Review and harden network devices against ICMP-based DoS attacks.
