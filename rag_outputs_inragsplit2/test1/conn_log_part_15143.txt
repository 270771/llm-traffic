Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically, as conn.log primarily logs connection-oriented protocols.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs or Zeekâ€™s icmp.log to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
