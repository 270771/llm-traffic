Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically normal network control messages, not indicative of flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages, which could indicate misconfiguration or other issues.
