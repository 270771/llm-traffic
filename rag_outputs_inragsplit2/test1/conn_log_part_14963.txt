Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance with ICMP type 8 (139.179.133.57 â†’ 203.78.173.249), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods but could be related to other network issues or scanning activity.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other types of ICMP-based reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no specific taxonomy or heuristic can be assigned.
