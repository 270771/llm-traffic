Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.127.34.186 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with ICMP echo requests to overwhelm them.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.127.34.186; Destination IPs include 163.252.126.146, 163.252.126.246, 163.252.9.149, 163.252.116.252, 163.252.125.214, 163.252.104.17, 163.252.7.145, 163.252.96.57, 163.252.9.166, 163.252.74.6, 163.252.7.151, 163.252.104.16, 163.252.246.187, 163.252.246.251, 163.252.43.89, 163.252.9.190, 163.252.43.115, 163.252.52.248.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.127.34.186 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and servers for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in the network monitoring system.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to take action against the attacker source.
