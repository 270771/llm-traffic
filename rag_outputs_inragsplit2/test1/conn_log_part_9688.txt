Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.152.76.54, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) and multiplicity of unique source IPs targeting the same destination IP strongly indicate a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IP 54.152.76.54. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.152.76.54.
- Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to filter or block offending source IPs if possible.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and services hosted on 54.152.76.54.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from identified attacking IP ranges if attack persists.
