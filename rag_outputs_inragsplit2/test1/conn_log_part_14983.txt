Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 traffic (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.234). The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- The other ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods and does not indicate flooding behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP messages without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports with heuristic 20 or related ping flood heuristics once available.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect potential denial-of-service symptoms.
