Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (129.43.87.6) to multiple destination IPs within a short time frame, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets matches the classic pattern of a distributed ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.87.6; Destination IPs range from 163.210.95.25 through 163.210.95.63.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 129.43.87.6 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
