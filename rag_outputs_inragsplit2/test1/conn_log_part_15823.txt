Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one destination rapidly.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.39.47, 157.17.250.114, 157.17.239.88, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect if this is part of a larger distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and affected stakeholders to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
