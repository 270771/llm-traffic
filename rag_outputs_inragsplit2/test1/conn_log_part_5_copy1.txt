Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the TCP connection attempts shown; these appear to be normal or failed TCP connection attempts (S0 and SH states) without further evidence of scanning or flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as lack of ICMP data limits detection.
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in ICMP traffic.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts to complement Zeek data.
