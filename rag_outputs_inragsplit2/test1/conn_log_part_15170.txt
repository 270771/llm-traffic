Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting the IP 34.44.165.118 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (e.g., heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources such as 157.17.235.178, 133.228.170.47, 157.17.235.139, and others all targeting destination IP 34.44.165.118 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP protocol and type 8 confirm the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 34.44.165.118.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP flood behavior.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.
