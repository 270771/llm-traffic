Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request). In the snippet, four entries have ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP (52.236.221.123), but only four instances are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- One entry has ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP Echo Requests rather than a volumetric flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to the same destination to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the destination IP 52.236.221.123 for any signs of service degradation or other anomalies.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics and taxonomy for better classification.
