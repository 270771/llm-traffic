Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and far fewer than the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, which are normal network control messages rather than attack indicators.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
