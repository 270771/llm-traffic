Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or behaviors related to ICMP.
- The traffic consists mainly of TCP SYN scans or connection attempts (S0 state), which may indicate scanning activity but not a ping flood.

Since no ICMP traffic is detected, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is present. The observed TCP SYN attempts could be indicative of reconnaissance or scanning activity, which typically falls under heuristic categories related to network scanning or reconnaissance (commonly heuristic 1 or 2 in many taxonomies), but no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs involved in repeated TCP connection attempts for potential scanning or probing.
- Enable ICMP logging to capture and analyze any future ICMP traffic for ping flood detection.
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts to identify if scanning activity escalates to an attack.
