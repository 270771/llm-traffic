Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 1, or 3, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 0, 1, and 3 correspond to Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable, and Source Quench or other control messages, which are normal or diagnostic traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.7.211, which appears frequently sending ICMP type 3 packets, to ensure no misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Enable logging or anomaly detection for ICMP type 8 traffic to catch any future ping flood attempts.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify ICMP anomalies in the future.
