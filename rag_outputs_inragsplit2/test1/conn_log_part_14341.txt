Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include 163.252.176.126, 163.252.5.196, 163.252.176.114, 163.252.159.24, and many others as listed.
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or throttle traffic from this source if the attack persists.
