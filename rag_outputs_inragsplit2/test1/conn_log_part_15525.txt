Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Without heuristic context or anomaly matches, no further immediate action is warranted. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic for multiple type 8 packets from the same source IP is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
