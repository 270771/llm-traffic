Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one from 223.137.139.194 (though that one is ICMP type 0, not 8, so excluded), all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 and volume from multiple sources indicate coordinated flooding.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.236.221.123.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs (157.17.213.81, 157.17.206.3, 157.17.206.1, 157.17.61.30, 157.17.75.118, 157.17.17.207, 157.17.170.238, 157.17.170.201, 157.17.63.62, 157.17.213.220, 157.17.76.160, 157.17.213.139, 157.17.76.173, 157.17.250.233).
- Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and consider upstream provider coordination to mitigate attack traffic.
