Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.87.6 to multiple destination IPs in the 163.210.95.x range, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.87.6; Destination IPs 163.210.95.179 through 163.210.95.203; ICMP type 8; no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 129.43.87.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts.
- Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks from this or related IPs.
