Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating primarily from IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time window (~2 seconds). This pattern of rapid, repeated ICMP type 8 packets matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 104.88.25.3, 23.179.127.251, 66.150.190.17, 23.70.136.252, 23.70.252.253, 104.115.54.4, 64.86.9.78, 23.238.214.1, 104.127.116.5, 96.198.124.247, 23.213.188.6, 2.209.31.3, 2.214.105.251, 104.113.22.2, 104.127.206.5, 23.94.123.255).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here (type 8).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic from untrusted sources.
