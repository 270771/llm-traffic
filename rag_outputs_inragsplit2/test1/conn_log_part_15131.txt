Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP entries mostly show connection attempts with flags like S0 (SYN sent, no reply), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type and count to identify future ping flood attempts.
- Review network devices and firewall logs for ICMP anomalies or rate-limiting triggers.
