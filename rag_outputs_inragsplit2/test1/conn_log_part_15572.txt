Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 0, 1, or unspecified (the last field in Zeek conn.log for ICMP type is the 22nd field; here values are 1, 58, and 1, none of which are 8).
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP packets per source IP is very low (1 or 0), far below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and increased frequency from any source IP.
- Investigate any future anomalies with heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and count data for comprehensive analysis.
