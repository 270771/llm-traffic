Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only 3 times in the snippet (lines with src IPs 58.198.151.10, 139.179.133.57, and 202.44.0.218). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or do not match type 8, which are not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.44.0.218 which sent 28 packets in one connection (last line) for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, re-evaluate with that context.
