Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the provided entries is 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 or any other heuristics are present, and no anomaly records were found in the anomaly CSV.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 0 (Echo Reply) or is not type 8, so it does not contribute to a ping flood pattern.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs start generating 10 or more ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, which would then meet the ping flood criteria.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
