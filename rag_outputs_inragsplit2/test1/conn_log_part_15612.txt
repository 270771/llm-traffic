Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances confirms no ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions, which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ICMP Echo Request floods.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging or alerts.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) if such data becomes available, as it may override the 10-instance threshold.

No ping flood or related ICMP anomaly is detected in the current dataset.
