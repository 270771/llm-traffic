Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), not 8 (Echo Request), except for only two entries with ICMP type 8.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error and informational messages rather than a flood of echo requests.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could focus on the two ICMP type 8 entries to verify if they are benign pings or part of a low-volume scan, but this does not meet ping flood criteria.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the source IPs 16.161.143.184 and 13.47.187.108.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools for any emerging suspicious patterns.
