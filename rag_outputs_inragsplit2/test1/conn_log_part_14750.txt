Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (139.179.133.57 â†’ 203.78.173.63).  
- The other ICMP entries have types 0 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is not met here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests over a longer time window or checking for other suspicious traffic patterns.
