Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 35.173.100.241, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these requests from multiple source IPs (mostly in the 157.17.x.x range) to one destination IP strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.115.248, 157.17.25.198, 157.17.8.40, 157.17.174.216, 157.17.174.251, 157.17.50.31, 157.17.5.195, 157.17.8.105, 157.17.8.108, 157.17.5.196, 157.17.174.240, 157.17.54.214, 157.17.111.62, 157.17.50.157, 157.17.169.74, 157.17.169.188, 157.17.169.201, 157.17.61.12, 157.17.111.155, 157.17.138.198, 157.17.61.58; Destination IP: 35.173.100.241; ICMP type: 8; Port fields are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the victim IP.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 35.173.100.241.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IPs if they are known malicious or outside expected traffic patterns.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further mitigation.
