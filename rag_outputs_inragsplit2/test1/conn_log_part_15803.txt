Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 52.236.221.123 and 163.252.82.193.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating known suspicious IPs or behavior.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if 52.236.221.123 or 163.252.82.193 appear in future anomaly records or logs with higher ICMP echo request counts.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
