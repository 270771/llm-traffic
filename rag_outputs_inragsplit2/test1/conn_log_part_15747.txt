Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not present here. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type.

No known heuristic or taxonomy applies to this traffic. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
