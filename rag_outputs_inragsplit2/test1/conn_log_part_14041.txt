Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time window (timestamps around 1641099662.378â€“1641099662.382). This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.175.200, 133.228.175.193, 133.228.162.1, etc.) are flooding ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.228.0.0/16 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or outages.
3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
4. Deploy or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate ICMP floods.
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This is a clear and active ICMP ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
