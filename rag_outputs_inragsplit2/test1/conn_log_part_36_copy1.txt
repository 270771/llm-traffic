Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting a single destination IP 69.8.91.205 from multiple source IPs within the 133.227.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: ICMP type must be 8 and at least 10 instances must be present, both conditions met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.227.22.5, 133.227.115.19, 133.227.219.162, etc.) flooding destination IP 69.8.91.205 on ICMP (port 0).
- Recommended response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 69.8.91.205.
  2. Investigate and isolate the source IPs within 133.227.0.0/16 subnet to identify compromised hosts.
  3. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ongoing ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from identified malicious sources if attack persists.
