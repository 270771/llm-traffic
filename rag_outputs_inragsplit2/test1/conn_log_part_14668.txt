Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.3.45, 157.17.27.31, 157.17.237.193, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet 157.17.0.0/16 to the victim IP 52.237.221.62.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or internal network teams to contain or remediate the source hosts.
- Monitor for collateral impact and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block similar ICMP floods in the future.
