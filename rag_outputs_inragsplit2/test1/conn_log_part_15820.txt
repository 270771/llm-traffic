Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but only 7 distinct connections targeting the same destination IP (52.236.221.123) are observed, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- No anomalies or heuristic matches (e.g., heuristic 20) are found in the anomaly CSV to override the instance count requirement.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect evolving attack patterns.
