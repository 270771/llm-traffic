Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack characterized by a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting the victim IP.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet or coordinated attack sources.
  4. Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider blackholing traffic if the attack escalates.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to update heuristics and anomaly detection rules based on this event.
