Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries, only TCP and UDP connections.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic matches related to ICMP or ping floods.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided logs. The connections mostly show normal TCP/UDP SYN attempts and some UDP traffic, none matching known ping flood patterns.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP traffic specifically, filtering for type 8 packets.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IP.
- Enable logging or anomaly detection for heuristic 20 if it becomes available, as it relates to known anomalous IPs in ping flood contexts.
