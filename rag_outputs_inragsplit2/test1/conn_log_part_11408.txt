Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from two source IPs: 3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- This pattern of numerous ICMP echo requests in a short time frame to multiple targets matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests to degrade network performance or cause denial of service.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood detection. The taxonomy class is best assigned as **"Denial of Service (DoS)"** due to the nature of the flooding.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 3.122.197.179, 54.183.76.138
  - Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 163.252.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 163.252.105.193, 163.252.255.108, 163.252.237.214, etc.)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs (3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138).
2. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating traffic from these sources.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued or new ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
5. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation or outages.
6. Conduct a post-incident review to update detection heuristics and improve alerting for similar volumetric ICMP attacks.
