Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 13.248.91.214 to destination 203.65.103.15, and there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet.
- The majority of ICMP traffic shown is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not indicative of a ping flood.
- No source or destination IPs match any known anomalies or heuristics (none provided).
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood is not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or scanning activity but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 13.248.91.214 for any further ICMP Echo Requests in a broader time window.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect scanning or reconnaissance activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
