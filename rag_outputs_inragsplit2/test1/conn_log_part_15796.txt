Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.194.193, 163.252.158.35, 163.252.179.237, 163.252.45.181, 163.252.14.165, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant here since ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching this attack.
4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the offending IP if the attack persists.
5. Implement or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
