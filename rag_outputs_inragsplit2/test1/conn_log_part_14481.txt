Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 1 (ICMP type field is the 4th column after source IP, which is "3" here, but the ICMP type is actually indicated by the "icmp" protocol and the "1" in the 6th column, which corresponds to ICMP type 1, i.e., "ICMP Destination Unreachable," not type 8 which is Echo Request).  
- Since the ICMP type is not 8 (Echo Request), these packets do not represent ping requests and thus cannot be part of a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets logged, which is far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other type of attack.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could focus on the nature of these ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to understand if they indicate network misconfigurations or other issues, but they do not indicate a ping flood.
