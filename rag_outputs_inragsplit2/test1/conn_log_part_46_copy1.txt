Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values 3 and 11, which correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Time Exceeded" messages, not Echo Request (type 8).  
- Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (timestamp 1641790889.540482), which is insufficient to meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present to override the count requirement.  
- The traffic pattern does not match typical ping flood behavior, which involves multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests from one or more sources to a target.

No anomalies were found in the anomaly CSV, and no heuristic or taxonomy context is provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the sources sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages to understand if there are underlying network issues or misconfigurations causing these errors.  
- Collect more data or enable more detailed logging to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
