Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.22 and from 223.165.122.245 to 133.102.173.170).  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded) or 0 (Echo Reply), which do not indicate ping flood initiation.  
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is well below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are present to override this.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 and 0 packets is normal for network diagnostics and error reporting.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP errors that might indicate other network issues.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate accordingly.
