Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a few source IPs (notably 133.16.14.149 and others) targeting multiple destination IPs.
- This pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests to various targets is consistent with a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests), and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs include source IPs such as 133.16.14.149, 192.0.46.x/192.0.47.x range, 157.78.x.x, and destination IPs like 18.98.73.236, 23.x.x.x, 184.x.x.x, and others. Ports are not relevant here as ICMP does not use ports.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 133.16.14.149.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flooding and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic sources for possible upstream filtering.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
- Conduct a forensic review of affected hosts to ensure no compromise has occurred due to the DoS attempt.
