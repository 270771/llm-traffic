Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 4 and 0, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if additional logs show ICMP type 8 traffic with high frequency.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs.  
- Collect and correlate more data to identify potential anomalies or heuristic matches.
