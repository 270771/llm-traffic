Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 13.79.120.156 to destination 202.100.174.62, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 11 and type 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, so this does not match the ping flood pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related logs.
