Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.102.51, 157.17.200.202, 157.17.151.157, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from known malicious regions.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
