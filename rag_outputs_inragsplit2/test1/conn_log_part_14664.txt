Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.237.221.62) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from diverse sources targeting one destination.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.168.2, 157.17.167.200, 157.17.176.244, etc.) flooding destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Investigate and isolate the source IPs within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet to determine if they are compromised or part of a botnet.
  3. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or coordinated attacks.
