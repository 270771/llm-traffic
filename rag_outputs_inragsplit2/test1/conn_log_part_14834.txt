Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 128, which is not type 8 (echo request), so it does not indicate a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request) but only a single instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. Given the lack of multiple ICMP echo requests and no known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign or unrelated to ping flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data become available that might indicate suspicious activity.
