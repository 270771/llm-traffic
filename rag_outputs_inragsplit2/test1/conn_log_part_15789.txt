Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (more than 10) from one source to many destinations.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IP: 52.236.221.123
- Destination IPs: Multiple (e.g., 163.252.254.193, 163.252.79.221, 163.252.246.160, etc.)
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement or review existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
