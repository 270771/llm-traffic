Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.158.38.252 within a very short time window (~0.04 seconds). This matches the classic ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (high volume ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall. Monitor the target host 18.158.38.252 for service degradation. Consider deploying an ICMP flood mitigation appliance or cloud-based DDoS protection service. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
