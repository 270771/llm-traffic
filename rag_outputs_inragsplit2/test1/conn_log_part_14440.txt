Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries; all records are TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP and UDP connection attempts mostly show single SYN packets (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable logging or monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.
- Correlate with other anomaly sources or heuristics once available to improve detection accuracy.
