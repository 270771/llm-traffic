Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.65), which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest suspicious behavior or known malicious IPs.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume and mixed ICMP types suggest normal or incidental ICMP traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination 203.78.173.65 appear in future anomaly reports or show repeated ICMP echo requests.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
