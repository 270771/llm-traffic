Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 8, and 11. Only two instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 11 could be normal network behavior related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (203.78.177.156, 35.130.188.37, 133.228.62.233) show other suspicious activity in broader logs.  
- If more ICMP type 8 packets appear rapidly from these or other IPs, re-evaluate for ping flood conditions.
