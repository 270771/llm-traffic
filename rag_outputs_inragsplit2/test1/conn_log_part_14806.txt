Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are mostly 11 and 8. Only a few entries have ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 overall.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and other types indicates normal network diagnostic or error traffic rather than a flood of Echo Requests.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets over time to detect emerging ping floods.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data once available to identify suspicious IPs or patterns.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
