Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from two source IPs: 35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm the target(s) with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.

Involved IP addresses:
- Sources: 35.183.65.24, 34.25.134.27
- Destinations: Multiple IPs in the 163.252.x.x subnet (e.g., 163.252.21.198, 163.252.241.67, 163.252.215.218, etc.)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (35.183.65.24 and 34.25.134.27).
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and expand blocking rules if additional sources appear.
- Notify affected network owners of the targeted IP ranges (163.252.x.x) to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and take appropriate remediation steps.
