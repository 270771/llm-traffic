Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources: 133.228.171.200, 133.228.79.254, 133.228.79.249, 133.228.171.198, 133.228.168.106, 133.228.168.61, 133.228.168.57, 133.228.198.198, 133.228.175.198, 133.228.99.249, 133.228.198.158, 133.228.175.193, 133.228.167.252, 133.228.175.200, 133.228.116.244, 133.228.116.254, 133.228.164.193, 133.228.164.200, 133.228.79.184, 133.228.167.253; all targeting destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP (port 0).
- Most likely heuristic: 20 (based on common heuristic numbering for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target IP 52.181.17.215 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
- Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
