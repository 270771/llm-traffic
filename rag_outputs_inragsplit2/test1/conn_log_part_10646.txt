Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- Specifically, no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- Without at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or any anomalous IPs flagged by heuristic 20, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic explicitly (e.g., via Zeekâ€™s icmp.log or packet capture) to detect potential ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for other suspicious TCP/UDP connection patterns that might indicate scanning or other DoS attempts.  
- Implement logging and alerting for ICMP Echo Requests to enable detection of ping floods in the future.
