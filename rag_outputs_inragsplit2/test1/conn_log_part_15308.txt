Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 54.253.199.134 to 133.102.66.245, but there is only 1 instance recorded, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request and a single ICMP Destination Unreachable does not constitute an attack pattern.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IP 54.253.199.134 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
