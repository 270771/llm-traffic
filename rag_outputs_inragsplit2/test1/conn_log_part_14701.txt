Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets or network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.241.39, 163.252.255.236, 203.78.180.43, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify affected destination IP owners if internal to your network.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
