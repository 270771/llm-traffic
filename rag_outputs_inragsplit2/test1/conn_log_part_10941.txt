Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.173.100.241) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 35.173.100.241.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or participation in a botnet.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor network and host performance metrics for signs of degradation or resource exhaustion.

This is a confirmed ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic targeting a single host.
