Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 163.171.168.73 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria specify at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances as indicative of ping flooding, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73 is the attacker; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.31.20, 163.252.245.240, 163.252.44.214, 163.252.99.228, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
