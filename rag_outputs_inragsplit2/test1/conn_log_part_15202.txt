Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are mostly not 8 (echo request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (second line: src IP 203.78.177.156 to dst IP 122.247.233.57).  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (3, 11, 0) correspond to destination unreachable, time exceeded, and echo reply, which are not indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the threshold of 10+ ICMP echo requests is met.  
- Investigate the source IP 203.78.177.156 for unusual ICMP activity as it is the only source sending ICMP type 8 here.
