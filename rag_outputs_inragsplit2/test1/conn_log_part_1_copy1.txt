Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show normal or failed connection states (S0, SH, RSTR) without signs of flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to capture Echo Requests and Replies.
- Monitor for heuristic 20 or other known anomaly indicators once anomaly data is available.
