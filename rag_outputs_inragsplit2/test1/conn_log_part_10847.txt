Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP types in the snippet are 8, which corresponds to echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns such as port scans or TCP floods, as the protocol is ICMP and the count is low.

No heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs (35.100.170.152, 78.116.131.149, 61.175.151.116) have appeared in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect any degradation that might indicate early-stage flooding.
