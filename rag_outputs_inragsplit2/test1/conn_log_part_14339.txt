Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is triggered here: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP targeting multiple destinations.
- The involved IP address is the source 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP Echo Requests to various destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or other suspicious sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
