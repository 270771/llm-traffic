Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior matches a classic ICMP ping flood attack pattern, which typically aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple anomalous sources targeting one destination with ICMP type 8) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (157.17.188.157, 157.17.104.0, 157.17.206.92, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if the source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
