Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is represented by the 7th column (protocol) and the 6th column (ICMP type). Here, the ICMP types observed are 13, 0, and 0.
- A ping flood requires ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is not present in any of the entries.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The entries show ICMP traffic but not of the echo request type used in ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 13 (Timestamp) and type 0 (Echo Reply) traffic if unusual volume or patterns emerge.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 packets that might indicate a developing ping flood.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
