Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.76.138) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.76.138 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any are critical assets.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential sources of ICMP floods.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate filtering.
- Review and update incident response procedures for volumetric ICMP attacks.
