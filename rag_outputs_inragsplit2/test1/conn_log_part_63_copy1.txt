Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears to be normal or unrelated to ping floods.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the nature of ICMP type 0 traffic (Echo Reply) to ensure it is expected and not part of a reflection attack.  
- Monitor for any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets or anomalies involving these IPs.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify any future anomalies.
