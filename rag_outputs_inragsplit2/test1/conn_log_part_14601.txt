Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3, 1, 0, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for a ping flood and there are no entries with type 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed correspond to destination unreachable (3), echo reply (0), and possibly other control messages, which are normal or unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if ICMP type 8 traffic appears in other logs or over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests or anomalies in source/destination IP behavior.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
