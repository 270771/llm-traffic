Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) rather than type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No known heuristics or taxonomy apply here due to lack of data, but the traffic pattern does not match ping flood or other common ICMP-based attacks. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious ICMP types from these IPs to detect evolving threats.
