Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.237.221.62) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 52.237.221.62 sending ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 52.237.221.62 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if 52.237.221.62 is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Notify upstream ISP to assist in filtering or mitigating the attack traffic closer to the source.
