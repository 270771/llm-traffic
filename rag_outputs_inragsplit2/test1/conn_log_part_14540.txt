Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets within a very short time window, targeting two distinct destination IPs: 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235. This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests is consistent with a ping flood pattern, where multiple sources send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved. Here, the threshold is clearly exceeded without any exceptions.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges.
  - Destination IPs: 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor and log ICMP traffic for further escalation or identification of compromised hosts.
- Notify network operations to investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
- If possible, temporarily block or restrict ICMP traffic to the targeted destination IPs until the attack subsides.
