Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be 8 (Echo Request). In the provided logs, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (last line), and it is a single instance.
- There are not at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is the threshold for detecting a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (none are found).
- Most ICMP entries have types 3 or 11, which correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, not ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate network issues or scanning but not flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity or scanning behavior.
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious patterns.
