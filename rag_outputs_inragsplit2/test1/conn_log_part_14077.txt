Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 18.11.193.42, which matches the pattern of a ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- The volume of unique source IPs (e.g., 133.247.x.x, 130.197.x.x) sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP within a short time frame strongly indicates a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to a single destination) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Destination IP: 18.11.193.42 (target)
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.247.157.241, 133.247.21.59, 133.247.14.254, 130.197.190.247, 130.197.60.23, etc.
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.11.193.42.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for broader attack patterns.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and consider temporary ICMP blocking on the host firewall.
