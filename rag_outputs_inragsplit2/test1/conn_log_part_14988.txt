Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 124.190.25.100 to 133.102.213.152 and from 139.179.133.57 to 203.78.173.228). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (type 3) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) is normal network behavior and not indicative of flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of ping flood emerges over time.
