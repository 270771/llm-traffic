Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.34.27.210) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type present, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and distribution of source IPs (multiple different 157.17.x.x addresses) sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated flood rather than normal network behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs involved in ICMP floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP 18.34.27.210; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request); ports are not applicable for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 18.34.27.210.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 157.17.x.x subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify the affected system owner and coordinate with upstream providers to apply traffic filtering or blackholing if the attack volume escalates.
- Monitor network traffic continuously for further ICMP flood attempts and adjust firewall rules accordingly.
