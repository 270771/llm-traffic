Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.127.34.186 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources targeting a single destination, overwhelming it.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs include 133.247.49.34, 133.247.19.40, 133.247.129.116, 133.247.54.40, 133.247.153.68, 133.247.38.82, 133.247.44.20, 133.247.54.83, 133.247.11.30, 133.247.38.250, 133.247.19.27. Destination IP is 35.127.34.186. ICMP does not use ports.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 35.127.34.186 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious ICMP traffic upstream.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
