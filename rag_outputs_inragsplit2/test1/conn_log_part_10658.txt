Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type in the log is 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only 1 instance recorded, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP timestamp request. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns involving these IPs.
