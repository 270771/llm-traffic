Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets could be related to traceroute or routing issues, which are normal network behaviors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 packets correlate with network troubleshooting or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
