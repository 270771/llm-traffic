Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.173.100.241) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria are met: more than 10 ICMP type 8 instances from the same source IP targeting multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241; Destination IPs include 163.252.242.176, 163.252.103.224, 163.252.250.102, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
