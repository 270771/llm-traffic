Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 73.90.204.98 to 203.78.187.167, and there is only one instance of it.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other protocol anomalies, but currently, no ping flood or related attack is detected.
