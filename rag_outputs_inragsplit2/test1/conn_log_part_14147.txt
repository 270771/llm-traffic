Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from multiple source IPs (notably 161.67.42.226 and various 133.247.x.x addresses) targeting a single destination IP 3.231.100.178.
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is: ICMP type must be 8 and at least 10 instances must be present unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not indicated here).
- The taxonomy class is likely "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood subtype.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 161.67.42.226, 133.247.31.48, 133.247.23.143, 133.247.116.210, 133.247.105.156, 133.247.148.7, 133.247.31.190, 133.247.0.191, 133.247.87.163, 133.247.34.172, 133.247.105.207, 133.247.109.38, 133.247.109.39, and others in the 133.247.x.x range.
- Destination IP: 3.231.100.178
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 3.231.100.178.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are compromised hosts participating in a botnet.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host 3.231.100.178 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from suspicious or unexpected regions.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is appropriately controlled and logged.
