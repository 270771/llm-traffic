Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with single instances, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP packet-level logs to detect potential anomalies.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or attacks.
