Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 13, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance per ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without ICMP type 8 traffic or anomaly flags, this traffic appears normal or unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any future logs showing repeated ICMP Echo Requests or matching heuristic 20 if available.
