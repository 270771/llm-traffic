Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.127.18.10) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here. The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the volume and nature of the traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.42.126, 133.247.24.25, 133.247.61.98, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.127.18.10 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host (35.127.18.10) for service degradation and consider isolating it if performance is impacted.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a forensic review to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
