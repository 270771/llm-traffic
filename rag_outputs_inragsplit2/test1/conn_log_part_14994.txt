Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the snippet, there are only 3 instances where ICMP type 8 is present (lines with src IPs 192.179.223.249, 192.179.222.10, and 192.179.223.210 targeting 18.100.239.147).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 3 and 13) are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they are unexpected or unauthorized in the network environment.
