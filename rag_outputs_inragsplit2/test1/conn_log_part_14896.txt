Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 8, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood attack.  
- The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The low volume of ICMP Echo Requests and absence of anomalies suggest normal or benign ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Request volume from the same or other IPs.  
- Investigate if any IPs repeatedly send ICMP type 8 packets in bursts exceeding the threshold.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
