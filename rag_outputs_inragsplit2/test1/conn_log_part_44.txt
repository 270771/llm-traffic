Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating predominantly from the IP 133.16.14.149 to numerous destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of one source IP sending many ICMP echo requests to multiple destinations is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 (main attacker), multiple destination IPs including 23.230.246.7, 184.201.182.2, 23.93.174.0, 23.245.5.5, 23.71.162.2, 104.65.202.4, 23.255.184.250, 184.206.163.248, 23.179.212.0, 2.209.218.7, 23.230.176.248, 104.70.122.252, 23.189.111.251, 23.81.76.252, 23.222.247.251.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (echo request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any additional ICMP flood attempts from other IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
