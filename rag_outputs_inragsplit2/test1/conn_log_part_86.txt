Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of either 3 or 11, none have type 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- The count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are not indicative of ping floods but may relate to network troubleshooting or other issues.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity patterns.
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
