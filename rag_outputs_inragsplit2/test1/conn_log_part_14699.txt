Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the basis of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances (24 entries) of ICMP type 8 packets originating from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) targeting multiple destination IPs, consistent with a volumetric ICMP ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 133.251.127.225, 163.252.132.19, 203.78.184.198, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
- Notify affected destination IP owners if internal to your network for coordinated response.
