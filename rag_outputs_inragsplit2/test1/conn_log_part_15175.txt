Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP packets have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but there are only 4 instances in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other sources to the same destination IP. If the count exceeds 10 or if anomaly data appears, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the source IPs for any unusual behavior or reputation issues.
