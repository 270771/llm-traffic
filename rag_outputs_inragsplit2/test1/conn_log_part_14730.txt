Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not match other attack patterns based on the given data.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.237.221.62 to multiple destination IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts with suspicious behavior.  
- If the count of ICMP type 8 packets rises above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood.
