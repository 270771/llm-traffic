Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many source IPs to one destination IP in a short time frame.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one in 223.129.196.121 (though that one is ICMP type 0 and can be ignored), all targeting destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here and is consistently 8 for the majority of entries.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.229.78.71.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from multiple sources.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.

Heuristic number: 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection based on multiple ICMP type 8 packets).
Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
