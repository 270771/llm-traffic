Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP traffic, especially type 8, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate network traffic captures or logs that include ICMP protocol details to confirm absence of ping flood.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious IPs.
- Enable anomaly detection rules for ICMP traffic to catch future ping flood attempts.
