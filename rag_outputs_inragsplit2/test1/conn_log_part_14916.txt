Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are mostly not 8 (echo request). Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (133.247.49.34 â†’ 2.16.9.3), but there is only a single instance of this type.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here (no anomaly data found).  
- Other ICMP types (0, 11) are present, which do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest another attack type.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could focus on the single ICMP echo request to verify if it is part of normal traffic or a low-level scan, but it does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.
