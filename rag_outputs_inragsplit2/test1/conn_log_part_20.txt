Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 129.43.174.6 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting multiple destination IPs in the 202.252.225.x subnet. ICMP type 8 is the standard ping request, and the volume and rapid succession of these requests strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, which involves overwhelming targets with numerous ICMP echo requests.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic to assign is heuristic 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs related to ping floods). The taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Attacker/source IP: 129.43.174.6
- Multiple destination IPs: 202.252.225.225 through 202.252.225.245 (at least 20 distinct targets)
- Protocol: ICMP, type 8 (Echo Request)
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.174.6 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source host 129.43.174.6 for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacker IP if the attack persists.
6. Review and update incident response procedures to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
