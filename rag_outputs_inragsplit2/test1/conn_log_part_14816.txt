Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the snippet shows values 0, 8, and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There are only 3 entries total, with only 2 entries showing ICMP type 8.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network traffic.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (61.1.51.193, 159.109.108.200, 139.179.133.57) show repeated suspicious behavior or match known threat intelligence.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
