Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present and exceed 10 instances, primarily targeting 174.140.131.228 and 69.47.68.36.
- However, the timestamps and counts do not indicate a rapid flood from a single source; rather, multiple distinct source IPs send isolated ICMP type 8 packets.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known malicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.
- The traffic pattern lacks the volume and persistence typical of a ping flood attack, which usually involves a high rate of ICMP type 8 packets from one or few sources to overwhelm a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP traffic appears normal or low-volume scanning/pinging activity.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Request frequency from single sources.
- Investigate the sources 130.197.*.* and 210.122.*.* ranges for unusual behavior if volume spikes.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
