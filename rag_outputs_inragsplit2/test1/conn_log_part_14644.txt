Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (such as heuristic 20).  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic matches, this traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior history of suspicious activity once anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available.  
- Correlate with other logs or alerts to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
