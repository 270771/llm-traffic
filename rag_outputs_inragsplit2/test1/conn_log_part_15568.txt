Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type observed in the snippet is 0 and 8 (from the dst port field, which for ICMP is the type). The first entry shows ICMP type 128 (which is not type 8), and the second entry shows ICMP type 8.  
- However, there are only 2 ICMP entries total, and only one with type 8. The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports are identified.  
- The traffic does not match the volume or pattern of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if the source IP 157.17.234.185 or destination IP 84.115.57.223 appear in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
