Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the destination IP 50.239.214.145 from many different source IPs, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: ICMP flood detection).
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources such as 133.228.168.106, 133.228.243.193, 52.230.228.52, and others, all targeting 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 50.239.214.145.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host to mitigate impact.
