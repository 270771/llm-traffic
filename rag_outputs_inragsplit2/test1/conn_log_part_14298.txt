Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.175.248.229 and 69.46.227.121). This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to the same destination IPs matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and 130.197.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 52.175.248.229 and 69.46.227.121. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting high-volume ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack as per standard detection heuristics.
