Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP entries have no indication of type 8, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is less than 10 (only 1 instance with a count of 1 in the second entry).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.  
- The traffic volume and pattern do not match typical ping flood characteristics, which require multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) in rapid succession.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing full ICMP packet details, especially the ICMP type field, to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential future ping floods.
