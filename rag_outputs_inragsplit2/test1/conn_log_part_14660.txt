Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (52.237.221.62), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  
- The traffic pattern does not match other common attacks such as ICMP smurf or ICMP fragmentation attacks, as no anomalies or unusual flags are present.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP echo requests from these or other sources to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 52.237.221.62 is experiencing any service degradation or other suspicious activity.  
- If the count of ICMP type 8 packets rises above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for a potential ping flood attack.
