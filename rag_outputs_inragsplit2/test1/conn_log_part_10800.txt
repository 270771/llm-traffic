Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.183.65.24) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 35.183.65.24 with ICMP Echo Requests on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) targeting 35.183.65.24.
- Monitor the affected host (35.183.65.24) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are similarly targeted.
- Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or mitigate the flood traffic upstream if possible.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automatically respond to similar future events.
