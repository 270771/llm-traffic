Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the provided conn.log entries is consistently `1` (ICMP type 1 = Destination Unreachable), not `8` (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero; thus, the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP Echo Requests is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.  
- The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP error messages rather than a flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since ICMP type 1 messages are present, it may be worth investigating the cause of these unreachable messages to ensure no underlying network misconfigurations or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Correlate with other logs for potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Investigate the source IPs (203.78.180.123, 133.247.7.252) for unusual behavior in other protocols.
