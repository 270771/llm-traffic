Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 54.193.126.151 within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated ICMP ping flood.
- Although no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (known anomalous src/dst IPs) or a default heuristic for volumetric ICMP flood attacks.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP Flood.

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.x.x subnet and one from 85.61.2.107 (though that one is ICMP type 11, not type 8, so excluded).
- Destination IP: 54.193.126.151
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; the port fields are zero or dash.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor and log further ICMP traffic to detect escalation or changes in attack vectors.
- Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or mitigate traffic upstream if attack volume increases.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers).
- Alert network operations and incident response teams for continuous monitoring and potential escalation.
