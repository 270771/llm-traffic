Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting suspicious ICMP flood patterns) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.183.198, 163.252.91.217, 163.252.90.251, 163.252.202.62, 163.252.132.9, 203.78.176.185, 163.252.46.1, 163.252.115.211, 163.252.91.203, 133.251.127.197, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the source host 163.171.168.73 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
