Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- The source IP 54.200.201.221 is repeatedly sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range, consistent with a ping flood pattern where a single source floods one or more targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" based on standard network attack taxonomies.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 54.200.201.221 (attacker), multiple destination IPs in 203.78.148.51 to 203.78.190.225 range (victims). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.200.201.221 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood sources.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules on network devices.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or blackholing for traffic from the attacker IP if the flood persists.
- Review and update incident response playbooks to handle ICMP flood attacks.
