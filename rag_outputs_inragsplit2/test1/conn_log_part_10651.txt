Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.116.11.97 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.101.171, 133.247.42.126, 133.247.117.48, etc.) flooding the destination IP 3.116.11.97. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 3.116.11.97 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 3.116.11.97, matching the standard heuristic of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources.
