Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 18 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (commonly associated with ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP: Source IP 3.80.126.221 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 8 (ICMP type) in the log.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.80.126.221 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
