Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (44.53.158.231) sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.01 seconds). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where a host overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source targeting multiple destinations rapidly.
- The involved IP addresses are:
  - Source IP: 44.53.158.231
  - Destination IPs: Multiple in the 163.252.x.x range (e.g., 163.252.25.52, 163.252.246.250, 163.252.233.243, etc.)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming the ping nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 44.53.158.231 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if the source IP is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network monitoring tools to automate future detection.
