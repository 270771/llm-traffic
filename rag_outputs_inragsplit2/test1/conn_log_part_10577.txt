Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.183.65.24) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.183.65.24; Destination IPs include 163.252.183.114, 163.252.93.24, 163.252.25.244, and many others as listed in the log.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
5. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
