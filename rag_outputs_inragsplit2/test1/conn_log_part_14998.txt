Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The ICMP type 11 packet is not relevant to ping floods, as only type 8 (Echo Request) is considered.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or other heuristics.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of a single ICMP Echo Request and a Time Exceeded message is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 139.179.133.57 or destination IP 203.78.173.189 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
