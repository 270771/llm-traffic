Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 69.46.227.121 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets targeting a single destination, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from the 130.197.x.x subnet (e.g., 130.197.139.54, 130.197.23.195, 130.197.163.139, etc.) targeting destination IP 69.46.227.121 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 69.46.227.121 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse and coordinate with upstream providers to mitigate the attack traffic.
- If possible, apply geo-blocking or access control lists to restrict ICMP traffic to trusted hosts only.
