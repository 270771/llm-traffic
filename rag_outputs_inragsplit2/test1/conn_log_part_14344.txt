Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood detection (heuristic 20 in typical taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP echo requests from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific detection signatures in IDS/IPS systems to automate future detection and mitigation.
