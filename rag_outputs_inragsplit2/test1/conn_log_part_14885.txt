Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.118, and there is only 1 instance of this type.
- The other ICMP entry is type 13 (Timestamp Request), which is not type 8 and thus not relevant for ping flood detection.
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate accordingly.
