Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 3.22.191.77 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.37.57, 133.247.76.191, 133.247.187.212, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 3.22.191.77 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP 3.22.191.77 at the network perimeter or firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misconfiguration.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
  5. Document and update incident response playbooks to include this event for future reference.
