Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate normal ICMP error messaging. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 3 messages increase abnormally, as they may indicate network issues or scanning activity.
