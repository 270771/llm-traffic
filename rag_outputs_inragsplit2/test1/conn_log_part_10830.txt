Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears multiple times targeting 174.140.131.228 from various source IPs (e.g., 130.197.147.63, 130.197.139.41, 130.197.139.94, 130.197.62.249, 130.197.160.4).
- Counting the entries with ICMP type 8, there are at least 8 distinct instances targeting the same destination IP within the snippet, which is close but does not reach the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to override the threshold or indicate known suspicious IPs.
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11) are not relevant to ping flood detection.
- The traffic pattern does not show overwhelming volume or rapid repetition from a single source IP, which is typical in ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages suggests normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if the count exceeds 10 from one or multiple sources targeting the same destination.
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if their volume increases or if they appear in future anomaly reports.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
