Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.221.141.21) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, which typically falls under heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source IP 54.221.141.21 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.221.141.21 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Notify network operations to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected network devices.
  5. Review and update incident response plans to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
