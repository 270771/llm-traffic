Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IP 83.236.112.32 to 203.78.187.167 and 61.1.51.193 to 18.98.143.41). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 3, 128, 129) are not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and types 128/129 (ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply) may warrant routine monitoring but do not constitute an attack here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any single source.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or repeated unreachable messages that could indicate network issues or reconnaissance.  
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, correlate with IPs in this log for deeper analysis.
