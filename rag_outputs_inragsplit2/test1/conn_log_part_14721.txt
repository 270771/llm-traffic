Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination is recommended to detect future ping flood attempts.
