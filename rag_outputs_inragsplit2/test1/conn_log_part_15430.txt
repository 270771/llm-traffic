Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.160.194.189) within a very short time window, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, which is the required type for ping floods.
- The source IPs are multiple and varied (e.g., 130.197.23.251, 130.197.21.159, 130.197.61.122, etc.), indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 130.197.x.x range and one destination IP 16.160.194.189; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 16.160.194.189.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to detect possible amplification or coordinated attacks.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the destination host for potential service impact.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
