Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent to the single destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window (all timestamps around 1641099645.26-1641099645.27). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods:
  - ICMP type 8 is required (confirmed).
  - At least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 are present (confirmed).
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs:
  - Destination: 52.181.17.215 (target of the flood)
  - Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.201.228, 133.228.201.239, 133.228.214.17, etc.)
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 52.181.17.215 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing attack traffic if volume escalates.
- Deploy or tune Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify if source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and remediate accordingly.
