Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 and 0, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 13 corresponds to Timestamp Request, and type 0 is Echo Reply, which are not typically associated with flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm absence of ping floods.  
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Requests from any source IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
