Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the common heuristic that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 indicate a ping flood.
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121 is the attacker; destination IPs include 163.252.232.178, 163.252.232.67, 163.252.46.184, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic originating from 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
