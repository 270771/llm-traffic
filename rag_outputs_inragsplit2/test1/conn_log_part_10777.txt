Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.47.69.34 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one target matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is triggered here: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from different sources to the same destination IP.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in 133.247.33.141 through 133.247.238.189 range; destination IP 69.47.69.34; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 69.47.69.34.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 133.247.0.0/16 if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible coordinated DDoS.
  4. Notify network operations and consider deploying an anti-DDoS mitigation service.
  5. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or spoofing.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
