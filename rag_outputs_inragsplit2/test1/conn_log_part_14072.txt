Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (11) are not relevant to ping floods, as only type 8 (Echo Request) is considered.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The traffic pattern does not show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination in sufficient volume to qualify as a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more extended logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in source/destination IP behavior.
