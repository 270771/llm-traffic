Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 5 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known malicious actors or part of a recognized attack pattern.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be legitimate ICMP echo requests at a low volume.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 52.237.221.62 to multiple destination IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or match heuristic 20 once available.  
- Correlate with network performance metrics to detect any degradation that might indicate a slow or low-rate ping flood attempt.
