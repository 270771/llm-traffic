Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate traceroute or TTL-expired packets. Without heuristic context or anomalies, no further attack classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 packets increase abnormally, which could indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
