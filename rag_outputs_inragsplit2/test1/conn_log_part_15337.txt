Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are mostly 11 (Time Exceeded) and 8 (Echo Request). However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The presence of ICMP type 11 indicates traceroute or TTL-expired messages, not ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The lack of anomaly records and heuristic context limits further classification.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 11 messages if unusual volumes persist, as they may indicate network scanning or routing issues.
