Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows values 0, 1, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators matching heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal or unrelated ICMP traffic (e.g., type 0 = Echo Reply, type 1 = Destination Unreachable, type 11 = Time Exceeded).  

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if ICMP traffic volume spikes or if ICMP type 8 packets appear in future logs.  
- Monitor for any anomalies in source or destination IPs that may later match known heuristics once anomaly data is available.
