Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only 3 ICMP entries are present, fewer than the minimum 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic or anomaly data found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 messages typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate why multiple ICMP type 11 messages are being generated from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network misconfiguration or reconnaissance activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to confirm if any other attack patterns emerge.
