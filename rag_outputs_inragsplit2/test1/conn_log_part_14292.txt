Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows an ICMP type of 0 (indicated by the destination port field being 0, typical for ICMP), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the ping flood criteria. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another type of attack. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 202.194.36.224 to the destination 43.138.231.24 to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
