Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8 to indicate an echo request (ping).
- The snippet shows only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 11, type 0) do not indicate ping flood activity.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests and replies without volumetric flooding.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate the IP 133.247.49.34 and 157.187.159.183 for repeated ICMP echo requests if volume increases.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
