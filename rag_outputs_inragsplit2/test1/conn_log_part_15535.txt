Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the same destination IP 43.202.248.60 from at least seven distinct source IPs within a very short time frame (~9 seconds). This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the known heuristic that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 indicate a ping flood. Here, there are 7 distinct sources sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination, strongly suggesting a distributed ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Sources: 133.247.178.244, 133.247.28.30, 157.17.150.48, 133.247.169.135, 157.17.0.156, 133.247.169.154, 157.17.175.225
  - Destination: 43.202.248.60
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.
- Assign heuristic number 20 (based on the promptâ€™s mention of heuristic 20 related to anomalous IPs) and taxonomy class as "ICMP Flooding" (common classification for ping floods).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 43.202.248.60.
- Investigate and potentially block the source IPs listed to mitigate the attack.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to detect if this is part of a larger distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaign.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential escalation and consider deploying an upstream DDoS mitigation service if the attack volume increases.
