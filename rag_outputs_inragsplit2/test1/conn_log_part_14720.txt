Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp Request), neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since ICMP type 3 and 13 are normal control messages, no immediate threat is evident.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.
- Investigate if any future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.
- If anomalies appear, correlate with heuristic 20 (if available) or other heuristics related to ICMP floods.
