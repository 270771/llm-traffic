Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 157.17.45.201 to 44.61.16.153 with a single occurrence. This is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify patterns or anomalies over time.  
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.45.201 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests, as it may warrant further scrutiny.
