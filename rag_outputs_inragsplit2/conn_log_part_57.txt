Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly associates source IP 133.16.14.149 with heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class from the anomaly record is "icmp_error," which aligns with abnormal ICMP traffic patterns typical in ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; multiple destination IPs including 104.90.122.247, 184.6.70.20, 23.81.85.250, 23.253.244.251, 104.107.245.252, 23.251.151.251, 23.85.178.5, 2.208.27.251, 104.91.236.250, 104.121.213.250. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies from this and related IPs.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host and contain potential infection.
  5. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
