Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.29 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ping flood, where numerous ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources from the 130.197.x.x subnet (e.g., 130.197.23.195, 130.197.172.147, 130.197.144.133, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 69.47.68.29 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting 69.47.68.29.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
4. Conduct a forensic analysis to determine if the source IPs are compromised or spoofed.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders if mitigation at the firewall level is insufficient.
