Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating a high volume of ping requests consistent with a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class for this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to multiple destination IPs such as 23.179.212.0, 23.93.38.3, 23.87.216.9, 23.231.3.255, 23.70.181.253, 63.19.108.63, 104.90.1.253, 23.73.97.253, 23.245.219.228, 23.180.163.2, 23.85.236.3, 23.189.104.5, 23.230.11.251, and 23.240.229.252. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Relevant heuristic: 20 (Ping flood)
- Taxonomy class: "icmp_error" (ICMP-based denial of service)

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network traffic for any further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or being used as a bot.
4. Notify upstream providers or peers about the attack source IP to assist in broader mitigation.
5. Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules in network monitoring tools to detect and prevent recurrence.
