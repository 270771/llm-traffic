Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from IP 54.200.201.221 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range, as well as many other source IPs targeting 35.183.65.24.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests in a very short time window strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 54.200.201.221 is the primary attacker, with multiple destination IPs in 203.78.x.x and 35.183.65.24 as targets. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.200.201.221 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor affected destination IPs (203.78.x.x and 35.183.65.24) for service degradation or outages.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or abuse of the source IP.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP responsible for 54.200.201.221 to mitigate the attack at source.
