Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other suspicious traffic, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 is a catch-all for suspicious traffic not fitting other categories.
- Ping flood heuristic is 20, which is not triggered here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood indicated by heuristic 10 (anomaly_782) for potential TCP SYN flooding.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high ICMP traffic outside this snippet.
