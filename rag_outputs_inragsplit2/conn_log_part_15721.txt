Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting a single host) typically classified under "Denial of Service" (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs range across 133.228.62.233 to 133.228.252.62; Destination IP is 52.236.221.123; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the protocol indicator.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP traffic to 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter.
  2. Block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ongoing ping floods.
