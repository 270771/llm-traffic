Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 203.78.177.156 to destination 70.108.180.172, and there is only 1 instance recorded.
- The other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not related to ping floods.
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other attack type.

No attack is present. No further investigation is required based on this data.
