Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: Although there are multiple ICMP entries with type 8 (echo request) from source IP 54.253.199.134 to various destination IPs, the total count of such ICMP type 8 instances is fewer than 10 in this snippet. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known malicious actors (heuristic 20 or others). Other ICMP types present (3, 11) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and 11 (time exceeded) messages suggests normal network diagnostic or error traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IPs. Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if a threshold of 10+ echo requests is crossed or if heuristic 20 IPs appear. Without such evidence, no immediate security response is warranted.
