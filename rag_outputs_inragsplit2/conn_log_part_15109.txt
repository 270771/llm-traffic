Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting two distinct destination IPs: 13.86.47.233 and 54.29.238.156.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses:
- Targets: 13.86.47.233, 54.29.238.156
- Sources: Multiple IPs in ranges 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x

Ports:
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16 and 157.17.0.0/16) targeting the victim IPs.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers for possible source mitigation.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases.
