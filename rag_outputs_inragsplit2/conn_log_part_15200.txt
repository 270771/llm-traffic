Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries, only TCP and UDP connections.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to TCP port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are found here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080, as it indicates a possible SYN flood or TCP-based DoS attempt.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if the SYN attack is causing service degradation and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious IPs accordingly.
