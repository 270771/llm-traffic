Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets without corresponding replies indicate an attempt to overwhelm the targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic.
- Conduct further investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools.
- Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
