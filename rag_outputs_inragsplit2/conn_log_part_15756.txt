Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not 8. ICMP type 8 is required for echo request (ping) packets that constitute a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with types other than 8, and fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal control messages rather than flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets and check if their frequency increases to 10 or more from the same source IP.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving heuristic 20 if such data becomes available.  
- Continue logging and analyzing ICMP traffic for patterns consistent with known attack heuristics once context is provided.
