Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 1 (ICMP flood detection) commonly used in network security, and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.139.44, 163.252.239.46, 163.252.90.250, and multiple others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and verify if any are internal assets requiring additional protection.
- Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 52.236.221.123 to assess if it is a known malicious host.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential ongoing DoS impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
