Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets, this single ICMP type 11 packet does not match ping flood patterns. No anomalies or heuristics are present in the data to suggest another attack type. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns.
