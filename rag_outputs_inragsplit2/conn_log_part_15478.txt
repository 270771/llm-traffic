Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Since no ICMP traffic is observed, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected. The SYN attack heuristic (10) mentioned relates to TCP SYN floods, which is a different attack vector.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 for potential SYN flood activity.  
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for possible ping floods in the future.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules for SYN flood detection and mitigation.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by abnormal SYN packets on TCP ports.  
- Heuristic 20 would indicate a ping flood, requiring multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which are absent here.
