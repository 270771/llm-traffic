Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 69.47.68.48 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.71.98, 133.247.142.70, 133.247.149.60, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 69.47.68.48 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 69.47.68.48 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
  5. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
