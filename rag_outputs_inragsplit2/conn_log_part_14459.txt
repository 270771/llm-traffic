Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks: "Multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting a single host").
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources in 133.247.15.198 through 133.247.224.134 range, all targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or router to protect 157.187.159.183.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  3. Enable ICMP flood detection and mitigation features on network devices.
  4. Monitor for collateral impact and adjust filtering rules as needed.
  5. Notify network operations and affected parties to prepare for potential service degradation.
