Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. Counting these, there are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from 133.16.14.149, which matches the threshold for detecting a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP echo request floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 104.125.29.169, 23.235.56.252, 104.78.69.249, 104.94.63.3, 184.207.25.253, 23.230.247.4, 104.65.206.2, 173.50.143.137, 23.65.48.252, 23.71.183.3, 104.110.183.2).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
3. Investigate the source host 133.16.14.149 for compromise or misconfiguration causing the flood.
4. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
5. Coordinate with upstream providers if the attack volume affects external connectivity.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
