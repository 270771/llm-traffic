Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) counts toward ping flood detection. Here, there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 13.74.134.236 to 133.251.222.171).  
- The other entry is ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. ICMP type 11 could indicate traceroute or routing issues but is not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 messages correlate with network misconfigurations or routing loops.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to improve detection accuracy.
