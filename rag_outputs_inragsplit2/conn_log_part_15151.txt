Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.238.213.5 within a very short time frame (timestamps all around 1641099670.55). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x and one 202.194.17.61 range, all targeting destination IP 52.238.213.5 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the target host 52.238.213.5 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack consistent with heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
