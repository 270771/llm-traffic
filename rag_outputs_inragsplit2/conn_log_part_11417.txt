Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.76.138 to numerous destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, consistent with a volumetric ICMP ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and affected hosts.
- Conduct further investigation to determine if 54.183.76.138 is a compromised host or external attacker.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack source.
