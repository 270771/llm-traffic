Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 54.179.180.7 from many different source IPs in a very short time window, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.113.11, 157.17.227.54, 157.17.21.24, 157.17.250.46, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs show 0).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 54.179.180.7 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a network-wide review for other signs of coordinated DoS activity and prepare incident response for potential escalation.
