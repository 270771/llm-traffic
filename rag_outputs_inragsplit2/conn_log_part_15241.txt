Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is inconsistent and unclear. The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for a ping flood, but the provided entries show mixed values in the source and destination port fields (which are repurposed here for ICMP type and code). For example, some entries have ICMP type 8 in the destination port field, others have 0 or 8 in the source port field, making it ambiguous.  
- There are only 4 distinct ICMP connection entries involving type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.  
- The traffic volume and pattern do not show the rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by collecting more extended logs to verify if the number of ICMP type 8 packets increases significantly.  
- Confirm the correct parsing of ICMP type fields in the logs to avoid misinterpretation.  
- Monitor the involved IPs (173.235.215.96, 163.252.46.170, 163.252.46.168, 163.252.46.191) for any unusual ICMP traffic spikes.
