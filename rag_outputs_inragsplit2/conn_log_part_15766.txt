Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 157.17.234.185 to 185.75.204.50 with a single instance (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 0 (Echo Reply) from 109.27.242.141 to 202.194.58.232, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data indicate suspicious behavior from these IPs.  
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP misuse.
