Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.158.38.252. This exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, and categorizes the anomaly as 'ntscICecrqICecrprp' under the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy class. This matches the observed traffic pattern.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 18.158.38.252 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but are logged as 0.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 18.158.38.252 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or botnet involvement.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or broader DDoS activity.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack (heuristic 20, taxonomy NetworkScanICMP) targeting 18.158.38.252.
