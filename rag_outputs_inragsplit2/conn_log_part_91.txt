Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type field as `0` or `3` or `11` (seen in the 4th field after source IP), none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 anomalies are present.  
- No anomaly record or heuristic 20 (ping flood) is referenced in the anomaly CSV or logs. The only anomaly found is heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP (141.225.8.59) and unrelated ports.

The anomaly with heuristic 10 corresponds to a SYN attack, which involves TCP SYN packets, not ICMP traffic. This is consistent with the taxonomy where heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly_85 further for potential SYN flood or TCP-based DoS activity on IP 141.225.8.59.  
- Monitor ICMP traffic for any future presence of ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold.  
- Verify if other protocols or ports show suspicious activity related to heuristic 10.

No ping flood is detected in the current data.
