Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.42.116.124) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.42.116.124; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 52.42.116.124 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to prevent recurrence.
- Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic while allowing legitimate network diagnostics.
