Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly 0 or 11, not 8. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (157.17.50.10 â†’ 54.23.202.254), but there is only a single instance of this type.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.  
- The other ICMP types (0 and 11) correspond to Echo Reply and Time Exceeded messages, which do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or correlating with other logs for suspicious activity.
