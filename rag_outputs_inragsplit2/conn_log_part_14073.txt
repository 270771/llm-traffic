Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 130.197.147.188 to 52.237.221.62, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 13 (Timestamp Request), which does not qualify as a ping flood since only type 8 is relevant.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets is met over time.  
- Investigate the source IP 130.197.147.188 if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests without legitimate cause.
