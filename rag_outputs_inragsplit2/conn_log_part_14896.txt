Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack pattern is clearly indicated, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and types is recommended to detect any escalation.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 traffic is part of a traceroute or other legitimate diagnostic activity.  
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic volumes to better detect anomalies in the future.
