Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type relevant for ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x range and others (e.g., 61.1.51.193) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or multi-vector attacks.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misconfiguration on source hosts.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
