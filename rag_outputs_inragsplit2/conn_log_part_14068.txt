Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.33.149.154 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions), which relates to known anomalous source or destination IPs involved in ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from 133.247.20.20 through 133.247.244.0 range; destination IP 34.33.149.154; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16 or more specific subnets).
- Monitor the target host 34.33.149.154 for service degradation or outages.
- Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and assess if these IPs are compromised or spoofed.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to coordinate mitigation.
