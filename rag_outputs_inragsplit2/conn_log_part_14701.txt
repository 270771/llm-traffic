Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where a single source floods multiple targets with echo requests to overwhelm network resources.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source without known exceptions.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.241.39, 163.252.255.236, 203.78.180.43, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related sources.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 163.171.168.73 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify network operations to prepare for potential collateral impact on affected destination IPs.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
