Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IP 83.236.112.32 to 203.78.187.167 and 61.1.51.193 to 18.98.143.41). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (e.g., type 3, 128, 129) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and types 128/129 (ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply) suggest normal network diagnostic or error traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 if they persist or increase in frequency.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify emerging threats.
