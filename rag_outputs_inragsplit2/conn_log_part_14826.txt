Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The single ICMP record shows type 128 (ICMPv6 Echo Request), not type 8 (ICMPv4 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type for a ping flood.  
- Only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any known suspicious IPs or alternative attack patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMPv6 packet. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple ICMPv4 Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more connection logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.  
- Investigate if ICMPv6 traffic volume spikes or other ICMP types show suspicious patterns.
