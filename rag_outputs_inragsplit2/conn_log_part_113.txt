Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections targeting the same destination IP 3.30.218.60, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and multiplicity of unique source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination within a very short timestamp window strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_58) targeting 3.30.218.60, categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.119.223, 157.161.119.200, 157.161.67.21, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the destination host 3.30.218.60 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
  4. Deploy or tune anomaly detection systems to alert on sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block attack traffic closer to the source if possible.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, requiring immediate mitigation to protect the targeted host.
