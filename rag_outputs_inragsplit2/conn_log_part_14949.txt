Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records. The anomalies present relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), none of which indicate ICMP or ping flood activity.  
- The anomaly taxonomy classes found are 'ptmp' (heuristic 10) indicating SYN attacks, and 'heavy_hitter' (heuristic 999) indicating high-volume suspicious traffic, but not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, as SYN floods can be disruptive and may precede other attacks.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any ICMP traffic is filtered or logged elsewhere, as absence here does not guarantee no ICMP activity on the network.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, characterized by abnormal SYN flag usage on TCP ports.  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' indicates partial TCP message patterns consistent with SYN flood behavior.  
- Heuristic 20 (ping flood) and its taxonomy are not triggered here due to lack of ICMP type 8 packets.
