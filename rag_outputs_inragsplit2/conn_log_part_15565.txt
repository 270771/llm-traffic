Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log entry is 3, which is not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance shown, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest another attack type.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, ICMP type 3 indicates a "Destination Unreachable" message, which could warrant monitoring for network issues or misconfigurations but does not indicate an attack per the given criteria.
