Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP 52.190.120.127. This matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests targeting one host in a short time frame.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood attack, and the anomaly CSV confirms heuristic 20 is assigned to ICMP error anomalies related to ping floods.
- The taxonomy class relevant here is "icmp_error" under the "Other" category, consistent with the anomaly record anomaly_314.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.16.x.x range (e.g., 133.16.107.138, 133.16.104.83, 133.16.221.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the suspicious source IP range (133.16.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
  3. Monitor the destination host 52.190.120.127 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Conduct a source IP reputation check and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attack vectors.
