Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances.
- Involved IP: Source 54.183.69.91 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if 54.183.69.91 is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers or the ISP responsible for 54.183.69.91 to take action against the source.
