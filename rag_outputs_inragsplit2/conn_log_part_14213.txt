Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The connections target primarily two destination IPs: 52.158.11.176 and 3.121.216.42, indicating multiple sources are sending ICMP Echo Requests to these targets, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Source IPs include multiple 157.17.x.x addresses, and destination ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the destination IPs are clearly targeted.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy network-level filtering or firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets destined for 52.158.11.176 and 3.121.216.42.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or affected parties to coordinate mitigation efforts.
