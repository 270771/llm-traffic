Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from multiple source IPs (notably 69.47.68.36 and several 157.17.x.x addresses) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.86.31, consistent with a volumetric ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records are found, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and repetitive ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IPs: Sources include 69.47.68.36, 157.17.54.233, 157.17.17.58, 157.17.98.40, 157.17.98.70, 157.17.22.134, 157.17.63.224, 157.17.224.198, 157.17.231.254, 157.17.212.101, 157.17.17.207, 157.17.113.156; Destination IP is 34.25.86.31; ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type and destination IP indicate targeted flooding.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
3. Notify network operations to monitor the affected destination IP (34.25.86.31) for service degradation.
4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
5. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
