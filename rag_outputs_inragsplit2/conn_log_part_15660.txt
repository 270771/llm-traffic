Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 11 (code 0), which is a Time Exceeded message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this data. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
