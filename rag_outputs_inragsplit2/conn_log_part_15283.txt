Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, which are not typically associated with flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if additional logs show ICMP type 8 traffic in higher volume.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly data to better classify future suspicious ICMP traffic.
