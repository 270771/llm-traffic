Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 54.229.78.71 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs, indicating a coordinated flood rather than isolated pings.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this pattern aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from various sources targeting a single destination).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 133.247.76.187, 133.247.128.249, 133.247.165.166, 133.247.133.159, 133.247.26.193, 133.247.26.198, 133.247.123.105, 133.247.163.188, 133.247.76.186, 133.247.76.190, 133.247.47.253, 133.247.123.102 targeting destination 54.229.78.71 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the repeated ICMP echo requests confirm the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP traffic targeting 54.229.78.71 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential amplification or reflection attacks.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the destination host for impact and ensure it is hardened against ICMP floods.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
