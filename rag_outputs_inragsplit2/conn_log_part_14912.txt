Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 139.179.133.57 and 52.239.117.247). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) messages suggests normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (139.179.133.57, 52.239.117.247) show repeated or escalating ICMP Echo Requests in subsequent logs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
