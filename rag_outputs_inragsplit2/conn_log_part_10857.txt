Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 are present in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate pings or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in the volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 52.250.47.198 to multiple destinations.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if heuristic 20 or other known suspicious patterns emerge.  
- Investigate the source IPâ€™s reputation and check for any related alerts in other network segments.
