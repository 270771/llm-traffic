Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.230.228.52, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the Echo Request used in ping floods, and the volume of these requests from multiple source IPs in a short time frame strongly indicates a coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 requests from various sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.135.247, 133.247.80.11, 133.247.86.159, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.230.228.52.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
- Notify network operations to monitor for potential collateral impact and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a forensic review of the affected host 52.230.228.52 for any signs of service degradation or compromise.
- Prepare to escalate to upstream providers for traffic filtering if the flood volume increases or persists.
