Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), indicating an incomplete or unusual connection, but this alone does not imply an attack.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood or related ICMP-based attack.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.252. If counts rise above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, consider collecting heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
