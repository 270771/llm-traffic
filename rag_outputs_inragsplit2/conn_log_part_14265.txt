Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 35.127.34.186 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to a single target matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (Echo Requests) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (133.247.19.40, 133.247.129.116, 133.247.54.40, 133.247.153.68, 133.247.38.82, 133.247.44.20, 133.247.54.83, 133.247.11.30, 133.247.38.250, 133.247.19.27) targeting destination IP 35.127.34.186 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), confirming ping flood relevance.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 35.127.34.186 for service degradation or availability issues.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are known to be malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
