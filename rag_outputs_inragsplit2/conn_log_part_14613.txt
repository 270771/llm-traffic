Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 25 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet are simultaneously sending ICMP echo requests to the same destination IP, indicating a distributed ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting volumetric ICMP floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to resource exhaustion via ICMP.
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 157.17.249.53, 157.17.73.142, 157.17.138.237, etc.) targeting destination 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and throttle ICMP floods.
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger coordinated attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement attempts.
