Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (echo request) targeting the IP 16.160.152.89 from numerous distinct source IPs (e.g., 133.228.176.57, 133.228.141.12, 133.228.221.176, 133.228.116.244, 133.228.211.193, 133.228.210.10, 133.228.170.8, 133.228.220.5, 133.228.84.195, 133.228.240.125). There are at least 10 such instances, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- All relevant ICMP packets are type 8, which is the echo request type required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records are found, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs to detect possible amplification or coordinated attacks.
  3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to automatically block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  5. If possible, temporarily disable ICMP echo replies on the targeted host to mitigate impact while investigating.
