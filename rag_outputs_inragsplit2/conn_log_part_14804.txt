Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but fewer than 10 distinct instances are observed in the snippet.  
- Several ICMP entries have types other than 8 (e.g., type 11), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or others.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs, the traffic does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) suggests normal network diagnostic or routing issues rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious IPs or patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 if network issues are suspected.
