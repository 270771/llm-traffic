Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to ping floods) due to the volume and uniform ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 52.236.221.123; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are 0 as expected for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs (157.17.0.0/16 subnet) if they are internal or compromised hosts.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible lateral movement or botnet activity.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps such as blackholing or upstream filtering.
