Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP 13.242.241.56 to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or DDoS protection services.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic persists to coordinate blocking or filtering.
