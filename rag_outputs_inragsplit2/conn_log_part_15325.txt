Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection attempts; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The absence of ICMP traffic means the criteria for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20) are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically, as Zeekâ€™s conn.log may not log ICMP by default.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs (e.g., icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor for other suspicious traffic patterns, such as SYN floods or UDP floods, given the many TCP connection attempts with S0 flags indicating failed connection attempts. These may relate to reconnaissance or other DoS attempts.
