Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, and no anomaly records were found to suggest suspicious activity.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP packet. Without additional data or heuristics, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If multiple such packets appear rapidly (â‰¥10), re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, consider correlating with other logs or anomaly detection tools for broader context.
