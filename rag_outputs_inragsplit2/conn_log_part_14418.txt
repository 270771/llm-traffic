Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are from IPs 52.158.11.176 to 163.252.4.221 and 157.17.55.112 to 3.115.224.159, each appearing only once.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 in total, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 13, 0) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) messages appear isolated and do not form a pattern of flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP messages, especially if volume increases.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
