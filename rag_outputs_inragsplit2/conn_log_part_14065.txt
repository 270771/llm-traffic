Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but fewer than 10 instances are observed targeting the same destination IP. For example, multiple ICMP type 8 packets are sent to 34.33.149.154 from different source IPs, but the total count is below the threshold of 10 per instance.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 13) are present but do not indicate ping flood since only type 8 is relevant.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The traffic pattern does not match a volumetric ICMP echo request flood, which typically involves many repeated pings from one or multiple sources to overwhelm a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp) packets are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or scanning here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the source IPs (e.g., 133.247.148.3, 157.17.175.235) have prior suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Enable alerting on ICMP echo request counts exceeding the threshold to catch early ping flood attempts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned at this time.
