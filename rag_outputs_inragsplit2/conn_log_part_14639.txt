Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 157.17.59.6 to 161.67.57.135 and from 157.17.101.178 to 161.67.57.135). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (type 11 and type 0) do not correspond to ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related logs.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
