Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 25 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.179.180.7) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where numerous hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous source IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.194.45, 157.17.169.204, 157.17.200.202, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 54.179.180.7 with ICMP type 8 packets. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 54.179.180.7.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation or outages.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or participation in a botnet.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.
