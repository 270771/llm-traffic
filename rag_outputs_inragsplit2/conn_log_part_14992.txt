Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from the same source IP (139.179.133.57) to two different destination IPs (203.78.173.225 and 203.78.173.226). This count (2) is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (3, 11) are not type 8 and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 3 (Destination Unreachable) messages may be normal network behavior or unrelated errors.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests at higher volumes.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
