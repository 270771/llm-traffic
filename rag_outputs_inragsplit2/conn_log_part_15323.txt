Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 11 (code 0), which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other anomalies are present, no immediate security action is required. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs (133.247.253.38 and 185.164.46.143) is recommended to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
