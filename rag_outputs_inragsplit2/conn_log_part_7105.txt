Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one host is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.17.116 to 133.247.243.59 range, all targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP 52.230.228.52.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the victim host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests matching this pattern.
  5. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts part of a botnet or spoofed addresses.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack targeting 52.230.228.52, matching the known heuristic of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from numerous sources.
