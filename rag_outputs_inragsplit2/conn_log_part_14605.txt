Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have types 11, 3, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable, 0 = Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not match ping flood patterns.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving repeated ICMP Echo Requests.
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.
