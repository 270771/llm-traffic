Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.183.65.24 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" apply here.
- Involved IP: Source 35.183.65.24 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with DoS protection.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from this source if attack persists.
