Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (high volume ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges targeting destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 157.187.159.183.
- Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for further distributed ICMP floods and identify if source IPs are spoofed.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
