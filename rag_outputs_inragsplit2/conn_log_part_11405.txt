Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IPs 54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179 targeting numerous destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets from these sources within a very short time frame, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses:  
  - Attackers: 54.183.76.138, 3.122.197.179  
  - Targets: Multiple IPs in 163.252.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 163.252.252.234, 163.252.83.24, 163.252.150.90, etc.)  
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network edge devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179).
2. Deploy Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Notify upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic at their network perimeter.
4. Monitor network traffic for any further ICMP flood attempts or related anomalies.
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if these IPs are known malicious actors and not legitimate users.
6. Review and update incident response playbooks to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks promptly.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
