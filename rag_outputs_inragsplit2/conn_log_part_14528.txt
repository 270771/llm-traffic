Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 23 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (69.47.68.48) within a very short time window. This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP type 8 packets to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches were found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this matches the heuristic that requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to the same destination, indicating a ping flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one source from 202.194.17.61 (though the last entry is ICMP type 3, not type 8), all targeting destination IP 69.47.68.48 on ICMP protocol.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping flood detection.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16 and 202.194.17.61).
- Monitor the target host (69.47.68.48) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Consider deploying an ICMP flood mitigation appliance or service if available.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or abuse.
- If possible, apply geo-blocking or source reputation filtering to reduce traffic from suspicious or unknown sources.
- Log and retain all related traffic for forensic analysis and future tuning of detection heuristics.

This attack matches the known ping flood pattern: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources targeting a single destination in a short time frame, fulfilling the heuristic threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets.
