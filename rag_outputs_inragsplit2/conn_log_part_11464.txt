Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IP 52.181.17.215 from numerous distinct source IPs within a very short time window, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets indicate a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved (none are present here).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and 54.156.112.136 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.17.215.
  2. Investigate and potentially block the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or follow-up attacks.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact on the targeted host.
