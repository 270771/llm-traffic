Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 128, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.2). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The other ICMP types (128 and 11) do not correspond to ping requests and thus do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to detect potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
