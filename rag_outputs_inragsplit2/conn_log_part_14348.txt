Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (as per your instructions) related to known anomalous source IPs performing ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include 163.252.184.25, 163.252.125.48, 163.252.19.5, 163.252.19.100, 163.252.164.1, 163.252.248.193, 163.252.125.236, 163.252.125.205, 163.252.150.210, 163.252.46.92, 163.252.46.37, 163.252.9.189, 163.252.150.34, 163.252.248.143, 163.252.75.57, 163.252.228.192, 163.252.116.235, 163.252.52.145, 163.252.83.139, 163.252.63.249, 163.252.64.85.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of ICMP exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a threat intelligence check on 13.242.241.56 to determine if it is a known malicious actor.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify affected network administrators of the targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential impact or further investigation.
