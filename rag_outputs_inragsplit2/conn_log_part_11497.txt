Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating primarily from IP 18.112.90.42 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 10 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of one source IP sending numerous ICMP echo requests to various destinations is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the targets with excessive ping traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic detection for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies, indicating volumetric ICMP abuse).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.112.90.42; Destination IPs include 203.78.173.230, 203.78.173.218, 203.78.186.54, 203.78.170.52, 203.78.167.1, 203.78.178.220.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 (echo request) is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 18.112.90.42 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the abusive IP to assist in mitigation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch recurrence early.
