Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the snippet, there are only 3 entries with ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 114.175.15.85, 210.122.61.236, and 139.179.133.57). This is fewer than the threshold of 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (1, 3, 13) correspond to echo replies, destination unreachable, and timestamp requests, which are not indicative of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume of ICMP echo requests from a single source to a single destination, which is typical in ping flood attacks.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 13 (timestamp request) is normal network behavior and does not match common attack heuristics.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets, especially if counts exceed 10 from the same source IP to the same destination IP in a short time window.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs if they appear in anomaly logs or heuristic contexts.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
