Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 18.22.226.126 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. This matches the known ping flood pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm targets.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, this fits heuristic 1 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.22.226.126; Destination IPs include 163.252.200.198, 163.252.136.162, 163.252.143.181, 163.252.204.186, 163.252.252.235, 163.252.44.38, 163.252.192.71, 163.252.59.96, 163.252.78.244, 163.252.143.180, 163.252.238.74, 163.252.115.78.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.22.226.126 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
