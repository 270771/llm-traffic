Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- Since no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, the primary condition for detecting a ping flood is not met.  
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), but none mention heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the TCP SYN flags seen in the conn.log entries (S0 and SH states).  
- Therefore, the traffic pattern matches a SYN flood or scanning activity rather than a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential SYN flood or port scanning.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic separately to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Verify if any ICMP logs exist outside this snippet to rule out ping flood attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' refers to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
