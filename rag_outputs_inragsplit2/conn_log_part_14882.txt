Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (Echo Request) is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.121, but there is only 1 instance of this type 8 packet.  
- Another entry with ICMP type 13 (Timestamp Request) is present, but ICMP type 13 is not relevant for ping floods.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 anomalies are present, which are not found here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no known suspicious IPs or ports are flagged.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of other ICMP types (3, 10, 11) suggests normal network control messages (Destination Unreachable, Router Advertisement, Time Exceeded), not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.252.9.130 sending ICMP type 13 packets if unusual for the environment.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
