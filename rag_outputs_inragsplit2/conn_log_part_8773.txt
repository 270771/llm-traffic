Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the IP 44.61.12.164 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack, which aims to overwhelm targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a classic ping flood heuristic: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.61.12.164; Destination IPs include 163.252.44.80, 163.252.146.203, 163.252.50.30, 163.252.181.247, 163.252.127.1, and others in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 44.61.12.164 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
  5. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch similar future events.
