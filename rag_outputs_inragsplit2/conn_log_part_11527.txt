Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession from diverse sources to one target matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets without known exceptions. This matches the observed data.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.51.199, 133.247.51.181, 133.247.74.146, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of affected systems and network logs to assess impact and identify potential lateral movement or collateral damage.
