Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP, 54.166.249.180, from a wide range of source IPs (e.g., 133.247.163.213, 133.247.20.70, 133.247.57.148, 133.247.110.186, 133.247.168.6, etc.).
- This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 54.166.249.180; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.166.249.180.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic for collateral impact and ensure critical services on 54.166.249.180 remain available.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source if possible.
