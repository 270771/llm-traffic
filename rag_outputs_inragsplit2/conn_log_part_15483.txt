Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are mostly 1, 3, 8, and 13. Only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), and it appears only once (timestamp 1641099673.173068).  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No such anomalous IPs or heuristic context is provided here.  
- The other ICMP types (1 = echo reply, 3 = destination unreachable, 13 = timestamp request) do not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest another attack type.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or correlating with other logs to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
