Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.33.149.154, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- Multiple unique source IPs (mostly in the 133.247.x.x range) are sending these requests in rapid succession, indicating a distributed or coordinated flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods:
  - Heuristic 20 (commonly related to known anomalous IPs) is not triggered here.
  - The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP Ping Flood.
- Involved IPs:
  - Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 133.247.149.53, 133.247.117.17, 133.247.239.249, etc.)
  - Destination IP: 34.33.149.154
  - Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 34.33.149.154.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation.
- Monitor the victim host (34.33.149.154) for service degradation and prepare for potential escalation to other DoS vectors.
