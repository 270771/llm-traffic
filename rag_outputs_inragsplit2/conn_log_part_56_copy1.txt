Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log are mostly 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded), with only one entry showing ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is not met here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic pattern indicates multiple ICMP error messages rather than a flood of echo requests typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 and 11 messages could be normal network error or diagnostic traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the IP 203.65.114.222 or others.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for potential misconfigurations or scanning activity, as it is sending multiple ICMP error messages.
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
