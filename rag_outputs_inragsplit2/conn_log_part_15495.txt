Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries have type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there are only 6 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack, unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided, and no known suspicious IPs are indicated.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests distributed across multiple destination IPs.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume from the source IP 13.208.10.201. Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if the volume crosses the threshold or if heuristic 20 or other suspicious indicators emerge.
