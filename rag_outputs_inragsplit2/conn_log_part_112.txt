Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern for a ping flood attack. The ICMP type 8 is consistent across these entries, confirming the traffic is indeed ping requests.
- The destination IP 3.30.218.60 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs, indicating a high volume of ICMP echo requests aimed at overwhelming this host.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_58) targeting 3.30.218.60, categorized under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class from the anomaly record is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which aligns with NetworkScanICMP, a category that includes ping flood attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.161.x.x range and others (e.g., 61.56.227.30, 52.17.226.60) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the repeated ICMP type 8 packets confirm the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.30.218.60.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP ranges.
3. Monitor network traffic for further anomalies from the source IPs and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if the attack volume escalates.
5. Conduct a forensic analysis on 3.30.218.60 to assess any impact and ensure system integrity.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and classified under NetworkScanICMP taxonomy.
