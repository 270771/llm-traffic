Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 133.247.185.196 and 157.187.159.183, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without multiple repeated ICMP Echo Requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears normal or benign.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if any other logs or anomaly data show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or related suspicious activity.
