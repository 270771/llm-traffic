Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.36.162.241 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources primarily in the 133.247.x.x range and one from 61.216.156.137, all targeting destination IP 18.36.162.241 on ICMP type 8.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (common for volumetric ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
  2. Monitor the target host 18.36.162.241 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Conduct a full network scan to identify any compromised hosts participating in the attack.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures/rules to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
