Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- Since ICMP type 8 is required for ping floods and there are fewer than 10 instances of type 8, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other attack types.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
