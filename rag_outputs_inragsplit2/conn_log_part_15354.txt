Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears in multiple entries from source IP 13.75.4.206 to various destination IPs (133.251.203.166, 133.251.210.62, 133.251.201.197, 133.251.201.158), but only 5 such instances are present in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- No other attack patterns (e.g., ICMP type 3 or 11 indicating unreachable or time exceeded messages) are present in sufficient volume or pattern to suggest a different attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IP 13.75.4.206 for unusual ICMP activity as a precaution.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further assessment.
