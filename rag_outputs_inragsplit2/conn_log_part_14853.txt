Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Only two ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instances are present (from IPs 222.88.115.43 and 139.179.133.57). This is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are present, which do not correspond to ping flood behavior.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) may be normal network diagnostic traffic or unrelated errors.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs have prior suspicious activity in other datasets.
