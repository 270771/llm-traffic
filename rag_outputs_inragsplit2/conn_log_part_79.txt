Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.87.6 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- According to the heuristic context, heuristic 20 corresponds to a ping flood, and the anomaly taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of this ICMP-based DoS attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.87.6; Destination IPs range from 163.210.95.179 through 163.210.95.203.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 129.43.87.6 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.

This targeted response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood and prevent further network degradation.
