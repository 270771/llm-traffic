Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, satisfying the requirement for ping flood detection.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, confirming the volume threshold.
- No anomaly records or heuristic 20 matches are present to exempt this detection.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels given the nature of the attack.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple from 157.17.26.52 through 157.17.238.95 (at least 20 unique sources)
- Destination IP: 54.179.180.7
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 157.17.0.0/16 if feasible.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blackholing attack traffic if it originates externally.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
- Update IDS/IPS signatures to detect similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
