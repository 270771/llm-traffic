Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP traffic present has type 1 (ICMP type field in Zeek conn.log corresponds to the ICMP code or type; here the second IPâ€™s port field is 1, indicating ICMP type 1, which is "Destination Unreachable," not Echo Request type 8).
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- Only one ICMP connection is logged, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if more ICMP Echo Requests appear in subsequent logs.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
