Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating predominantly from IP 18.112.90.42 to multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range within a very short time window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records are found, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood: "At least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets indicate a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are present," which is not the case here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.112.90.42 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (203.78.148.101, 203.78.186.200, 203.78.148.102, 203.78.184.230, 203.78.189.189, 203.78.183.227, 203.78.178.99, 203.78.178.92, 203.78.171.216, 203.78.184.232, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.174.99, 203.78.183.157, 203.78.180.45, 203.78.180.59, 203.78.174.114, 203.78.184.64).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.112.90.42 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect potential coordinated attacks.
3. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source host 18.112.90.42 for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP traffic thresholds and alerting to detect future ping flood attempts early.
5. Consider deploying anti-DDoS solutions if this is part of a larger volumetric attack.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
