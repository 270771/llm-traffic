Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from source IP 110.220.22.222 to destination 203.78.187.167, and there is only 1 such instance in the snippet.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 0, 3, or 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP.  
- Investigate if any of the source IPs repeatedly send ICMP Echo Requests in larger volumes.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
