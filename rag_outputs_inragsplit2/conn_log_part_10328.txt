Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 24 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (44.51.211.229) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.51.211.229; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 44.51.211.229 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources exhibiting similar ICMP flood behavior.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify the ISP or upstream provider about the malicious traffic source for potential upstream filtering or takedown.
