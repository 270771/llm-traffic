Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP entries show types 128 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types observed (128 = Echo Reply, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not match typical flood or scanning patterns.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if additional logs show repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests to detect potential ping floods early.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data once available to identify suspicious behavior.
