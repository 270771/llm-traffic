Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 73.90.204.98 to 203.78.187.167, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 73.90.204.98 if repeated ICMP Echo Requests persist.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm or rule out low-rate ICMP-based attacks.
