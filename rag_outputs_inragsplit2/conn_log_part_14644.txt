Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack patterns based on the limited data.

No heuristic or taxonomy classification can be assigned due to lack of anomaly data and heuristic context.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect a larger time window of conn.log data to verify if a ping flood pattern emerges.  
- Investigate if these IPs have any prior history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
