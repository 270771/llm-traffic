Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 3.83.92.175, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.211.193, 133.228.211.189, 133.228.214.27, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the target host 3.83.92.175 for service degradation or outages and consider isolating it if impact is severe.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in similar ICMP flood activity.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is large to coordinate mitigation.
