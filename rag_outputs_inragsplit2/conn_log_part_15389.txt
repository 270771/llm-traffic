Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters on TCP ports, not ICMP.

The anomalies detected correspond to:
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack (anomalies 782 and 2012, categorized as 'ptmp')
- Heuristic 999: Heavy hitter or multi-port anomalies (anomalies 1402 and 1442)

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 and source IP 185.58.127.74 on port 1433.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if the heavy hitter anomalies (heuristic 999) indicate scanning or brute force attempts.

No ping flood is detected because the required ICMP type 8 packets are absent, and no heuristic 20 anomalies are present.
