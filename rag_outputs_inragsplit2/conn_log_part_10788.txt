Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.179.180.7, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches were found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this fits the general heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from various source IPs to a single destination IP.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs primarily in the 157.17.x.x range and others, all targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or scrubbing center if the attack volume escalates.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service impact and investigate upstream sources for mitigation.
