Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type used here, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- The volume and multiplicity of unique source IPs (e.g., 133.228.232.1, 133.228.191.247, 133.228.23.230, etc.) sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single target strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ping requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range and destination IP 68.104.133.69; ICMP protocol, port fields irrelevant for ICMP.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 68.104.133.69.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and identify if the source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host to mitigate impact.
