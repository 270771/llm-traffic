Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.158.38.252. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to identify a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern matches a classic ping flood: multiple source IPs sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously to one victim IP, overwhelming it with ICMP traffic.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack, and categorizes the anomaly as "ntscICecrqICecrprp," a label consistent with NetworkScanICMP and DoS-related anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.250.248, 157.161.129.212, 157.161.105.171, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 18.158.38.252.
  3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Monitor the victim host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "ntscIC" (NetworkScanICMP), consistent with DoS attack patterns.
