Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present only twice (from 133.228.147.254 and 133.228.237.48 to 52.236.221.123). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types seen (3, 1, 11, 0) are not type 8 and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 133.228.147.254 and 133.228.237.48 for unusual activity if the volume increases.  
- Collect more data or anomaly context to correlate with other suspicious behavior.
