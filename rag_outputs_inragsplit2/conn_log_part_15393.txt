Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 128, which is not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to identify patterns or repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related anomalies once heuristic context or anomaly data becomes available.
