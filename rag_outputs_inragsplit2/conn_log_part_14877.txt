Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first ICMP entry shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- The second ICMP entry is type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance of it, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of ICMP type 3 may indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any repeated ICMP type 3 messages if they correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.
