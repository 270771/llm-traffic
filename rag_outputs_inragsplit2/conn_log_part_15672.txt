Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 133.247.49.34 to destination 23.210.14.195, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3, 11, and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) connection state and low packet counts do not suggest a volumetric or sustained attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in related logs.  
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with IPs in this log for further analysis.
