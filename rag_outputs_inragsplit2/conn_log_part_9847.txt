Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.166.249.180 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.166.249.180. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests to 54.166.249.180 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Conduct traffic filtering to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets from the identified source IP range. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting persistent offenders. Additionally, verify the availability and performance of the targeted host to mitigate service disruption.
