Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any known suspicious IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood activity.
- Without ICMP traffic, especially type 8, the conditions for detecting a ping flood are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP connection attempts mostly show SYN packets with no established sessions (S0 state), which could indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically.
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to identify possible flooding.
