Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.161.126.169) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are echo requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood in absence of known anomalous IPs.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 16.161.126.169 with ICMP echo requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (16.161.126.169) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage incident response to trace back the source of the flood and consider upstream provider coordination to block malicious traffic.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
