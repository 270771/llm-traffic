Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 35.119.5.36 and 139.179.133.57). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3 and 128) are not type 8 and thus do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 128 (Echo Reply) is normal in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs 35.119.5.36 and 139.179.133.57 if their ICMP traffic volume rises or if other anomalies appear.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
