Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic that at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to the same destination indicate a ping flood.
- The involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and destination IPs 54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the affected destination IPs (54.186.100.117 and 3.231.100.178) at the network perimeter firewall or router.
- Block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
