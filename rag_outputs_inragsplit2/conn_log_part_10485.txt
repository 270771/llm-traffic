Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source without known exceptions.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 1** (ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any other sources exhibiting similar ICMP flood behavior.
4. Alert the incident response team to investigate the source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
