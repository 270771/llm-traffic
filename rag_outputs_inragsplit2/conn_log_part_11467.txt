Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.89.92, 133.228.119.198, 133.228.9.238, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate given the volume and nature of traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 52.181.17.215 for service degradation or outages.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts in a botnet.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Reply responses on the target host to reduce attack surface.
