Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek log is the 4th column (value 8 indicates echo request). Here, multiple entries show ICMP type 8 as the source port (4th column) for 3.231.100.178, indicating echo requests sent to various destination IPs.  
- There are at least 4 instances of ICMP type 8 from 3.231.100.178, but the threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 instances unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- One entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 157.17.59.190 to 52.175.248.229, which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests at a low volume.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency from 3.231.100.178 to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.  
- Investigate if 3.231.100.178 is a legitimate host or if it has been compromised.  
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
