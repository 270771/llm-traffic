Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.236.221.123 within a very short time frame (~0.006 seconds). This volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets is consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomalies or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from multiple source IPs targeting the same destination IP rapidly.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8, confirming Echo Requests.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further volumetric ICMP attacks.
  5. Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
