Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. Ping flood attacks require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single OTH (other) connection log entry with ICMP type 11. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns from these IPs.
