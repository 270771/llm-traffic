Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (3.231.100.178) from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range, as well as multiple ICMP type 8 packets from 161.67.42.226 to various 203.78.x.x IPs.
- This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame, especially from multiple sources to a single destination, matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known heuristic for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 161.67.42.226, 133.247.96.67, 133.247.48.1, 133.247.176.57, 133.247.153.189, 133.247.94.58, 133.247.156.143, 133.247.24.1, 133.247.55.243, 133.247.96.137, 133.247.145.201, 133.247.55.46, 133.247.145.177, 133.228.141.10 (less relevant as ICMP type 10)
- Destination IPs: 3.231.100.178 (primary target), multiple 203.78.x.x IPs targeted by 161.67.42.226
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so ports are irrelevant here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to block or throttle excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood (especially 161.67.42.226 and the 133.247.x.x subnet) using firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering with the ISP if the volume exceeds local mitigation capacity.
