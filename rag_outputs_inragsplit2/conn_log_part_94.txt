Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
