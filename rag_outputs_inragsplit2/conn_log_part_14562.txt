Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.9.51.14) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.9.51.14; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.9.51.14 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices to prevent recurrence.
