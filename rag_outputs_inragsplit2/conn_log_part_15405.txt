Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided snippet, so the minimum threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative suspicious activity.
- ICMP types 3 and 13 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Timestamp Request, respectively, which do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window.
- Checking for other anomaly sources or logs that might indicate different attack vectors.

Since no heuristics or taxonomy data are provided, no further classification can be made at this time.
