Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches a classic ICMP ping flood pattern, where an attacker overwhelms targets with excessive ping requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to one or more destinations, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.245.210, 163.252.0.198, 163.252.9.149, 163.252.65.203, 163.252.145.254, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic to avoid disrupting network diagnostics.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
