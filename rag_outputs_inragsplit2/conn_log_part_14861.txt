Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and alert their administrators.
  3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to identify compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
