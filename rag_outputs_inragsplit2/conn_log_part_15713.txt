Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The majority of ICMP packets have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 9 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123, and one additional entry to 37.140.217.191, totaling fewer than the required 10 instances to confirm a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known malicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- One ICMP packet has type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from a single source to a single destination that would indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate the source IP 133.228.147.249 and 52.236.221.123 for any unusual behavior or prior alerts.  
- Enable logging or alerting on ICMP traffic volume thresholds to catch future ping flood attempts.
