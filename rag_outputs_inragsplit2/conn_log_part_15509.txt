Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are mostly 3 and 1, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request, which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, so the fundamental condition for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative suspicious activity.
- The observed ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 1 (Host Unreachable) indicate error messages rather than flood traffic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP error messages (types 1 and 3) from 203.78.179.39 to various destinations, as this could indicate network issues or scanning activity.
- Collect more data including ICMP type 8 packets to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
- Enable anomaly detection and heuristic logging to better classify future suspicious traffic.
