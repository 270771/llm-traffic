Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 44.61.16.153 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a single target).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the volume and nature of ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.175.234, 157.17.68.39, 157.17.188.126) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 44.61.16.153 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 44.61.16.153 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage network operations to trace and possibly filter or null-route offending source IPs.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood thresholds and anomaly-based IDS signatures.
  5. Review and update incident response plans to handle ICMP-based DoS attacks.
