Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.49.34) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Identify and block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP ranges.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
