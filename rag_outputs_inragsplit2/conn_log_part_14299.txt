Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the same source IP 3.231.100.178 targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time frame, consistent with a ping flood pattern where a single host sends numerous ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm targets.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Source IP 3.231.100.178; Destination IPs include 163.252.10.139, 163.252.67.118, 163.252.134.193, 163.252.232.243, 163.252.232.93, 163.252.104.16, 163.252.151.211, 163.252.200.198, 163.252.38.42, 163.252.237.196, 163.252.237.217, 163.252.132.27.
- Ports are ICMP type 8, which do not use ports but ICMP identifiers are not shown here.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.231.100.178 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and increase logging for further analysis.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are involved or affected.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
