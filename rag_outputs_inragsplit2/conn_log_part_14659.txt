Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP entries present show ICMP types other than 8 (echo request). The first entry has no explicit ICMP type field but the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero.
- The second entry shows an ICMP connection with zero packets and no indication of ICMP type 8.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, which is below the threshold for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if more detailed ICMP type fields or packet counts become available.
- Monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods.
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
