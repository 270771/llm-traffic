Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping flood attacks.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DoS protection features.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to prevent similar attacks in the future.
