Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest any other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, which is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
