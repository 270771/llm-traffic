Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 8 distinct instances targeting 43.202.248.60 are visible within the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- The other ICMP entries either have different types (e.g., type 3 or 13) or are isolated single packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show the volume or repetition pattern typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) state flags and lack of anomalies suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume from multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if they continue or increase, especially 133.247.178.244, 133.247.28.30, 157.17.150.48, and others targeting 43.202.248.60.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems for emerging patterns.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic number or taxonomy class can be assigned at this time.
