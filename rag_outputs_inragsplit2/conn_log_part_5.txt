Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated with this anomaly is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs including 23.69.216.255, 23.219.85.250, 104.117.176.250, 95.101.127.246, 23.82.153.249, 23.239.47.5, 104.84.130.5, 184.201.178.2, 23.80.164.7.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any additional ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external to coordinate blocking or filtering.

This targeted response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood and reduce the risk of denial-of-service impact.
