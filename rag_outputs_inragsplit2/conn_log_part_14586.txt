Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP type 8 packets are present.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; they only show heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 specifically corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination.
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are logged and no heuristic 20 anomalies are present, no ping flood is detected.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) noted in anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012, as these indicate potential SYN flood or SYN scanning activity.
- Monitor for any future ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high ICMP traffic outside this log snippet.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is present based on the provided data.
