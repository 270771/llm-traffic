Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only the entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is relevant for ping floods. However, there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs appear in future anomaly records or if heuristic 20 (if known) applies.  
- Collect more extended logs to confirm or rule out low-volume or slow-rate ping floods.
