Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, anomalies relate to TCP ports and other heuristics (10 and 999).  
- Heuristic 20 specifically targets ping flood detection via ICMP type 8 traffic, which is absent here.

No other attack type matching the current data is evident. The anomalies mostly relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), which are unrelated to ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) further, as multiple TCP SYN flags (S0) are present in the logs, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Verify if any ICMP logs exist outside this snippet to confirm no ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN flag usage.  
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to other or unknown anomalies, often heavy hitters or multi-port scans.  
- Taxonomy classes like 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' relate to partial or multi-port scanning, not ping floods.
