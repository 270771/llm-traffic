Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. Specifically, there are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from IP 161.67.42.226 targeting multiple destination IPs in the 203.78.x.x range within a very short time window. This pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: ICMP type 8 with at least 10 instances from the same source IP.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 161.67.42.226 is the apparent attacker sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs including 203.78.170.52, 203.78.186.53, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.174.82, 203.78.173.222, 203.78.184.33, 203.78.178.94, 203.78.179.89, and 203.78.174.116. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 161.67.42.226 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
