Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The provided Zeek conn.log snippet shows only two ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since ICMP type 8 is present but in very low volume, this traffic appears to be normal ping activity rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP Echo Requests from these or other IPs. If the count rises above 10 or if anomalies appear in future logs, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
