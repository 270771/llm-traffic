Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one IPv6 source, all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 52.237.221.62. Block or throttle offending source IPs if possible. Monitor for continued ICMP flood activity and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate this attack. Notify network operations to investigate potential impact on the target host.
