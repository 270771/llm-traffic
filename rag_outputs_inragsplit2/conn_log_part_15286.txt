Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and other categories, but none indicate ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches some anomalies in the CSV.  
- Heuristic 20 is specifically for ping flood attacks, which are absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as multiple SYN flood attempts are indicated by TCP flags and anomalies on suspicious ports.  
- Enable or verify ICMP logging to capture potential ICMP traffic for future detection of ping floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to detect emerging ping flood attacks.
