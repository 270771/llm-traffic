Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward a single destination IP 54.228.4.24, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type involved here, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from various sources targeting one host) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.179.176, 157.17.73.83, 157.17.45.255, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.228.4.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

**Recommended Security Response Plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.228.4.24.
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from the identified source IP ranges.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential amplification or lateral movement.
4. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offending IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
6. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary use cases only.
