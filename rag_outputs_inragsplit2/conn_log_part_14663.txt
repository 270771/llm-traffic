Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame (all timestamps are nearly identical). This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one host) typically classified under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source IP 222.88.115.43 are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.237.221.62. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact and verify if the target host is experiencing service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate similar ICMP floods.
  5. Investigate source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and block if confirmed malicious.
