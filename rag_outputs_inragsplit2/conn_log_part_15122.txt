Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to identify if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate if these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other datasets.
