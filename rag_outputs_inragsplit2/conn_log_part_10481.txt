Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.183.69.91 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits the common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from a single source to many destinations.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (commonly associated with ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP: Source IP 54.183.69.91 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.183.69.91 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP floods or related anomalies from this or other IPs.
3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential impact on the targeted hosts.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical infrastructure.
