Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP packets have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid succession of ICMP echo requests from the same source to multiple destinations that would indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP echo requests from 54.250.161.90.  
- Investigate if this IP is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.  
- Collect more data to determine if the pattern escalates into a ping flood or another ICMP-based attack.
