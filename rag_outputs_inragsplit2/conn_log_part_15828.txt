Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8 across these entries, confirming these are ping requests rather than other ICMP types.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.174.242, 133.247.86.68, 133.247.231.165, 157.17.164.68, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a small set of destination IPs (notably 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55), indicating a distributed pattern typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ICMP flood detection, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources targeting one or few destinations).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" based on the nature of the traffic.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 157.17.174.242, 133.247.86.68, 133.247.231.165, 157.17.164.68, 133.247.29.247, 157.17.60.6, 157.17.185.11, 157.17.108.45, 133.247.158.68, 133.247.20.223, etc.
- Destination IPs: Primarily 52.236.221.123 and 3.20.96.55.

Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic if the attack volume is large.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited and improve network resilience against ICMP floods.
