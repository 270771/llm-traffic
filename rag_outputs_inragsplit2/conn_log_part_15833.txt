Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (echo request) entries are two connections from different source IPs (157.17.59.128 and 157.17.231.174) to the same destination (52.236.221.123).  
- There are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present. No anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to suggest these IPs are suspicious.  
- The other ICMP entry (type 9) is not relevant to ping floods, as only type 8 is considered.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated in the snippet. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 52.236.221.123 is experiencing unusual ICMP traffic volume over a longer period.
