Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.137.226, 157.17.30.133, 157.17.137.129, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 35.169.51.96. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor the target host (35.169.51.96) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or participation in a botnet.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack consistent with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting one destination), classified under the taxonomy of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
