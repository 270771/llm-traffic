Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify ping floods.  
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which is a TCP SYN anomaly, not ICMP or ping flood related.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, but no such heuristic or matching anomaly is found here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on 89.3.89.164:8080 further, as SYN floods can be a precursor or alternative DoS attack.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' here relates to partial TCP connection attempts, not ping floods.
