Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.30.218.60 within a very short time frame. This volume and pattern of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to "Ping flood" in the heuristic context. The taxonomy class associated with these anomalies is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which falls under the NetworkScanICMP category, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IP addresses:
  - Destination IP: 3.30.218.60 (target of the ping flood)
  - Source IPs: Multiple distinct IPs in the 157.161.x.x range (e.g., 157.161.37.209, 157.161.233.143, 157.161.195.83, etc.)
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request), confirming the nature of the traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 3.30.218.60.
2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or involvement in a botnet; consider blocking or blacklisting these IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
4. Notify the owner/operator of 3.30.218.60 to prepare for potential service degradation and coordinate mitigation efforts.
5. Review and update incident response playbooks to include automated detection and mitigation of ICMP flood attacks based on heuristic 20 indicators.
