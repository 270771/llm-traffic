Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11 (as indicated by the 4th and 6th fields, e.g., `3` and `0`), but none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none at all.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types observed (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
