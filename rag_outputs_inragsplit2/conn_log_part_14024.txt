Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.206.231.130 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 157.17.0.0/16 targeting 54.206.231.130.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and block attack sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation and apply host-based ICMP rate limiting.
