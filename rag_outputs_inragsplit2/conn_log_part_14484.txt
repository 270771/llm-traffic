Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries at all; all entries are TCP or UDP.  
- No ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are present, which is mandatory to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further, as it indicates suspicious TCP SYN packets possibly related to a SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP echo request spikes in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any other logs or sensors capture ICMP traffic to rule out ping flood attempts.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating abnormal SYN packet behavior on suspicious ports.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior.
