Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 16.160.194.189 from different source IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 11 distinct ICMP type 8 entries, exceeding the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from 130.197.x.x subnet and one from 202.194.58.65 (though that one is ICMP type 0, not type 8), all targeting 16.160.194.189 on ICMP port 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 16.160.194.189 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or participation in a botnet.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules to prevent recurrence.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams for further containment and forensic analysis.
