Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references a SYN attack (heuristic 10) related to TCP traffic, not ICMP or ping flood.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood, but no such heuristic or related anomalies appear in the data.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further, as it indicates potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for SYN flood patterns and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious source IPs like 139.64.111.127.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
