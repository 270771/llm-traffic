Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.206.231.130) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.21.11, 157.17.136.165, 157.17.97.89, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.206.231.130 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.206.231.130.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  4. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or mitigate the attack if it persists.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically for ICMP flood detection and mitigation.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
