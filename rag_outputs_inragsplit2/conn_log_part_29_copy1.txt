Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.158.38.252 within a very short time window. This matches the known ping flood pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelming a target.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies destination IP 18.158.38.252 as anomalous under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class from the anomaly CSV is "ntscICecrqICecrprp," which aligns with NetworkScanICMP anomalies, consistent with ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 18.158.38.252 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network devices.
  4. Conduct a forensic analysis on source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  5. Notify upstream providers to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic if the attack persists.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and the NetworkScanICMP taxonomy.
