Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only one record shows ICMP type 8 (echo request), and it appears only once. The other record is ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, but no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided here.  
- No repeated or high-frequency ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination are evident in the snippet.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly records or heuristics are available, no taxonomy or heuristic number can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns.  
- Investigate if any of the IPs (203.78.177.156 or 202.194.15.246) have prior suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.
