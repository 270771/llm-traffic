Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating primarily from source IP 133.16.14.149 and 13.245.92.211 targeting multiple destination IPs. This volume and pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with ICMP-based flooding anomalies.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 13.245.92.211
  - Destination IPs: Multiple, including 104.125.39.248, 104.127.118.4, 104.120.243.4, 23.236.5.253, 90.32.69.19, 163.210.231.251, 163.210.183.6, 163.210.36.249, 163.210.17.249, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) confirms the nature of the traffic.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 and 13.245.92.211 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flooding from other sources.
3. Investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse, as they are generating suspiciously high ICMP traffic.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to assist in blocking malicious traffic if the attack volume is large.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the taxonomy class "icmp_error," confirming the diagnosis and guiding the mitigation steps.
