Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type 3 or 11, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The count of ICMP type 8 messages is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances.
- ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) indicate error or control messages, not ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messaging.

Next steps:
- Investigate why there are multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages from 203.65.114.222 to various destinations, as this could indicate network issues or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any future increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.
- If anomaly or heuristic data becomes available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
