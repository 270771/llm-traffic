Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 11, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 11 (Time Exceeded) and 3 (Destination Unreachable) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with any network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
