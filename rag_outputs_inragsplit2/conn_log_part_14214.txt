Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 52.158.11.176 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.3.52, 157.17.160.114, 157.17.248.98) targeting destination IP 52.158.11.176 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns targeting 52.158.11.176.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP range.
- If possible, coordinate with upstream providers to filter or rate-limit ICMP traffic before it reaches the target network.
