Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for all relevant entries except one is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping). However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 targeting the same destination IP (52.236.221.123), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- One entry shows ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 52.236.221.123 is experiencing any service degradation or other suspicious activity.  
- Collect additional anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
