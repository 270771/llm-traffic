Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP traffic on port 8080, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which matches the SYN flag-heavy TCP traffic seen in the logs (many connections with SYN flags and no completions).  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in the anomaly CSV is associated with port-based anomalies, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the suspicious TCP SYN traffic from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further for potential SYN flood or port scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible future ping flood attempts.  
- Verify firewall and IDS rules to ensure SYN flood mitigation is active and tuned.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomaly aligns with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and taxonomy class 'ptmp' (port-based anomaly).
