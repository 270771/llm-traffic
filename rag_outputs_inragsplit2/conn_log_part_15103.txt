Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs sending ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) to a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) within a very short time frame, matching the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- The volume and concentration of these echo requests strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (commonly associated with volumetric ICMP flood attacks) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 13.86.47.233; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are irrelevant for ICMP but logged as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy or tune existing DDoS mitigation tools to filter or absorb ICMP flood traffic targeting 13.86.47.233.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack escalates.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify vulnerabilities exploited and update firewall/IDS rules accordingly.
