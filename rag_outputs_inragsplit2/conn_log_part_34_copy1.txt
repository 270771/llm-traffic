Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are predominantly 11 and 0, with only a few entries showing ICMP type 8 (echo request). Specifically, there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets overall, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack unless heuristic 20 applies. The anomaly CSV indicates heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is associated with destination IP 3.20.63.105, but the log shows only one anomaly record related to that IP and no sustained flood pattern.

The anomaly taxonomy "ntscICecrqICecrprp" corresponds to NetworkScanICMP, indicating suspicious ICMP scanning activity rather than a flood. Heuristic 20 stands for Ping flood, but since the volume and ICMP type criteria are not met, this is likely a network scan or reconnaissance attempt.

Next steps: Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets (e.g., 52.19.157.21, 54.235.171.181, 52.74.1.7) for potential scanning behavior. Monitor for increased ICMP echo requests or other suspicious patterns that may escalate into a DoS attack. Also, verify if the IP 3.20.63.105 is a critical asset requiring additional protection.
